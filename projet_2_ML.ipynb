       "['Richard Arnold \"Groove\" Holmes, Born Richard Arnold Jackson(Camden, New Jersey, May 2, 1931 – St. Louis, Missouri, June 29, 1991) was an American jazz organist who performed in the hard bop and soul jazz genre. He is best known for his 1965 recording of \"Misty,\" and is considered a precursor of acid jazz.\\n\\nHolmes burst onto the music scene in the early 1960s (his first album, on Pacific Jazz with guest Ben Webster was recorded in March 1961). An African-American, literally a heavyweight (approximately 300 pounds) and physically rotund in stature, he gained immediate respect with an inimitable style of his own. His sound was immediately recognizable in the upper register, but even more so because of his virtuosity in creating, undoubtedly, the most rapid, punctuating, and pulsating basslines of all the jazz organists. His Prestige recording of \"Live at the Front Room\" recorded in Newark, New Jersey is one of the great jazz performances on the Hammond-B3. He (Holmes) seemed to make fire jump from the Hammond organ the night of that live recording. Though his recording years were relatively brief, as he died at the less than advanced age of 60, he established a recognition that is stellar within the community of notable jazz organ giants,i.e. Jimmy Smith (The Sermon), Brother Jack McDuff (A Real Good \\'Un), Jimmy McGriff (I\\'ve Got a Woman). His style whether ballad, standard, or uptempo straight ahead, was always soulful, as his nicknamed implied, he was a \"Groove\".\\n\\nHe recorded many albums for Pacific Jazz, Prestige Records, Groove Merchent and Muse Records.\\n\\nHolmes died after a long struggle with prostate cancer, having performed his last concerts on a wheelchair. One of his last gigs was at the 1991 Chicago Blues Festival with his longtime friend, singer Jimmy Witherspoon. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Richard+%22Groove%22+Holmes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'James Cecil Dickens (born December 19, 1920 - January 2, 2015), better known as Little Jimmy Dickens, is an American country music singer famous for his humorous novelty songs, his small size, 4\\'11\" (150 cm), and his rhinestone-studded outfits. He started as a member of the Grand Ole Opry in 1948 and became a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1983.\\n\\nBorn in Bolt, West Virginia, Dickens began his musical career in the late 1930s, performing on a local radio station while attending West Virginia University. He soon quit school to pursue a full-time music career, and travelled the country performing on various local radio stations under the name \"Jimmy the Kid.\"\\n\\nIn 1948, Dickens was heard performing on a radio station in Saginaw, Michigan by Roy Acuff, who introduced him to Art Satherly at Columbia Records and officials from the Grand Ole Opry. Dickens signed with Columbia in September and joined the Opry in August. Around this time he began using the nickname, Little Jimmy Dickens, inspired by his short stature.\\n\\nDickens recorded many novelty songs for Columbia, including \"Country Boy,\" \"A-Sleeping at the Foot of the Bed\" and \"I\\'m Little But I\\'m Loud.\" His song \"Take an Old Cold Tater (And Wait)\" inspired Hank Williams to nickname him \"Tater\". Later, telling Jimmy he needed a hit, Williams penned \"Hey Good Lookin\\'\" specifically for Dickens in only 20 minutes while on a Grand Ole Opry tour bus. A week later Williams cut the song himself, jokingly telling him, \"That song\\'s too good for you!\"\\nDickens in 1955.\\n\\nIn 1950 Dickens formed the Country Boys with musicians Jabbo Arrington, Grady Martin, Bob Moore and Thumbs Carllile and. It was during this time that he discovered future Hall of Famer Marty Robbins at a Phoenix, Arizona television station while on tour with Grand Ole Opry road show. In 1957 Dickens left the Grand Ole Opry to tour with the Philip Morris Country Music Show.\\n\\nIn 1962 Dickens scored his first top-10 country hit since 1954 with \"The Violet and the Rose\".\\n\\nIn 1964 Dickens became the first country artist to circle the globe while on tour, and also made numerous TV appearances including The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. In 1965 he released his biggest hit, \"May the Bird of Paradise Fly Up Your Nose,\" reaching No. 1 on the country chart and No. 15 on the pop chart.\\n\\nIn the late 1960s Dickens left Columbia for Decca Records, before moving again to United Artists in 1971. That same year he married his wife, Mona, and in 1975 he returned to the Grand Ole Opry. In 1983 Dickens was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.\\n\\nDickens joined producers Randall Franks and Alan Autry for the In the Heat of the Night cast CD “Christmas Time’s A Comin’” performing \"Jingle Bells\" with the cast on the CD released on Sonlite and MGM/UA for one of the most popular Christmas releases of 1991 and 1992 with Southern retailers.\\n\\nRecently Dickens has made appearances in a number of music videos by fellow country musician and West Virginia native Brad Paisley. He has also been featured on several of Paisley\\'s albums in bonus comedy tracks along with other Opry mainstays such as George Jones and Bill Anderson. They are collectively referred to as the Kung-Pao Buckaroos.\\n\\nWith the passing of Hank Locklin in March 2009, Dickens became the oldest living member of the Grand Ole Opry at the age of 90. He still makes regular appearances as a host at the Opry, often with the self-deprecating joke that he is also known as \"Willie Nelson after taxes.\" At the 2011 CMA Awards, Jimmy was dressed up as Justin Bieber, and made fun of Bieber\\'s recent paternity scandal. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Little+Jimmy+Dickens\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Alfred Matthew \"Weird Al\" Yankovic (born October 23, 1959 in Downey, California) is an American singer-songwriter, music producer, actor, comedian, satirist, accordion player and kazooist. Yankovic is known in particular for his humorous songs that make light of popular culture and that often parody specific songs by contemporary musical acts. Since his first-aired song parody in 1976, he has sold more than 12 million albums—more than any other comedy act in history—recorded more than 150 parody and original songs, and has performed more than 1,000 live shows.His works have earned him three Grammy Awards among nine nominations, four gold records, and six platinum records in the United States. Yankovic\\'s first top ten Billboard album (Straight Outta Lynwood) and single (\"White & Nerdy\") were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career.\\n\\nIn addition to recording his albums, Yankovic has written and starred in his own film, UHF, and his own television show, The Weird Al Show, and directed music videos for himself and other artists including Ben Folds, Hanson, the Black Crowes and The Presidents of the United States of America. He has also made guest appearances on many television shows, in addition to starring in his own Al TV specials.\\n\\nThough parodies earned him his fame, Yankovic has recorded a greater number of humorous songs with original tunes. Some of these pieces are pastiches (or style parodies), where he chooses a band\\'s entire body of work to emulate rather than any single hit, although Yankovic has many completely original pieces. Most of his albums include a medley which juxtaposes the choruses of various songs in a polka style to accordion music.\\n\\nDue to his popularity, he has been credited with several songs that are not actually his. A full list of every song he has ever actually done, including the live-only songs, can be found at the Al Songs website.  Similarly, a comprehensive list of songs incorrectly credited to him can be found at The Not Al Page.\\n\\nIn 2006, Al recorded the song \"You\\'re Pitiful\". However, while James Blunt gave his blessing for the parody of his song, \"You\\'re Beautiful\", Blunt\\'s label Atlantic Records was opposed to it. Though parodies are protected legally, the issue had become \"more of a political matter than a legal matter\", according to Al, so he decided to not put the song on his next album. Instead, he offered it as a free download from his site.\\n\\nHis latest album, \"Straight Outta Lynwood\", was released September 26th, 2006. Its first released single, \"Don\\'t Download This Song\", was made available as a free download on August 21, 2006. The animated video for the track and a link to downloadable MP3 is available at dontdownloadthissong.com. Among other tracks, the album includes parodies of Green Day, Usher, R. Kelly, and Chamillionaire. Chamillionaire\\'s \"Ridin\\' Dirty\" is parodied as \"White and Nerdy\", the second released single from the new album.  This single has thus far climbed as far as #9 on the Billboard Singles chart, eclipsing \"Eat It\" as Al\\'s highest charting single (which went as high as #12).\\n\\nOfficial Website: http://www.weirdal.com\\n\\n\\n\\nFactBox Info\\n\\nMembers\\n\\nAl Yankovic\\nJon \\'\\'Bermuda\\'\\' Schwartz\\nSteve Jay\\nJim West\\nRubén Valtierra\\n\\nFormer Members\\n\\nRick Derringer\\nRoss Noble\\nJoe Earley <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/%22Weird+Al%22+Yankovic\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Gloria Estefan (born Gloria María Fajardo, September 1, 1957, in Havana, Cuba) is a seven-time Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter, actress and social activist. Known as the \"Queen of Latin Pop\", she in the top 100 best-selling music artists with over 100 million albums sold worldwide, 31.5 million of those in the United States. Estefan is the most successful crossover performer in Latin music to date.\\n\\nBeginning her career in 1975 as lead vocalist for the then exclusively Spanish-language band, Miami Sound Machine, before crossing over to mainstream pop success with the international hit singles \"Dr. Beat\" (1984) and \"Conga\" (1986), Estefan emerged as one of the biggest new stars in the mid-\\'80s, predating the still nascent Latin pop explosion by a decade, and scoring a series of propulsive dance hits rooted in the rhythms of her native Cuba, before shifting her focus to softer, more ballad-oriented fare. \\n\\nBorn in Havana, Cuba, the young Gloria Fajardo was raised primarily in Miami, FL, after her father, a bodyguard of Cuban president Fulgencio Batista, was forced to flee the island following the 1959 coup helmed by Fidel Castro. In the fall of 1975, Fajardo and her cousin Merci Murciano auditioned for the Miami Latin Boys, a local wedding band headed by keyboardist Emilio Estefan. With their addition, the group was rechristened Miami Sound Machine and four years later, Fajardo and Estefan were wed. As Miami Sound Machine began composing their own original material, their fusion of pop, disco, and salsa earned a devoted local following, and in 1979 the group issued their first Spanish-language LP on CBS International. Despite a growing Hispanic fan base, they did not cross over to non-Latin audiences until \"Dr. Beat\" topped European dance charts in 1984. \\n\\nWith 1985\\'s Primitive Love, Miami Sound Machine recorded their first English-language effort, scoring three Top Ten pop hits in the U.S. alone with the infectious \"Conga\", \"Bad Boy\", and \"Words Get in the Way\". Following 1987\\'s triple-platinum Let It Loose, Estefan took top billing and the group changed its name to Gloria Estefan & The Miami Sound Machine in 1988, reeling off four Top Ten hits - \"Rhythm Is Gonna Get You\", \"Can\\'t Stay Away from You\", the chart-topping \"Anything for You\", and \"1-2-3\". 1989\\'s Cuts Both Ways was credited to Estefan alone and generated her second #1 hit, \"Don\\'t Wanna Lose You\". However, on March 20, 1990, while touring in support of the album, her bus was struck by a tractor trailer. Estefan suffered a broken vertebra that required extensive surgery and kept her off the road for over a year. Her husband Emilio and the couple\\'s son were injured in the crash as well, but all three recovered. Estefan resurfaced in 1991 with Into the Light, again topping the charts with \"Coming Out of the Dark\", a single inspired by her near-fatal accident. Two more cuts from the album, \"Can\\'t Forget You\" and \"Live for Loving You\", secured her foothold on the adult contemporary charts. \\n\\nWith 1993\\'s Mi Tierra, Estefan returned to her roots, recording her first Spanish-language record in nearly a decade and earning a Grammy Award for Best Tropical Latin Album; on the follow-up 1994 covers collection, Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, she also recalled her dance-pop origins with a rendition of the Vicki Sue Robinson disco classic, \"Turn the Beat Around\". Another all-Spanish effort, Abriendo Puertas (1995), earned her a Grammy as well, while Destiny featured \"Reach\", named the official theme of the 1996 Summer Olympics. As Latin pop made new commercial headway, thanks to the efforts of acts like Ricky Martin and Enrique Iglesias, Estefan reigned as the most successful crossover artist in Latin music history, with international record sales close to the 50 million mark. In 1999, she also made her feature film debut alongside Meryl Streep in Music of the Heart, recording the film\\'s title song as a duet with *NSYNC, and scoring both a massive pop hit and an Oscar nomination in the process. A new Spanish-language album, Alma Caribeña, followed in the spring of 2000. Several months later, Estefan was awarded a Grammy for Best Music Video for \"No Me Dehes de Querer\" at the inaugural annual Latin Grammy Awards. Her husband, Emilio, won for Producer of the Year. - Jason Ankeny, All Music Guide\\n\\nAppearances and tours\\nIn April 2004, Estefan appeared on the Fox Broadcasting Company’s program, American Idol, but declined an offer to be an official judge, saying she did not like to “judge” others. \\n\\nOn July 28, 2004, in a press conference hosted by Donald Trump at the Trump Tower, Estefan announced that her then-upcoming tour would be her final one. The Live and Re-Wrapped Summer/Fall 2004 Tour, her first tour in eight years was produced by Clear Channel Entertainment. The tour featured Estefan’s greatest hits, along with new material from Unwrapped. \\n\\nIn December 2006, Estefan appeared as a special guest singer on the UK talent show The X Factor. \\n\\nGloria\\'s 11th studio album,Miss Little Havana. The Miss Little Havana Songfacts says that the first nine tracks tells the tale of a young girl who hooks up with the wrong guy in Miami after moving there from Cuba. All of these tracks were written or co-written by Pharrell Williams of The Neptunes. It is described by Estefan as a project in the vein of her 1998 hit album gloria!. \\n\\nSongfacts reports that \"Hotel Nacional\" debuted at #1 on Billboard\\'s Latin countdown - the first time a female artist had achieved that feat since the chart was introduced in 1986. Both \"Wepa\" and \"Hotel Nacional\" achieved number one on Billboard Latin Songs and on Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs. \\n\\nEstefan started a reality show called The Next: Fame Is at Your Doorstep opposite Joe Jonas, Nelly and John Rich on the CW Network, where she, and the other three mentors are searched for the next big star, to record an album with Atlantic Records. Unlike other music reality shows, in this program, the mentors selected the \"candidates\" for the show, and trained them for a live performance, where they\\'d be voted for the best act of the day. The first season ended in October 2012, with musician Michael Ray, as the big finalist.\\n\\nThis same year, Estefan appeared as a musical guest in Tony Bennett\\'s compilation of duets with Latin-American musicians, Viva Duets with a rendition of the song, \"Who Can I Turn To (When Nobody Needs Me)\". Weeks later, she helped the American version of Teleton, releasing the charity single \"Por Un Mundo Mejor\" along with Mexican singer Lucero, Dominican rapper El Cata and Mexican pop band, Reik. A video for the song was shot, with them recording the song, which was marked as the official hymn for the foundation.\\n\\nIn May 2013, she appears doing another duet with the song \"Think I\\'m In Love Again\" as part of the albums Duets released by Paul Anka.\\n\\nEstefan has announced she was working on a new album of covers, The Standards, released in September 2013. The album will feature some collaborations with artists like Laura Pausini, Dave Koz and Joshua Bell, and the selection of songs are mostly songs from the Great American songbook. Estefan released the first single, \"How Long Has This Been Going On?\", digitally on Amazon and iTunes on July 9, 2013\\n\\n\\nOfficial website: http://www.gloriaestefan.com\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Gloria+Estefan\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Robert Dwayne Womack (born in Cleveland, Ohio, USA on March 4, 1944, died June 27, 2014), was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. Working in the soul and R&B genres, he achieved his greatest success in the 1970s and 1980s. Womack wrote and originally recorded The Rolling Stones\\' first UK No. 1 hit, \"It\\'s All Over Now\" and New Birth\\'s \"I Can Understand It\" among other songs. As a singer he is most notable for the hits \"Lookin\\' For a Love\", \"That\\'s The Way I Feel About Cha\", \"Woman\\'s Gotta Have It\", \"Harry Hippie\", \"Across 110th Street\" and his 1980s hit \"If You Think You\\'re Lonely Now\". In 2009, Womack was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\\n\\nTaking after their father, who sang gospel music, Bobby Womack and his brothers formed their own group in 1952. In 1954, under the moniker Curtis Womack and the Womack Brothers, the group issued the Pennant single, \"Buffalo Bill\". Bobby Womack was only ten years old at the time. Sam Cooke took an interest in the Womack Brothers, and they recorded for Cooke\\'s SAR record label in the early 1960s. Renamed the Valentinos, and encouraged by Cooke to go in a more secular and commercial direction, they scored a hit with Womack\\'s \"It\\'s All Over Now\" in 1964; the Rolling Stones\\' version of the song became a major hit, earning Womack generous royalty payments.\\n\\nSam Cooke died in late 1964; Womack married Cooke\\'s widow, Barbara, a short time later, creating something of a scandal. Things became even more complicated when his younger brother, Cecil, married Cooke\\'s daughter, Linda. As a session guitarist, Womack worked at producer Chips Moman\\'s American Studios in Memphis, and played on recordings by Joe Tex and The Box Tops. Until this point, around 1967, he had had little success as a solo artist, but at American he began to record a string of classic soul-music singles including the 1968 \"What Is This\" (his first chart hit), \"It\\'s Gonna Rain\" and \"More Than I Can Stand,\" all of which featured his elegant, understated rhythm-guitar work and his impassioned vocals. During this period he became known as a songwriter, contributing many songs to the repertoire of Wilson Pickett; these include \"I\\'m in Love\" and \"I\\'m a Midnight Mover.\"\\n\\nAfter moving to the United Artists label in the early \\'70s, he released the album Communication, and on an album with guitarist Gabor Szabo introduced his song \"Breezin\\',\" which later became a hit for George Benson. He also became known for his interesting taste in cover versions, essaying Fred Neil\\'s \"Everybody\\'s Talkin\\' \" as well as \"Fly Me to the Moon (In Other Words)\" and James Taylor\\'s \"Fire and Rain\\'\" and \"California Dreamin\\'.\" Perhaps his most well-known work from this period is as guitarist on Sly & the Family Stone\\'s 1971 There\\'s a Riot Goin\\' On.\\n\\nHe continued to have hits into the \\'70s; these include \"Lookin\\' for a Love\" (a remake of his 1962 Valentinos single), \"Across 110th Street,\" \"Woman\\'s Gotta Have It\" (covered by James Taylor in 1976), \"You\\'re Welcome, Stop on By,\" and the masterful \"Daylight.\" All are excellent examples of burnished yet gritty 1970s soul music, and reveal a pop-music sensibility akin to that of Marvin Gaye or Curtis Mayfield.\\n\\nBobby Womack\\'s 1981 album The Poet was a surprise hit and contained the hit single \"If You Think You\\'re Lonely Now.\" K-Ci Hailey, a notable admirer of Womack\\'s work, covered \"If You Think You\\'re Lonely Now\" in 1994. The song is referenced in Mariah Carey\\'s song \"We Belong Together\", a number-one hit in June 2005. Carey sings \"I can\\'t sleep at night /When you are on my mind / Bobby Womack\\'s on the radio / Singing to me: \\'If you think you\\'re lonely now.\\'\"\\n\\nFilm director Quentin Tarantino used \"Across 110th Street\" (which, in a different version, had been the title song of the 1972 movie) in the opening and closing sequences of his 1997 film Jackie Brown.\\n\\nA 2003 Saab commercial shone a spotlight on Womack’s interpretation of \"California Dreamin\\'\".\\n\\nIn 2010, Womack contributed lyrics and sang on \"Stylo\" alongside Mos Def, the first single from the third Gorillaz album, Plastic Beach. Womack was told to sing whatever was on his mind during the recording of \"Stylo\". \"I was in there for an hour going crazy about love and politics, getting it off my chest\", said Womack.[4] He also provides vocals on the song \"Cloud of Unknowing\".\\n\\nIn 2010 Bobby Womack appeared on the main pyramid stage at Glastonbury with the Gorillaz.\\n\\nThe Bravest Man in the World Songfacts reports in 2012, Womack\\'s first album of original material since 1994\\'s Resurrection was released. The Bravest Man in the World was produced by Damon Albarn of Gorillaz and XL Recordings boss, Richard Russell.\\n\\nWomack died on June 27, 2014 at age 70. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bobby+Womack\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Cameron Jibril Thomaz (born September 8, 1987 in Minot, North Dakota), better known by his stage name Wiz Khalifa, is an American rapper based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, signed to Rostrum Records. According to the Black and Yellow Songfacts, his stage name is derived from khalifa, an Arabic word meaning \"successor\", and wisdom. His nickname growing up was \"Wizard\" which was shortened to Wiz when Khalifa was fifteen.\\n\\nIn 2005 he released his first official mixtape, Prince of the City: Welcome to Pistolvania, and later in 2006 he released his first full length street album entitled Show and Prove. Since then he has released a further six mixtapes and a collaboration mixtape titled How Fly with friend Curren$y. He released his debut album, Deal or No Deal, in November of 2009, it reached #1 on the iTunes hip hop chart, and then reached the top ten on iTunes\\' overall album chart the week it was released. Previously signed to Warner Bros. Records, he left the label in July 2009 after numerous delays in releasing his planned debut album for the label, First Flight. Khalifa stated to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that, \"I learned a lot during my time there and matured as an artist during the process. I\\'m happy to be moving on with all of my material and having the chance to be in control of my next moves\".He is also the founder of the rap crew Taylor Gang, which includes friends Kev Tha Hustler, Ekko, Smallz Money and Gene Stovall. They derived the name from the fact they always used to wear Chuck Taylor shoes.\\n\\nKhalifa was born on September 8, 1987 in Minot, North Dakota to a mother and a father serving in the military. The family moved to Pittsburgh when Khalifa was the age of two. His parents\\' military service caused the family to move on a regular basis. \\nOver the next thirteen years, he would move between Pittsburgh and South Carolina, Georgia, Oklahoma, Germany, Japan, and England as his parents were reassigned to different posts. In October of 1990 Wiz was separated from his mother,who left him in the hands of her sister while she served in Operation Desert Storm.\\n\\nDuring his travels, Wiz was forced to mature quicker than his peers. He was constantly faced with new surroundings, new schools, and new sets of friends, and he found it difficult to become attached to anyone outside his family roots. This nomadic life gave Wiz an opportunity, though, to broaden his mind and offered him many experiences from which to draw inspiration. He began to perceive the world differently than most kids, and he would write his thoughts down every day.These thoughts would become the foundation for his future recordings.\\n\\nBy the age of 14, with a few songs under his belt, Wiz was already drawing comparisons with his commanding voice and witty wordplay. While he has been influenced by artists such as Jay-Z, Camron, and the Notorious B.I.G., Wiz was determined to create his own identity that would, one day, be loved and revered by fans.\\n\\nReady to take the next step, Wiz began his search for a recording studio to record new songs. He found one, ID LABS, where owner Eric Dan immediately recognized Wiz\\'s talents. Along with Chad Glick of ID Management, they began to network Wiz to another Pittsburgh native, Benjy Grinberg of Rostrum Records. Benjy realized the raw talent that Wiz possessed, and immediately brought him into the Rostrum family in 2002.\\n\\nSoon after, Wiz Khalifa began his ascent into the music scene in the Pittsburgh area. He has been hailed by the award winning Pittsburgh Post-Gazette pop music critic, Ed Masley, as having “the skills, the looks, the confidence, the drive, and the charisma for the job.” The New Pittsburgh Courier says, “The combination of a young, charismatic M.C. with a slew of stop-and-rewind rhymes together with a local independent label with major industry connections has set the stage for a hip-hop artist representing Pittsburgh to reach superstar status for the first time ever.\\n\\nIn 2010, with the success of Kush and Orange Juice still present, Wiz Khalifa signed with Atlantic Records. Wiz\\'s style along with his production team, Johnny Juliano, Sledgren, and E. Dan make this a winning combination for success. \\n\\nHe is also well known for his debut single for Atlantic, \"Black and Yellow\", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. His debut album for the label, Rolling Papers, was released on March 29, 2011. He followed that album with O.N.I.F.C. (abbreviated for mainstream markets from \"Only Nigga In First Class\") on December 4, 2012 which was backed by the singles \"Work Hard, Play Hard\" and \"Remember You\". O.N.I.F.C. debuted at number two with 131,000 in first week sales.\\n\\nPittsburgh City Council declared 12-12-12 (December 12, 2012) to be Wiz Khalifa Day in the city. Khalifa graduated from Pittsburgh\\'s Taylor Allderdice High School and in January 2012, purchased a home in nearby Canonsburg, Pennsylvania.\\n\\nIn April 2013, Khalifa revealed that after having his son he decided to work on a new album that he was planning to release in 2013. On April 17, 2013, Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y announced that they will drop their collaboration EP Live in Concert on April 20, 2013. The EP featured seven new songs. On June 24, 2013, he announced that his fifth studio album would be titled Blacc Hollywood and would be released in 2013. On September 3, 2013, Khalifa revealed he had recorded songs with Miley Cyrus, Adele and Juicy J for Blacc Hollywood. In October 2013, Mannie Fresh confirmed that he provided production for the album. On February 11, 2014, Khalifa released Blacc Hollywood\\'s first single titled \"We Dem Boyz\". The album was then supported by the singles \"KK\", \"You and Your Friends\", \"Stayin Out All Night\", \"Promises\" and \"So High\". \\n\\nKhalifa released an EP with TY Dolla $ign on March 31, 2015, entitled \"Talk About It In the Morning\". That same month, Wiz released the lead single for the film \"Furious 7\" called \"See You Again\" as a tribute to Paul Walker. The single has since gone on to global success. \"See You Again\" spent 12 non-consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, tying for the longest-running rap number-one hit in the US. \\n\\nOn January 23, 2015, Khalifa was featured on a remix release of the Fall Out Boy song \"Uma Thurman\". On May 18, they performed the song together on the 2015 Billboard Music Awards show.

       " 'Radric Davis (born February 12, 1980 in Birmingham, Alabama), better known by his stage name Gucci Mane, is an American rapper and CEO of 1017 Brick Squad Records. In 2005 he released his independent debut album, Trap House, which featured the successful single \"Icy\" that he recorded with Young Jeezy. He has since released a further three albums including 2006\\'s Hard To Kill, 2007\\'s Trap-A-Thon and 2007\\'s Back To The Trap House. His sixth studio album, The State vs Radric Davis, was released in December 2009, just weeks after he was sent back to prison for 12 months for violating his probation. He was released in May 2010 and will now release his seventh studio album, The Appeal: Georgia\\'s Most Wanted, sometime at the end of 2010.\\n\\nIt’s said that art mirrors life. In hip-hop’s case, there’s always been a deliberate entanglement of perception and reality. Fans demand their MCs be real…but never too real. Successful hip-hop is about the hint of the danger, the tease of it, the mystique. Hip-hop is about balance.\\n\\nGucci Mane is an artist striving for that balance, volatility versus musicality. Controversy, including a feud with former collaborator Young Jeezy, has grabbed the headlines, with insufficient regard paid to his considerable mic skills, raw talent, and business acumen. Gucci is looking to wrest his name from public speculation and let his own words do the talking.\\n\\n“I wish everybody well who’s making money in this rap game,” the Atlanta-raised rapper says, dismissing the controversy that followed him in the past. “My own rap game is going so good, I’ve got so many things on my plate at my label, that I don’t got time for other people’s business.” With a deal with Asylum Records as the boss of his own label, So Icey Entertainment, Gucci does indeed have a full schedule with no time to dwell on the past.\\n\\n“I live my life with no regrets. I just wish that a lot of things never happened, but anybody can wish,” says Gucci. Sounds like a man with his eyes on the prize. And you’d expect nothing less from an artist who ground his way to the top via the hustle of independent records. Signing to Big Cat Records in the wake of his local single “Black Tee,” he dropped his debut record, Trap House, in May 2005. The independent album moved an impressive 140,000 units, largely on the strength of the “Icy” single, featuring Jeezy. Clamor over song rights sparked dispute, and the resulting rift grew.\\n\\nControversy notwithstanding, Mane’s independence was cemented: “I was on the independent scene for about two years,” he recalls. “It’s crazy! You gotta go into your own pocket to support your craft. You need other avenues to have money coming in, to support your stuff. You might win, you might lose, and it’s a gamble out there with the independent circuit. One thing you’d better have is good music because without that, you go downhill fast in the independent game.”\\n\\nGood music firmly in hand, Gucci was fast approaching stardom when more tragedy befell him. But let’s backtrack; how did the man born Radric Davis in Bessemer, Alabama, become Gucci Mane, mouthpiece for Atlanta stuntin’? Mane remembers little from his time in Alabama, just that it was rural, and that it’s changed dramatically since he left at the age of nine. “I gotta shout out Alabama though, because they holdin’ it down,” he affirms. “Every time I go there to do a show, I’m impressed with how hip-hop culture has taken root.”\\n\\nMane’s identity coalesced when he moved with his mother to Atlanta. “I lived all of my adolescent and adult life in Atlanta,” he explains. “I’m from East Atlanta Zone Six; it was hard, man, it was real rough. I grew up in the Starter jacket era: they’d take your Starter jacket, your 8Ball jacket, they’d take your hat, your shoes. It was just no holds barred on the streets, dog eat dog. If you missed the bus, you had to be crewed up or you’d get jumped. It was wild when I came up.”\\n\\nIt’s a bleak portrait. When asked to describe his home life more vividly, Mane offers a look into his contemplative side, a side honed as a schoolyard poet. “I was just a young dude in a single parent house most of my life. I can’t complain that much. I would guess it’s like any black child growing up in a single parent household. There are a lot of people who know how that is. I didn’t have a lot coming up; but what I did have, I appreciated. I was blessed to have a caring mother to raise me right and to help me with my business ventures; she’s been there through the whole struggle. There’s a lot that goes along with that; it made me who I am today.”\\n\\nA stepfather would enter the picture during Mane’s adolescence, introducing not only a male figure, but also inspiration for Mane’s unusual moniker. “My father came in, the original Gucci Mane; that’s what people in the neighborhood called him, and that’s where I get my name from. From then on, I grew up the son of a hustler and a schoolteacher; it was the best of both worlds because I was educated twice.” Drawing inspiration from a pantheon of rappers before him –Big Daddy Kane, LL Cool J, Ice Cube, the Beastie Boys, N.W.A—Mane went on to release Trap House, a lethal brew of his signature sound: “I call my music straight Gucci: going hard and whatever beats you make you for me, if I’m feeling it, if I’m rocking with it, I’m gonna crush it. When you hear me, you hear a lot of pain, a lot of hood; you hear what’s going on in the inner city in Atlanta.”\\n\\nUnfortunately, Trap House was ill timed; the month of its release, Gucci was accused of murder and jailed for two days. Eventually deemed to be acting in self-defense, and without sufficient evidence to hold him, Mane was exonerated. But the ordeal left an indelible imprint on the man. “I learned to keep better company, watch where I go, and be mindful of my surroundings at all times,” he reveals. “Watch what I say, watch what I do and how I do it, just keep myself out of the wrong crowd.”\\n\\n“I always stand up man,” he continues. “I’m one of the toughest guys I know. It’ll take a lot more than that to break me down.” Undeterred, Mane was back in the studio, preparing 2006’s eerily apropos Hard To Kill. The buzz from Hard To Kill vaulted Gucci Mane from regional commodity to national treasure, and major labels responded accordingly: “There was a bidding war going on, and I liked Atlantic’s approach. They made it known that they wanted me, they felt where I was going and that I could grow with them.”\\n\\nAsylum/Atlantic Records welcomed Gucci Mane in early ’07, granting him his own imprint, So Icey Entertainment. With it comes an entire stable of artists, the So Icey Boyz. As the Boyz ready for their own exposure –“I got them in training; they be in the weight room, pumping iron, doing pushups, shopping at the mall, buying ice”—Gucci is focused on his magnum opus, Back to the Trap House. “I started working on the album, and by the third song, I was like ‘This is going back to the Trap House.’ I started feeling the same way I did when I made my first album. It had the same feel to it, the same freshness. And I had the same hunger and desire I had when I first started rapping.”\\n\\n“Since I went major, I want everybody to know I’m still keeping it street, keeping it hood,” Gucci maintains. “I’m trying to take it back to all my fans that I had when I first started my career. And at the same time, I’m trying to open up my new album to a new fan base. So it’s a mix for everybody coming together, like my first album was.” Gucci has always prided himself on his innate ability, and his refusal to let guest appearances dictate the tone of his records. “I just want people to know I’m a great songwriter, man,” he asserts. “I’m passionate about what I do, and it’s choreographed strategically when I do it. I bring a lot of experience, creative wordplay, and a crazy style. And my albums, I record most of the songs without writing them down; it’s a God-given gift and I just get paid for it. It come from God, it’s like wondering what makes a bird fly. He made me a poet like the great poets of the past.”\\n\\nBut don’t mistake Gucci’s confidence for self-absorption. The vicissitudes of his career have dictated a longer view. Lyrics aside, he’s less preoccupied with visible means and more so with acting as an emissary from his under-repped block. “I’m not the one to glorify what goes on in the hood,” he insists. “We have everything there, the whole range from violence to people getting on the bus and going to work. There’s a lot more to the hood than just drugs. It’s a bigger story, there’s a big picture. I went to school in that neighborhood, I worked there, I trapped there, I hustled there, and I got my name there. I’m proud to be from East Atlanta Zone Six, and I claim there. I hold that on my back and carry that, to be the first one from there to really rock.”\\n\\nAnd Gucci’s professional aims have matured as well. While other rappers stress platinum plaques, Gucci hasn’t forgotten the route he took to stardom. “I made a lot of CDs on my own. People fucked with me and supported me, and just made me the man I am today. That’s my blueprint right there, and I stay mindful of it. So now, my only concern is that people feel my music; at the end of the day, I do it for people to feel it. If one person feel it, two people feel it, I feel like my job’s been done.”\\n\\nFortunately for Gucci, he should be prepared to welcome an army of new fans with Back to the Trap House. But longstanding fans shouldn’t fear; they’ll recognize “Freaky Gurl,” reprised from its previous appearance from Hard To Kill. Luda, upon hearing the joint, asked for a guest spot on the remix. Said remix now appears as the lead single on Back to the Trap House, following in Gucci’s theme of mating old and new. Over a bouncing, meandering beat from Cyber Sapp, the two cook up the requisite concoction of whips, chips, and chicks. Also look out for “Bird Flu,” the album’s number two single, laced by New-York based Supa Sonics. Elsewhere, firm guest verses from Rich Boy and Pimp C of UGK round out Gucci’s regional flavor, while Bay-area producer Zaytoven (of “Icy” renown) locks down Gucci’s West Coast appeal.\\n\\nGucci Mane has something for everyone, and with the struggles of the past in his rearview, Gucci is settled in for his ride to the top. “I’m best known for controversy but I’m trying to gain respect as a songwriter and entertainer. I plan to hit them so hard with this album; who knows what the future will bring. I’ll be banging them out till I can’t bang no more.”\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Gucci+Mane\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Tyler Gregory Okonma (born March 6, 1991) also known as Tyler, The Creator, is a Grammy award-winning American rapper, singer, record producer, director, fashion designer, and the head of his independent record label, Odd Future Records. He was the leader of the now-defunct Los Angeles, California, USA hip-hop collective Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All (OFWGKTA). Since his first recordings had debuted on The Odd Future Tape in 2007, he had rapped on, and produced for, nearly every OFWGKTA release. \\n\\nTyler, The Creator is Okonma\\'s most commonly used alias, and the one that both of his first two albums are credited to, but he has used several others as well, including Wolf Haley, Ace (or Ace Creator), and Young N***a, the latter of which was part of a prank on OFWGKTA\\'s official site.  Many other characters or alter egos and names are featured in his music, such as Tron Cat, a therapist called Dr. TC, and most recently, Tyler Baudelaire, the character from the 2021 album CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST.\\n\\nIn 2009, Tyler self-released his debut mixtape B*stard as a free download off of the official OFWGKTA website.  Two music videos were released for tracks off of B*stard, \"VCR\" and \"French!,\" both of which were directed by Tyler (credited as Wolf Haley).  The album is focused on dialogues between Tyler and Dr. TC, and it received generally positive reviews from critics and blogs alike.\\n\\nAfter signing to XL Recordings in February 2011, he released \"Yonkers,\" the lead single off his sophomoric album Goblin, which was released on May 10, 2011. The music video for \"Yonkers\" (directed by Tyler credited as Wolf Haley) won Tyler The 2011 MTV Video Music Award for \"Best New Artist,\" as well as a nomination for Video of the Year (which lost to Katy Perry\\'s \"Firework\").  \\n\\nGoblin, an album described as \"dark,\" \"monolithic,\" and \"a natural sequel to B*stard,\" continues the sessions with Tyler\\'s fictional therapist, with Tyler venting to Dr. TC about fame, message boards, critics, hype, expectations, media scrutiny, and the idea of being a role model.  All of the production was handled by Tyler, save for \"Transylvania,\" which was produced by fellow OFWGKTA member Left Brain.\\n\\nTyler\\'s third studio album, known as Wolf,  was released in 2013.  Tyler alluded to several possible track names on his Formspring account, and he stated that the album would focus less on rapping and more on production.  In an interview with DJ Semtex, he confirmed that he would handle all the production on the album, except for one song produced by Left Brain, the same approach that was used for Goblin.  On February 14, 2013, OFWGKTA uploaded a video to their YouTube account, which included L-Boy skydiving and stating that on April 2, 2013. Tyler revealed three album covers via his Instagram. The first single from the album was released on February 14, 2013, titled \" Domo 23\" along with the music video which features cameos from Domo Genesis, Earl Sweatshirt, Jasper Dolphin and Taco Bennett. On February 26, 2013, Tyler performed the songs \"Domo23\" and \"Treehome95\" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tyler,+the+Creator\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Tupac Amaru Shakur (born Lesane Parish Crooks, June 16, 1971 – September 13, 1996), better known by his stage name 2Pac and later by his alias Makaveli, was an American rapper and actor. Considered one of the most influential rappers of all time, Shakur is among the best-selling music artists, having sold more than 75 million records worldwide. Much of Shakur\\'s music has been noted for addressing contemporary social issues that plagued inner cities, and he is considered a symbol of activism against inequality.\\n\\nShakur was born in New York City to parents who were both political activists and Black Panther Party members. Raised by his mother, he relocated to Baltimore in 1984 and to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1988. With the release of his debut album 2Pacalypse Now in 1991, he became a central figure in West Coast hip-hop for his conscious rap lyrics. Shakur achieved further critical and commercial success with his follow-up albums Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z... (1993) and Me Against the World (1995). His Diamond certified album All Eyez on Me (1996), the first double-length album in hip-hop history, abandoned his introspective lyrics for volatile gangsta rap. In addition to his music career, Shakur also found considerable success as an actor, with his starring roles in Juice (1992), Poetic Justice (1993), Above the Rim (1994), Bullet (1996), Gridlock\\'d (1997), and Gang Related (1997).\\n\\nDuring the later part of his career, Shakur was shot five times in the lobby of a New York recording studio and experienced legal troubles, including incarceration. In 1995, Shakur served eight months in prison on sexual abuse charges, but was released pending an appeal of his conviction. Following his release, he signed to Marion \"Suge\" Knight\\'s label Death Row Records and became heavily involved in the growing East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry. On September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot four times by an unidentified assailant in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas; he died six days later. Following his murder, Shakur\\'s friend-turned-rival, the Notorious B.I.G., was at first considered a suspect due to their public feud, but was also murdered in another drive-by shooting six months later in March 1997 while visiting Los Angeles.\\n\\nFive more albums have been released since Shakur\\'s death, all of which have been certified Platinum in the United States. In 2002, Shakur was inducted into the Hip-Hop Hall of Fame. In 2017, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. Rolling Stone magazine ranked Shakur among the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\\n\\nShakur was born on June 16, 1971, in the East Harlem section of Manhattan in New York City. While born Lesane Parish Crooks, at age one he was renamed Tupac Amaru Shakur. He was named after Túpac Amaru II, the descendant of the last Incan ruler, Túpac Amaru, who was executed in Peru in 1781 after his failed revolt against Spanish rule.  Shakur\\'s mother explained, \"I wanted him to have the name of revolutionary, indigenous people in the world. I wanted him to know he was part of a world culture and not just from a neighborhood.\"\\n\\nShakur had an older stepbrother, Mopreme \"Komani\" Shakur, and a half-sister, Sekyiwa Shakur, two years his junior. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/2Pac\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Christopher George Latore Wallace (May 21, 1972 – March 9, 1997), known professionally as The Notorious B.I.G., Biggie Smalls, or Biggie, was an American rapper. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time.\\n\\nWallace was born and raised in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. His debut album Ready to Die (1994) made him a central figure in East Coast hip hop and increased New York City\\'s visibility in the genre at a time when West Coast hip hop dominated the mainstream. The following year, he led Junior M.A.F.I.A.—a protégé group composed of his childhood friends—to chart success. In 1996, while recording his second album, Wallace was heavily involved in the growing East Coast–West Coast hip hop feud. On March 9, 1997, he was murdered by an unknown assailant in a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles. His second album, Life After Death (1997), released two weeks later, rose to No. 1 on the U.S. album charts. In 2000, it became one of the few hip-hop albums to be certified Diamond.\\n\\nWallace was noted for his \"loose, easy flow\"; dark, semi-autobiographical lyrics; and storytelling abilities, which focused on crime and hardship. Three more albums have been released since his death, and he has certified sales of over 17 million records in the United States, including 13.4 million albums.\\n\\nWallace was born at St. Mary\\'s Hospital in the Brooklyn borough of New York City on May 21, 1972, the only child of Jamaican immigrant parents. His mother, Voletta Wallace, was a preschool teacher, while his father, Selwyn George Latore, was a welder and politician. His father left the family when Wallace was two years old, and his mother worked two jobs while raising him. Wallace grew up at 226 St. James Place in Brooklyn\\'s Clinton Hill, near the border with Bedford-Stuyvesant. Wallace excelled at Queen of All Saints Middle School winning several awards as an English student. He was nicknamed \"Big\" because he was overweight by the age of 10. Wallace said he started dealing drugs when he was around the age of 12. His mother, often away at work, did not know of his drug dealing until he was an adult. He began rapping as a teenager, entertaining people on the streets, and performed with local groups the Old Gold Brothers and the Techniques. At his request, Wallace transferred from Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School to George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School, where future rappers DMX, Jay-Z, and Busta Rhymes were also attending. According to his mother, Wallace was still a good student but developed a \"smart-ass\" attitude at the new school. At age 17, Wallace dropped out of school and became more involved in crime. In 1989, he was arrested on weapons charges in Brooklyn and sentenced to five years\\' probation. In 1990, he was arrested on a violation of his probation. A year later, Wallace was arrested in North Carolina for dealing crack cocaine. He spent nine months in jail before making bail.\\n\\nWallace\\'s lyrical topics and themes included mafioso tales (\"Niggas Bleed\"), his drug-dealing past (\"10 Crack Commandments\"), materialistic bragging (\"Hypnotize\"), as well as humor (\"Just Playing (Dreams)\"), and romance (\"Me & My Bitch\"). Rolling Stone named Wallace in 2004 as \"one of the few young male songwriters in any pop style writing credible love songs\".\\n\\nGuerilla Black, in the book How to Rap, describes how Wallace was able to both \"glorify the upper echelon\" and \"[make] you feel his struggle\". According to Touré of The New York Times in 1994, Wallace\\'s lyrics \" autobiographical details about crime and violence with emotional honesty\". Marriott of The New York Times (in 1997) believed his lyrics were not strictly autobiographical and wrote he \"had a knack for exaggeration that increased sales\". Wallace described his debut as \"a big pie, with each slice indicating a different point in my life involving bitches and niggaz... from the beginning to the end\".\\n\\nReady to Die is described by Rolling Stone as a contrast of \"bleak\" street visions and being \"full of high-spirited fun, bringing the pleasure principle back to hip-hop\". AllMusic write of \"a sense of doom\" in some of his songs and the NY Times note some being \"laced with paranoia\"; Wallace described himself as feeling \"broke and depressed\" when he made his debut. The final song on the album, \"Suicidal Thoughts\", featured Wallace contemplating suicide and concluded with him committing the act.\\n\\nOn Life After Death, Wallace\\'s lyrics went \"deeper\". Krims explains how upbeat, dance-oriented tracks (which featured less heavily on his debut) alternate with \"reality rap\" songs on the record and suggests that he was \"going pimp\" through some of the lyrical topics of the former. XXL magazine wrote that Wallace \"revamped his image\" through the portrayal of himself between the albums, going from \"midlevel hustler\" on his debut to \"drug lord\".\\n\\nAllMusic wrote that the success of Ready to Die is \"mostly due to Wallace\\'s skill as a storyteller\"; in 1994, Rolling Stone described Wallace\\'s ability in this technique as painting \"a sonic picture so vibrant that you\\'re transported right to the scene\". On Life After Death, Wallace notably demonstrated this skill on \"I Got a Story to Tell\", creating a story as a rap for the first half of the song and then retelling the same story \"for his boys\" in conversation form.\\n\\nConsidered one of the best rappers of all time, Wallace was described by AllMusic as \"the savior of East Coast hip-hop\". The Source magazine named Wallace the greatest rapper of all time in its 150th issue in 2002. In 2003, when XXL magazine asked several hip hop artists to list their five favorite MCs, Wallace\\'s name appeared on more rappers\\' lists than anyone else. In 2006, MTV ranked him at No. 3 on their list of The Greatest MCs of All Time, calling him possibly \"the most skillful ever on the mic\". Editors of About.com ranked him No. 3 on their list of the Top 50 MCs of Our Time (1987–2007). In 2012, The Source ranked him No. 3 on their list of the Top 50 Lyrical Leaders of all time. Rolling Stone has referred to him as the \"greatest rapper that ever lived\". In 2015, Billboard named Wallace as the greatest rapper of all time.\\n\\nSince his death, Wallace\\'s lyrics have been sampled and quoted by a variety of hip hop, R&B and pop artists including Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Alicia Keys, Fat Joe, Nelly, Ja Rule, Eminem, Lil Wayne, Game, Clinton Sparks, Michael Jackson and Usher. On August 28, 2005, at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, Sean Combs (then using the rap alias \"P. Diddy\") and Snoop Dogg paid tribute to Wallace: an orchestra played while the vocals from \"Juicy\" and \"Warning\" played on the arena speakers. In September 2005, VH1 held its second annual \"Hip Hop Honors\", with a tribute to Wallace headlining the show.\\n\\nWallace had begun to promote a clothing line called Brooklyn Mint, which was to produce plus-sized clothing but fell dormant after he died. In 2004, his managers, Mark Pitts and Wayne Barrow, launched the clothing line, with help from Jay-Z, selling T-shirts with images of Wallace on them. A portion of the proceeds go to the Christopher Wallace Foundation and to Jay-Z\\'s Shawn Carter Scholarship Foundation. In 2005, Voletta Wallace hired branding and licensing agency Wicked Cow Entertainment to guide the estate\\'s licensing efforts. Wallace-branded products on the market include action figures, blankets, and cell phone content.\\n\\nThe Christopher Wallace Memorial Foundation holds an annual black-tie dinner (\"B.I.G. Night Out\") to raise funds for children\\'s school equipment and to honor Wallace\\'s memory. For this particular event, because it is a children\\'s schools\\' charity, \"B.I.G.\" is also said to stand for \"Books Instead of Guns\".\\n\\nThere is a large portrait mural of Wallace as Mao Zedong on Fulton Street in Brooklyn a half-mile west from Wallace\\'s old block. A fan petitioned to have the corner of Fulton Street and St. James Place, near Wallace\\'s childhood home renamed in his honor, garnering support from local businesses and attracting more than 560 signatures.\\n\\nA large portrait of Wallace features prominently in the Netflix series Luke Cage, due to the fact that he served as muse for the creation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\\'s version of Marvel Comics character Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Notorious+B.I.G.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Curtis James Jackson III (born July 6, 1975 in South Jamaica, Queens, New York), better known by his stage name 50 Cent, is a Grammy award nominated rapper, actor, singer, entrepreneur, author and founder of the hip hop group and label G-Unit. \\n\\nJackson was born and raised in South Jamaica, a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens. His mother Sabrina, a drug dealer, died in a fire when he was 8. Since his father had already abandoned the family, young Curtis was sent to live with his grandparents. Growing up during the crack epidemic of the 80s and 90s, Jackson dealt drugs when he wasn\\'t \"killing time\" at school or boxing at a local gym. His grandparents assumed he was at after-school programs when he was out selling crack. In tenth grade, Jackson was caught with guns and drug money passing through the metal detectors at Andrew Jackson High School in Queens. In 1994, Jackson was arrested again for selling vials of cocaine to an undercover officer, and three weeks later he was arrested yet-again after police found heroin, crack cocaine, and a starter pistol in his home. Jackson was sentenced to 3 to 9 years in prison, but opted to join a 6 month boot camp program and get his GED. Around this time, Jackson began going by \"50 Cent,\" inspired by deceased Brooklyn stick-up man Kelvin \"50 Cent\" Martin. \\n\\nAfter leaving drug dealing to pursue a rap career, he released his debut album Guess Who\\'s Back Again in 2002. He was discovered by Eminem and Dr. Dre and then signed to Interscope Records. He has since released Get Rich or Die Tryin\\' (2003), The Massacre (2006), Curtis (2007) and Before I Self Destruct (2009).\\n\\n50 Cent has engaged in feuds with other rappers including Jay-Z, Ja Rule, The Game, Cam\\'ron, Fat Joe, and Rick Ross. He has also pursued an acting career, appearing in the semi-autobiographical film Get Rich or Die Tryin\\' in 2005, the Iraq War film Home of the Brave in 2006, and Righteous Kill in 2008. 50 Cent is one of the richest hip-hop performers, having a net worth estimated at US $440 million in 2008.\\n\\nBefore 50 Cent ever inked a major deal, he built up a substantial fan base in New York through underground mixtapes. 50 Cent met up with Jam Master Jay of Run-DMC and was signed to his label to write all of Jay’s music. After he’d left JMJ, he signed to Columbia Records in 1996. On this label, he released Power of the Dollar, and the singles How to Rob and Ghetto Qua Ran. Columbia Records released him from the label after being shot on May 24th, 2000.\\n\\nAround this time, Eminem had heard one of 50 Cent’s demo tapes and expressed a huge interest in him on MTV, as did Dr. Dre. Shortly after this, 50 Cent officially signed to Interscope Records. He was the first rapper to sign to the joint label owned by Dr. Dre and Eminem. The first song he released on this record was entitled Wanksta and was featured on the 8 Mile soundtrack.\\n\\nIn its first week of release, his debut ”Get Rich Or Die Tryin’” sold 872,000 units - easily reaching Gold status. Within the second week it went Platinum (1 mil) and on April 12th, 2004 the RIAA certified it six times Platinum.\\n\\nIn 2005 he followed the success of his album Get Rich or Die Tryin’ with a new release - The Massacre (originally called St. Valentines Day Massacre until the release date was pushed back). The first single released off this, Disco Inferno, was a huge hit - he followed this hit up by the release of Candy Shop and then again with Just a Lil Bit.\\n\\nIn 2003 Interscope Records allowed 50 Cent to have his own label - G-Unit Records. He first signed Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo and Young Buck as the established members of G-Unit Records. In 2004, Dr. Dre and 50 Cent had signed The Game under a joint venture. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/50+Cent\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'From label boss, hit producer, World Champion DJ, trendsetter, genre-mangling party-starter, to blogger extraordinaire, Alain Macklovitch, best known as A-Trak, embodies the full scope of the 21st Century musician-entrepreneur model. At the mere age of 29, A-Trak has had two distinct phases to his winding 11 year career. Stage one: after winning the World DMCs at age 15 (in 1997), he spent years as one of hip hop’s most renowned selectors. After taking over tour DJ duties for Kanye West in 2004, just as he was beginning to combine a bigger variety of sounds into his sets, A-Trak launched into stage two: becoming an undisputed icon for a generation of kids that worship hip hop and dance music alike, and commencing a worldwide boundary-blurring takeover. It all started very early, and developed very quickly, for A-Trak. As a young teenager in Montreal, he would scratch on one turntable for his brother (of Chromeo) Dave’s high school band. He begun practising, “with the discipline of a monk”, and after winning the Canadian, and later World, DMCs found himself an honorary member of Q-Bert’s legendary Skratch Piklz crew. He soon hooked up with DJ Craze and joined another famous scratch troupe, The Allies, and spent half a decade touring as hip hop’s hottest turntablist crew. Five years ago, after a chance meeting with Kanye West at a London in-store, A-Trak performed his first gig with the superstar, without a rehearsal, in front of 12,000 people – and from then on did every show with him for four years. Three years ago, after meeting the rising Chicagoan rapper Kid Sister, A-Trak began dabbling his way into production, which – also by way of happenstance - led to the beginnings of a record label. Ironically named Fool’s Gold, considering how many prosperous treasures it’s unearthed, the label has gone on to become one of the most sought-after imprints on the underground radar: a cross-over idol that’s wildly and unpretentiously united the worlds of club music and hip hop.\\n\\n==Titles and Awards==\\n\\n*1997 Canadian DMC Champion\\n*1997 Technics / DMC World Champion (15 years old - youngest ever)\\n*1998 Technics DMC World finals (3rd place)\\n*1999 ITF Western Hemisphere Scratch Champion\\n*1999 ITF Advancement World Champion\\n*1999 Vestax Extravaganza World Champion\\n*2000 West Coast Technics / DMC Team Champion\\n*2000 Technics / DMC Team World Champion\\n*2000 ITF Advancement World Champion\\n\\n==Discography==\\n*\\'\\'[[Gangsta Breaks]]\\'\\' (12\")\\n*\\'\\'[[Buck Tooth Wizards]]\\'\\' (CD)\\n*\\'\\'[[The Grill/Like (with Obscure Disorder)]]\\'\\' (12\")\\n*\\'\\'[[Enter Ralph Wiggum]]\\'\\' (7\")\\n*\\'\\'[[Monkey Boy Breaks]]\\'\\' (12\")\\n*\\'\\'[[Don\\'t Fool With The Dips]]\\'\\' (12\")\\n*\\'\\'[[Oh No You Didn\\'t!

       " 'Anthony Cruz (born March 9, 1972 in Brooklyn, New York), better known by his stage name AZ, is a Grammy-nominated rapper currently residing in Englewood, New Jersey. He is mainly known for his close association with Nas, his membership in the hip hop supergroup The Firm, and his multi-syllabic rhyming pattern and deep content within his solo albums. He released his debut album, Doe or Die, in 1995 and has since released 1998\\'s Pieces of a Man, 2001\\'s 9 Lives, 2002\\'s Aziatic, 2005\\'s A.W.O.L., 2006\\'s The Format and 2008\\'s Undeniable. AZ is currently working on his 10th studio album titled Doe or Die 2 to be released sometime in 2011.\\n\\nBiography:\\nAZ was born Anthony Cruz to an African-American mother and a Dominican father. Although he had been rapping since 1992, AZ first came to prominence by appearing on Nas\\' landmark album Illmatic on the song \"Life\\'s a Bitch\" (1994)—he was the only guest emcee to appear on that album. After a bidding war, AZ signed with EMI, and soon released Doe Or Die (1995) to more critical acclaim than commercial sales. The album\\'s lead single, \"Sugar Hill\", became AZ\\'s only major commercial success as a solo artist, reaching the top 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and achieving Gold status. AZ\\'s EMI contract was transferred to sister label Noo Trybe Records/Virgin Records when the EMI Label Group was shut down.\\n\\nIn 1997, he and Nas appeared in an Sprite commercial.\\n\\nAZ\\'s fanbase grew considerably after he joined The Firm, a supergroup comprised of AZ, Nas, Foxy Brown, and Nature, with Dr. Dre and The Trackmasters producing. The Firm\\'s only album, The Album, was regarded as critically disappointing. Pieces of a Man, AZ\\'s second solo release, didn\\'t sell well. Independently, AZ released S.O.S.A. to little fanfare in 2000. Soon, however, AZ signed with Motown/Universal Records and released 9 Lives.\\n\\nIn 2002, he released Aziatic. A single from the album, \"The Essence,\" was nominated for the 2003 Grammy Awards for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. The video to its first single, \"I\\'m Back,\" received moderate MTV2 play. AZ was supposed to release an album titled Final Call, around late 2004 or early 2005. Due to massive bootlegging, however, the album was never released. Instead, A.W.O.L. was released on September 6, 2005. This album featured many tracks that were on the unreleased Final Call, as well as some new ones—the first single was the DJ Premier-produced \"The Come Up,\" and it became a moderately popular single.\\n\\nAZ\\'s sixth solo album The Format , was released on November 7, 2006.\\n\\nSince The Format, AZ has released a mixtape titled The Memphis Sessions and a J-Love mixtape titled The Return of S.O.S.A. His latest album Undeniable will be released in early 2008.\\n\\nStyle:\\nAZ is known for his smooth, rhythmic cadence of delivery. He is also known for his use of multi-syllable rhyme schemes, internal rhymes, unconventional rhymes, and a large vocabulary. AZ is \"one of the greatest rappers as far as lyrics and longevity\", his style and flow are instantly recognizable and comparable to his friend and collaborator Nas.\\n\\n Albums:\\n\\n    * 1995: Doe Or Die\\n    * 1997: The Firm: The Album\\n    * 1998: Pieces Of A Man\\n    * 2000: S.O.S.A.

       " 'Aaron Copland (November 14, 1900 in Brooklyn, New York, United States – December 2,1990) was an American composer who achieved a distinctive musical characterization of American themes in an expressive modern style.\\n\\nCopland, the son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, was born in New York City and attended public schools there. An older sister taught him to play the piano, and by the time he was 15 he had decided to become a composer. As a first step Copland tried to learn harmony through a correspondence course. Haltingly and in an environment not particularly conducive to art, he struggled toward his goal.\\n\\nIn the summer of 1921 Copland attended the newly founded school for Americans at Fontainebleau, where he came under the influence of Nadia Boulanger, a brilliant teacher who shaped the outlook of an entire generation of American musicians. He decided to stay on in Paris, where he became Boulanger’s first American student in composition. After three years in Paris, Copland returned to New York City with an important commission: Nadia Boulanger had asked him to write an organ concerto for her American appearances. Copland composed the piece while working as the pianist of a hotel trio at a summer resort in Pennsylvania. That season the Symphony for Organ and Orchestra had its premiere in Carnegie Hall with the New York Symphony under the direction of the composer and conductor Walter Damrosch.\\n\\nIn his growth as a composer Copland mirrored the important trends of his time. After his return from Paris, he worked with jazz rhythms in Music for the Theater (1925) and the Piano Concerto (1926). There followed a period during which he was strongly influenced by Igor Stravinsky’s Neoclassicism, turning toward an abstract style he described as “more spare in sonority, more lean in texture.” This outlook prevailed in the Piano Variations (1930), Short Symphony (1933), and Statements for Orchestra (1933–35). After this last work, there occurred a change of direction that was to usher in the most productive phase of Copland’s career. He well summed up the new orientation: “During these years I began to feel an increasing dissatisfaction with the relations of the music-loving public and the living composer. It seemed to me that we composers were in danger of working in a vacuum.” Furthermore, he realized that a new public for modern music was being created by the new media of radio, phonograph, and film scores: “It made no sense to ignore them and to continue writing as if they did not exist. I felt that it was worth the effort to see if I couldn’t say what I had to say in the simplest possible terms.” Copland therefore was led to what became a most significant development after the 1930s: the attempt to simplify the new music in order that it would have meaning for a large public.\\n\\nThe decade that followed saw the production of the scores that spread Copland’s fame throughout the world. Most important of these were the three ballets based on American folk material: Billy the Kid (1938), Rodeo (1942), and Appalachian Spring (1944; commissioned by dancer Martha Graham). To this group belong also El salón México (1936), an orchestral piece based on Mexican melodies and rhythms; two works for high-school students—the “play opera” The Second Hurricane (1937) and An Outdoor Overture (1938); and a series of film scores, of which the best known are Of Mice and Men (1939), Our Town (1940), The Red Pony (1948), and The Heiress (1948). Typical too of the Copland style are two major works that were written in time of war—Lincoln Portrait (1942), for speaker and chorus, on a text drawn from Lincoln’s speeches, and Letter from Home (1944), as well as the melodious Third Symphony (1946).\\n\\nIn his later years Copland refined his treatment of Americana: “I no longer feel the need of seeking out conscious Americanism. Because we live here and work here, we can be certain that when our music is mature it will also be American in quality.” His later works include an opera, The Tender Land (1954); Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson (1950), for voice and piano; and the delightful Nonet (1960). During these years Copland also produced a number of works in which he showed himself increasingly receptive to the serial techniques of the so-called 12-tone school of composer Arnold Schoenberg. Notable among such works are the stark and dissonant Piano Fantasy (1957); Connotations (1962), which was commissioned for the opening of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City; and Inscape (1967). The 12-tone works were not generally well-received; after 1970 Copland virtually stopped composing, though he continued to lecture and to conduct through the mid-1980s.\\n\\nFor the better part of four decades, as composer (of operas, ballets, orchestral music, band music, chamber music, choral music, and film scores), teacher, writer of books and articles on music, organizer of musical events, and a much sought after conductor, Copland expressed “the deepest reactions of the American consciousness to the American scene.” He received more than 30 honorary degrees and many additional awards. His books include What to Listen for in Music (1939), Music and Imagination (1952), Copland on Music (1960), and The New Music, 1900–60 (1968). With the aid of Vivian Perlis, he wrote a two-volume autobiography (Copland: 1900 Through 1942 [1984] and Copland: Since 1943 [1989]). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Aaron+Copland\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'John \"Ace\" Cannon (May 5, 1934 – December 6, 2018) was an American tenor and alto saxophonist. He played and toured with Hi Records stablemate Bill Black\\'s Combo, and started a solo career with his record \"Tuff\" in 1961, using the Black combo as his backing group. \"Tuff\" hit #17 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 1962, and the follow-up single \"Blues (Stay Away from Me)\" hit #36 that same year. In April 1965, he released Ace Cannon Live (HL 12025); according to the liner notes by Nick Pesce the album was recorded in front of a live audience inside Hi\\'s recording studio, and Pesce claims this was the first time such an album had ever been recorded (as opposed to previous live albums recorded in concert venues).\\n\\nCannon was inducted into both the Rock and Soul Hall of Fame and the Rockabilly Hall of Fame in 2000.[4] In May 2007, his hometown of Calhoun City, Mississippi, hosted its first annual Ace Cannon Festival, and on December 9, 2008, he was honored with induction into the Mississippi Musicians\\' Hall of Fame.\\n\\nAfter years of traveling and entertaining fans the world over, he moved back to Calhoun City in the late 1980s, where he resided until his passing. He played numerous dates each year, and would be found most days working on his golf game at his home course.\\n\\nHe died at his home on December 6, 2018, at the age of 84.\\n\\nAce Cannon started his career in Memphis, Tennessee, USA, recording on many of the 1950\\'s hits on SUN RECORDS. Says Sam Phillips: \"Ace Cannon is the greatest saxophone player who ever lived, but then he came out of the same stables as Carl Perkins, Elvis, Jerry Lee, Bill Justice, etc.\" In 1959 he started with the Bill Black\\'s Combo, which was one of the most popular instrumental groups of their era. They traveled the U.S. and the Bahamas, where he traveled on all concert dates and played the lead saxophone on all the original recordings. They appeared on the most prominent TV shows of that era, including The Ed Sullivan Show, The Merv Griffin Show, Dick Clark\\'s American Bandstand, and The Buddy Dean Show in Baltimore, MD.\\n\\nIn 1962 Ace recorded the instrumental smash \"TUFF\". Since that time he has recorded 52 albums and 37 singles, from the kind that gets nominated for Grammy Awards (such as his recording of \"Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain\") to million-selling TV albums (such as Golden Classics and The Entertainer). When he was paired with trumpeter legend Al Hirt, the result was a historic duet of country classics that could be one of the biggest TV albums in history.\\n\\nIn 1986, he performed on The Class of \\'55 album, which brought together Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Roy Orbison for a first time. This led Ace and Carl Perkins to perform together for the entire year of 1986, playing show dates all over the U.S., and a tour of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, and the World\\'s Fair in Vancouver, British Columbia.\\n\\nPresently considered one of the top artists for TV sales, Ace Cannon has made numerous appearances on \"Nashville Now\", \"New Country\", \"Charlie Daniels\\' Jam\", and \"Fan Fair.\" He has traveled far and wide appearing at concerts, clubs, fairs and major festivals. Also in 1986, he was asked by Dick Clark to join the All Star Band for the Country Music Academy TV Special.\\n\\nAce is considered a musical genius even as far away as the Caribbean, where more than 10,000 people recently showed up for two sold-out shows at The Spectakula Forum in tiny Port of Spain, Trinidad. This has been the main reason Ace was asked to return on at least a dozen tours in the Caribbean which included the islands of Barbados, Trinidad, Tobago and British Guyana, South America, Hamilton, Bermuda since 1975.\\n\\nAce Cannon has appeared as either a solo artist or with a full band. He is an artist that is on the rise again. His wide and varied repertoire contains everything from rock and roll to country standards to pop, and he is also no stranger to jazz and blues, which makes his music appeal to audiences of all ages and musical preferences.\\n\\nThe 1990s have been great for Ace as he has recorded two new CDs for WIRL records, located in Barbados, entitled Music For Lovers and Sweet Dreams. They have also been distributed in the U.S. with tremendous response. He has also overdubbed his terrific horn on some record tracks on the late and great Ivory Joe Hunter.\\n\\nIn 1997, Scotty Moore and D. J. Fontana, two of the original Elvis Presley Band, recorded an album entitled All The Kings Men, which consisted of 11 songs by various artists, such as Keith Richards, Ron Wood, Jeff Beck, Steve Earl, Ronnie McDowell and Bill Black\\'s Combo. Of the 11 songs on the record, the Bill Black\\'s Combo selection was nominated for a Grammy Award.

       " 'Along with Eddie Van Halen, Kiss\\' Ace Frehley inspired numerous up-and-coming rockers to pick up the guitar in the 1970s, and by the next century he was listed by just about every contemporary rock guitarist as an important influence. Operating under the glossy, platform boot-bolstered persona Spaceman (sometimes Space Ace), Frehley played with Kiss from the group\\'s inception in 1973 to 1982, when he embarked on a successful solo career. He rejoined the group in 1998 for their international reunion tour, and stayed with them through 2002, eventually returning to his solo work in 2009 with the release of Anomaly. Having beaten his addiction to drugs and alcohol in the interim, Frehley enjoyed a creative surge in the 2010s, issuing a string of well-received albums like Space Invader (2014) and Spaceman (2018), and releasing a popular 2011 autobiography, No Regrets: A Rock \\'N\\' Roll Memoir.\\n\\nBorn Paul Frehley on April 27, 1951, in the Bronx, New York, Frehley began playing guitar when he received an electric six-string for his 14th birthday in 1965. Already a big fan of the Rolling Stones, he was blown away when he caught a multi-band live show in N.Y.C. in early 1967, featuring both the Who and Cream, among others, which solidified his desire to pursue rock guitar more seriously (and put a promising art career on the back burner). Frehley began playing in local bands soon after, adding both Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix to his influences -- and around this time, adopted the nickname \"Ace.\" Although none of the bands he played with had taken off, he answered an ad in a local paper for a new hard rock, theatrically based group in early 1973.\\n\\nA few weeks after his initial tryout, Frehley was hired as the lead guitarist for the new quartet, joining bassist/singer Gene Simmons, rhythm guitarist/singer Paul Stanley, and drummer Peter Criss to form the band Kiss. By year\\'s end, the greasepaint- and costume-wearing band was signed to Casablanca Records, and by 1978, had become one of the world\\'s top hard rock bands. A string of platinum albums and sold-out tours lasted from 1975 until 1979, until the trappings of fame threatened to break up the band. Frehley\\'s best friend in the band, Criss, left Kiss in 1980, as the group unsuccessfully experimented with non-metal styles. Ace Frehley\\'s use of alcohol and drugs increased due to his ever-increasing unhappiness in the band, and, by 1982, he\\'d exited Kiss.\\n\\nWithin a year or two after his split from Kiss, Ace began putting his own solo band together, Frehley\\'s Comet. The band played local N.Y.C. clubs, but failed to issue a record until 1987\\'s self-titled debut for Megaforce Records. Instead of following the heavy metal direction of his exceptional 1978 solo album, Frehley\\'s Comet tried to keep pace with the current pop-metal movement (Mötley Crüe, etc.), issuing two other albums (and a live EP) by 1989. Around this time, Frehley put his old art talents to use once again through computer graphics, with a few of his images even being featured in an art exhibit. Despite mudslinging in the press between Simmons/Stanley and Frehley in the early \\'90s, all four original Kiss members made up in time to reunite for a 1995 taping of MTV Unplugged. The taping was such a success that it led to a full-blown reunion of the original lineup, resulting in the massively successful 1996-1997 Alive Worldwide Tour.\\n\\nFrehley continued as a member of Kiss until the end of their Farewell Tour (lasting longer than fellow original member Peter Criss, who dropped out in 2001). Live appearances, including gigs at the massive Rocklahoma festival, kept Ace busy until 2009, when he released the album Anomaly on his own label, Bronx Born Records. In 2011 he published No Regrets, a detailed and frank memoir that recounted, among other things, his aforementioned struggles with alcohol and cocaine addiction. In 2013 he celebrated seven years of sobriety and spent much of that year appearing at horror, sci-fi, and pop culture conventions.\\n\\nThe following April, after a long wait, Kiss was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, before August brought the release of Space Invader, a solo album that took a heavier approach than Anomaly. Released in 2016, Origins, Vol. 1 was an all-covers album featuring songs from Ace\\'s favorite bands, up to and including Kiss, with new versions of \"Parasite\" and \"Cold Gin\" sitting next to songs from Thin Lizzy and Cream. The following year, Frehley joined Kiss bassist/vocalist Simmons on-stage at a Hurricane Harvey benefit for the Children Matter organization in St. Paul, Minnesota. It was the first time the former bandmates had performed together in over 16 years. In 2018 Frehley issued his eighth solo long payer, Spaceman, which featured a power pop cover of Eddie Money\\'s \"I Wanna Go Back\" and the rowdy single \"Rockin\\' with the Boys,\" the latter of which was written during Kiss\\' \\'70s heyday. He then released a second covers album, Origins, Vol. 2, in September 2020.\\n\\nBiography by Greg Prato\\n\\nWebsite: http://www.acefrehley.com\\n\\nAce Frehley (1978)\\nFrehley\\'s Comet (1987)\\nSecond Sighting (1988)\\nTrouble Walkin\\' (1989)\\nAnomaly (2009)\\nSpace Invader (2014)\\nOrigins Vol. 1 (2016)\\nSpaceman (2018)\\nOrigins Vol. 2 (2020) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ace+Frehley\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Following a football injury in the tenth grade he began to seriously consider rapping as a career. In 2007, he met DJ Khaled and gave him his demo tape. Khaled asked Ace to rap over the instrumental of I\\'m So Hood and then decided to sign him. His debut album, Gutta, was released in 2008 and featured appearances from T-Pain, Rick Ross, Akon, Flo Rida and Trey Songz. His second album, Ruthless, was released in June 2009 and debuted at #23 on the Billboard 200.\\n\\nPFFFFFF! Yeah right! What are you? The King of Knots? You think you\\'re the freaking King of Tying Knots??\\n\\nFlorida’s heat has been radiating over hip-hop for many years. From the legendary “Uncle” Luke Campbell, Trick Daddy and Trina to DJ Khaled, Flo Rida, T-Pain, Rick Ross and Plies, the sunshine state has always produced hot music. The next artist to emerge from this sizzling climate is Ace Hood, and with an ace on the top of the deck, he is guaranteed to continue Florida’s heat wave.\\n\\n“I got the name Ace as a child. My family always thought that I would be the one who would succeed in whatever I did,” he explains. “I feel like I’m an army in myself. I carry my own weight and since I represent for the hood, why not attach that to my name?” \\n\\nBorn Antoine McColister in Broward County, Florida, Ace knew he was destined for greatness. After an injury derailed his burgeoning football career, Ace turned to his true passion, rapping. At the age of 17, Ace teamed up with the Broward-County-based entertainment label, Dollaz & Dealz, to record the hit \"M.O.E.\" (\"Money Over Everything\") which sparked an immediate buzz in South Florida. Ace began to perform and network which helped him gain exposure like never before. After fine-tuning his craft on local crowds, he set his sights on performing for DJ Khaled at his annual birthday bash. \\n\\n“We was outside the radio station not even trying to get a deal, just hoping to perform at his birthday bash,” he recalls. “We just figured we’d try and perform. He had a contest going on where you had to give a certain amount of reasons why you should perform at the birthday bash. So I was going to rap for him on camera and show him why I was worthy. Although he had to go to a meeting, he came out, looked at me and said I love his image. We handed him a CD and once we did that he listened to it and called my manager that night. He said I love his swag, I hear starvation in his music and I want to take a meeting with him.” \\n\\nThat meeting turned into Ace becoming the first artist signed to DJ Khaled’s label “We the Best” distributed by Def Jam Records. His hot new single “Cash Flow” featuring T-Pain and Rick Ross is currently blazing the radio waves everywhere. “Once I played the song for Rick Ross he loved it and he put his whole swag to it” explains Khaled. “The song was pretty much done but we felt to make it more of a hit record, get somebody like T-Pain who’s running the game right now, on the hook to make it go that much further.” The song is setting the stage for Ace’s debut album, Gutta, with guest appearances from some of rap’s elite including Trick Daddy, Flo Rida, Akon, Plies and production from Cool & Dre, The Runners, Danjahandz and J.U.S.T.C.E. League, Ace’s deck is definitely stacked. \\n\\n“This album is definitely gonna be a classic,” Ace says confidently. “People are expecting a lot out of me not only because I’m on Khaled’s label, but because everyone knows that the ace is ranked as the highest.” \\n\\nWith an ace up your sleeve, how can you go wrong?\\n\\n\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ace+Hood\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Ariyan Arslani (born December 2, 1983), better known by the stage name Action Bronson, is an American rapper, writer, chef, and television presenter. In August 2012, he signed with Warner Bros. Records, but was later moved to the Atlantic Records-distributed label Vice Records.\\n\\nArslani hosts a talk/variety show The Untitled Action Bronson Show, as well as his travel program Fuck, That\\'s Delicious, on Viceland. His frequent collaborators Meyhem Lauren, The Alchemist, and formerly Big Body Bes are regulars on both of his television series. Mario Batali, Andrew Zimmern, Daniel Boulud, Rick Bayless, Grant Achatz, and others have been guests on his television series. In September 2017, Arslani published his first book, based on his travel show, a cookbook, also entitled Fuck, That\\'s Delicious.\\n\\nArslani has also released several mixtapes, such as Rare Chandeliers (2012), with American hip-hop producer The Alchemist and Blue Chips 2 (2013) with longtime producer Party Supplies, before releasing his major label debut, an extended play (EP) titled Saaab Stories, with frequent collaborator Harry Fraud, in 2013. He released his major label debut album, Mr. Wonderful, on March 23, 2015.\\n\\nInfluences\\nAction Bronson cites as major influences fellow American rappers Kool G Rap, Nas, Cam\\'ron, Mobb Deep, UGK and the Wu-Tang Clan. Other artists include Michael Jackson, Carlos Santana, Queen as well as Albanian wedding singers.\\n\\nRapping style\\nBronson frequently raps about food in his songs. He is also well known for his frequent, and often obscure, allusions to athletes and sports teams. Bronson\\'s lyrics often make reference to sports in New York City but also touch on more obscure subjects such as professional wrestlers, bodybuilders, figure skating and sports betting.\\n\\nEarly in his career, Bronson gained recognition for lyrically and stylistically resembling fellow New York rapper Ghostface Killah of Wu-Tang Clan (with whom he collaborated, along with friend and fellow rapper Termanology, on a song called \"Meteor Hammer\", from the 2011 compilation album Legendary Weapons). Ghostface Killah himself has admitted to confusing Bronson\\'s rapping for his own. In a 2011 interview with HipHopDX, Bronson was asked about how it was to be compared to the Wu-Tang rapper, and he responded with,\\n\\nYeah, I mean at the end of the day, it\\'s all good because Ghostface Killah is one of the best rappers alive, so if I sound similar to the best rapper alive then that is fine. To me there is no comparison; he is a legend and I am a newcomer. If I would try and emulate with anyone it would be Kool G Rap, he is the person I look up to the most. I am not upset but at the end of the day I am my own person and no one can take that away from me.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nBronson has two children with a former girlfriend. Bronson\\'s current girlfriend gave birth to a son in November 2019.\\n\\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Bronson documented his weight loss journey using a combination of diet change and high-intensity interval training.

       " 'Adam Ant is the stage name of Stuart Leslie Goddard (born November 3, 1954, London, England), lead singer of 1980s pop group Adam and the Ants and also a solo artist.  \\n\\nAdam was a member of Bazooka Joe, the band that the Sex Pistols opened for in the Pistols\\' first live appearance. Adam and the Ants started as a punk band, but by the early \\'80s they had taken a different path and started making pop music. By 1981 they were one of the biggest bands in Britain.\\n\\nIn March 1982, feeling certain band members \"lacked enthusiasm\", Ant disbanded the group. A few months after the split Ant launched a solo career (though he retained Marco Pirroni as guitarist and co-songwriter).\\n\\nAfter the split, Ant went solo, taking his song writing partner Pirroni with him. His greatest American chart success was 1982\\'s Friend or Foe album, which included the hit single \"Goody Two Shoes\" which made it to #1 in the UK and Australia, and #12 in the U.S. Other hits from that album included the title song (which made #9 on the UK chart) and \"Desperate But Not Serious\". Goody Two Shoes first charted in the UK in Spring 1982, reaching no.1 that summer, but its US peak did not come until 1983 when it reached #12 on the Billboard Top 100.\\n\\nIn 1983, Ant worked with Phil Collins and Richard James Burgess on the \"Strip\" album which was recorded at Polar Studios in Stockholm. The single \"Puss \\'N Boots\" reached #5 on the UK charts, but the BBC banned both the video and the song for the follow-up single \"Strip,\" which peaked at #41. Although Strip had some highlights and hit singles, it marked the end of his reign as one of Britain\\'s top pop stars for a while. That same year, Ant also memorably appeared as a guest performer on the NBC television network\\'s Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever special that aired in May.\\n\\nIn 1985, he worked with veteran producer Tony Visconti on his third solo album, \"Vive Le Rock\". He secured a spot at the Live Aid concert, but was asked to cut his set to one song. He chose his new single, \"Vive le Rock.\" Vive Le Rock was intended to be his ultimate hard rock album but the single underwent a pressing error and the album received mixed reviews. As a result, Adam decided to end his career in music and focus on his acting career.\\n\\nIn 1989, whilst maintaining an interest in acting, Ant returned to America and re-entered the pop music world with the album \"Manners & Physique\", a collaboration with André Cymone, a solo artist and an early member of Prince\\'s band. The album was another moderate success, and featured the UK and U.S. hit single \"Room at the Top\". \"Rough Stuff\" became the second single for the United States and Germany as \"Can\\'t Set Rules About Love\" charted in the United Kingdom.\\n\\nIn 1993, he toured in support of a planned album called \"Persuasion\". On account of a regime change at MCA, the record company made the unilateral decision not to release this album on the basis that Manners & Physique had failed to achieve a gold sales certification. Ant was subsequently released from his contract with MCA and later signed by EMI. Persuasion remains unreleased to this day and, as a result, it has become something of a lost legend among \"Antfans\", although it is widely available online for download.\\n\\nIn 1995, Ant released the album \"Wonderful\". The title track was a successful single, as was a tour of the U.S. in support of the album. While Ant and his group (which retained longtime guitarist Pirroni) played in smaller venues than they had played in the 1980s, the houses were often packed with enthusiastic fans. The tour was cut short due to Ant and Pirroni both contracting glandular fever (for those who don\\'t know the term, glandular fever is generally a euphemism for what usually manifests as mononucleosis).\\n\\n\"Adam Ant Is the Blueblack Hussar in Marrying the Gunner\\'s Daughter\" is the sixth solo studio album by Adam Ant. The album\\'s title was announced by Ant in the NME in April 2010. As per Adam\\'s announcement at his gig in Chatham in September 2012, the new album was released on 21 January 2013 by Ant\\'s own record label Blueblack Hussar Records. Despite the independent self-release, the album reached number 25 on the UK Albums Chart, only one place lower than its predecessor, released on the major EMI label nearly eighteen years earlier.

At age 15, he moved to Orlando, Florida to enjoy four years of working as a Mouseketeer on the Disney Channel\\'s \"All New Mickey Mouse Club.\" After high school and the end of the show, he moved to Los Angeles to continue his career as a professional entertainer.

From the Joni Mitchell-laced \"Songbird\" to the Eagles-like \"Darlin\\' I\" Lucca reveals his earliest influences with the kind of maturity and respect that only comes with time.

       " 'Erroll Garner (1921–1977) was a U.S. jazz pianist and composer, whose distinctive and melodic style brought him both popular acclaim and the admiration of his peers.\\n\\nErroll Louis Garner was born on 15th June 1921 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and began playing the piano at the age of three. At the age of seven he began appearing on radio station KDKA in Pittsburgh with a group called the Candy Kids. By the age of eleven he was playing on the Allegheny riverboats. At the age of fourteen in 1937 he joined local saxophonist Leroy Brown.\\n\\nHe played locally in the shadow of his older pianist brother, Linton Garner, and moved to New York in 1944. He briefly worked with the bassist Slam Stewart, and though not a bebop musician, in 1947 he played with Charlie Parker on the famous \"Cool Blues\" session. Although his admission to the Pittsburgh music union was initially refused because of his inability to read music, they eventually relented in 1956 and made him an honorary member. Garner is credited with having a superb memory for music; after attending a concert by the Russian pianist Emil Gilels, Garner returned to his apartment and was able to play a large portion of the performed music.\\n\\nHis 1955 recording Concert by the Sea ranks among his very best work. Ironically this recording of a performance at an army base in Carmel, California, featuring Eddie Calhoun on bass and Denzil Best on drums, was made using relatively primitive sound equipment, but Garner\\'s inventiveness and swing made its point in each tune. Other notable works include 1951\\'s Long Ago and Far Away and 1974\\'s Magician, both of which see Erroll perform a number of classic standards in his own style. Often the trio was expanded to add Latin percussion, usually a conga, with electric results.\\n\\nWhat made Erroll easy to recognise were his trademark introductions, that seemed to make no sense but broke dramatically into his exposition of the tune he was to play, and the guitar strumming sound of his left hand, playing crotchet accompaniment to his rich-sounding right hand. This approach suggests that he was influenced by the iconic rhythm guitar work of Count Basie\\'s long time guitarist, Freddie Green. But discerning listeners could find that while his even-four left hand was a fixture, it was far from being the only rhythmic approach he took to playing. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Erroll+Garner\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album\\'s first single, as well as Howard\\'s image, can be described as hyper-sexual; her debut album helped to open the doors for female rap artists to incorporate sexually explicit material into their works in the future. Howard\\'s second studio album, Welcome to Fantasy Island, garnered critical raves, but was shelved by Elektra Records before its intended release in July 1997. Following years of being unofficially released, Howard announced that her second album would arrive on streaming services in February 2021.\\n\\nIn 2003, news of her third album hit with various album title changes throughout the year from Ride Again: 7/2  to Two Can Play That Game.

Despite the lack of publicity, it sold over 40,000 copies.\\n\\nIn 2005, Howard intended to release The Second Coming: Remixed but that project was shelved to make way for a new full-length album, Private Show. Along with a new album, Howard worked with Walid Azami to bring documentaries for her fansite.

After some delays, Howard\\'s third album was released on June 27, 2007 with the lead single, \"L.O.V.A.\" It managed to peak #17 on iTunes R&B music sales chart.

In the latter respect, he has also been a creator of a comic genre, with his characteristic walking and his facial expressions. For the most part, his films were commercially successful, in fact in the 1970s and part of the 1980s, he was the king of the Italian box office in low budget movies. As an actor, critics point to Serafino (1968), directed by Pietro Germi, as his best effort.\\n\\nAs a director he frequently casts Ornella Muti, Eleonora Giorgi and his wife Claudia Mori. His best movie like director is \"Yuppi Du\", winner of The Golden Palm at Cannes Festival.

He was very popular from 1975 to 1980 on both sides of the iron curtain.\\nHe was born in Brazil, to a Brazilian father and Mozambique-origin mother, but at the age of 9 (after his father\\'s death) he and his mother had to move to her motherland Mozambique on the east coast of Africa, in the capital city Lourenço Marques, now Maputo. Once, when he appeared on stage in Maputo, his manager asked him to come to London.\\n\\nWith first steps in show business in London, he has gathered invaluable experience for appearances in other European capitals. He gathered experience in doing gigs all over Europe. He was lucky that Eddie Barclay, the French record tycoon went to see a show in Paris. They immediately signed the contract.\\n\\nAfric Simone speaks German, English, Portuguese, French, Spanish and various African languages, however his songs are written in the mixture of Swahili and few words from other languages. This idea resulted in a mixture of his own native tongue and European Happy Sound. Simone is also said to have pioneered the arts of Break Dancing and Beat Boxing as can be seen in his live performances, for instance in the televised performance of his song Playa Blanca c. 1975.\\n\\nRecently he settled in Germany (in Berlin) with a Russian wife whom he met a few years ago at the music festival \"Discoteque 80\\'s\" in Moscow, and has been appearing in TV shows in France, Italy, Germany and Lithuania. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Afric+Simone\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " ' Agnes Carlsson (credited simply as Agnes), born 6 March 1988 in Vänersborg, is a Swedish pop, R&B and dance singer who rose to fame as the winner of the second series of the Swedish singing competition Idol in 2005. She has since gone on to be one of Sweden\\'s most popular and best-selling female singers, selling over 160,000 albums in her home country alone.\\n\\nIn the spring of 2005, a 17-year-old Carlsson auditioned for the second series of phenomenally popular Swedish singing competition Idol in Göteborg, singing \"Varje Gång Jag Ser Dig\" by Lisa Nilsson. The four judges were all hugely impressed by the strong power of her voice and she successfully passed through to the theatre rounds of the contest. Her vocals continued to impress, and she made it to the semi-finals. To the dismay of the judges, Carlsson did not get a place in the final eleven contestants, and when she again failed to grab a place through the special \\'wildcard\\' round, they decided to pass her through to the finals as the judges\\' choice contestant. Despite this setback, Carlsson wowed both the judges and the public during every week of the finals, and after making it to the grand finale nine weeks later, she defeated runner-up Sebastian Karlsson and was crowned as the second Swedish Idol. Throughout the finals, Carlsson had never landed in the bottom 2 or 3, and she is currently one of only 4 wildcard contestants to win an Idol competition anywhere in the world. She was preceded in 2004 by Canada\\'s Ryan Malcolm and Kazakhstan\\'s Almas Kishkenbayev, and followed in 2007 by Australia\\'s Natalie Gauci.\\n\\nImmediately after winning Idol, Carlsson signed a recording contract with Sony BMG and her debut single, \"Right Here Right Now\" was released. A week later, the song debuted at number one on the Swedish singles chart, a position it held for six weeks. It was quickly certified double platinum for the sale of 40,000 copies in Sweden. Just one week later, on December 19, 2005, her debut album Agnes was released to positive reviews and massive opening week sales. It shot into the albums chart a week later at number one, a position it held for two consecutive weeks.\\n\\nIn March 2006, whilst touring in support of her debut album, Carlsson released her second single, \"Stranded\". Although it received positive critical reviews, the single did not gain commercial success and stalled in the singles chart at number twenty-seven. Despite this however, Carlsson\\'s debut album continued to enjoy huge sales success, selling over 90,000 copies in Sweden alone. It was certified double platinum and to date holds the record for being the highest-selling album by any Idol contestant.\\n\\nOn August 22, 2006, only eight months after her Idol win, Carlsson\\'s third single \"Kick Back Relax\" premiered on the TV-show \"Sommarkrysset\". The song, which would serve as the lead single from her much anticipated sophomore album, was released on September 7 and narrowly missed the top spot on the Swedish singles chart, peaking at number two. Her second album, Stronger was released on October 11, less than a year after the release of her debut. Like its predecessor, Stronger debuted at number one on the albums chart, and went on to sell 50,000 copies, certifying it platinum. One of the album\\'s tracks, \"Love Is All Around\" has since been covered by numerous singers in three continents, the most notable being by Australian Idol alumni Ricki Lee Coulter, which peaked at number two in Australia and became one of the country\\'s biggest hits in 2007.\\n\\nOn November 15, Carlsson released \"Champion\", the second single from her sophomore album. The song peaked at number nineteen, seemingly setting a pattern of high-low chart positions for Carlsson, which had also occurred with the two singles from her first album. In early 2007, Carlsson embarked upon her second national tour in just over one year. In December, Carlsson and her former Idol fellow contestant Måns Zelmerlöw joined forces for a huge Christmas campaign for clothing store MQ. In order to promote the company, they released a cover of the Mariah Carey song \"All I Want For Christmas Is You\", which peaked at number three on the Swedish singles chart.\\n\\nIn early 2008, it was announced that Carlsson had parted ways with her record label Sony BMG, citing creative differences as the reason behind the split. She quickly signed to record company Roxy Records, who stated that after taking a short break from the music industry, Carlsson would return with her third studio album, the first with her new label. On August 11, Carlsson\\'s fifth single \"On And On\" was passed to radio stations and released as a digital download. Geared towards the dance and club genre, the single was a clear change of artistic direction for Carlsson\\'s music, which had previously consisted of pop and RnB. The first public performance of the single was on August 16 during the Swedeish TV-show \"Sommarkrysset\". The single debuted at number twenty-seven, but following its physical release it surged up the chart and spent three weeks at its peak of number 8, as well as charting at the top spot of the dance and club charts.\\n\\nOn September 13, Kaj Kindvall, the host of the radioshow \"Tracks\" announced that Carlsson\\'s highly anticipated third studio album would be called \"Dance Love Pop\" and then went on to explain the reason behind the record\\'s name: \"Dance Love Pop covers the three things that the music is all about on this album; dance-music that has a twist of pop and is about love\". Roxy Records confirmed the album\\'s title four days later, and also stated that the release date of the album would be October 29, 2008.\\n\\nIn an interview with Swedish radio channel P3 the song \"Love Me Senseless\" was played, and although it was confirmed as a track on Carlsson\\'s third album, it was not confirmed whether it would be released as the second single. The album Dance! Love! Pop! was released on October 28 and debuted on the Swedish albums chart at number 5 with sales of 10,000 copies. On November 24, \"Release Me\" was released as the second single from the album. It debuted on the Swedish singles chart at number 60 based on digital downloads alone, whilst the album was certified gold for the sale of 20,000 copies since its release.\\n\\n\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Agnes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She has had a long and fruitful solo career, as well as recording duets with artists such as Peter Cetera, Tomas Ledin and Ola Håkansson.\\n\\nAgnetha was born in 1950 in Jönköping, Sweden. She began her singing career around 1967 as lead singer for the Bernt Enghardt band, a typical 1960s Swedish dance band. In 1968, she signed a contract as a solo artist and released her first album, Agnetha Fältskog.  It was a significant hit, as were the follow-ups, Agnetha Fältskog Vol. 2 (1969) and Som jag är (1970). By this time, Agnetha was established as a major recording star in Sweden. \\n\\nIn 1969, Agnetha had become romantically involved with Björn Ulvaeus. Björn was at that time working with fellow songwriter/producer Benny Andersson on a series of projects. One such project was an occasional singing group, Festfolket, comprising of Agnetha, Björn, Benny and Benny\\'s girlfriend, Anni-Frid Lyngstad (who also recorded as Frida).\\n\\nDuring this time, Agnetha\\'s solo career continued with more successes, including taking the role of Mary Magdalene in the Swedish stage version of Jesus Christ Superstar.

       " 'Ahmad Jamal (born Frederick Russell Jones in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on 2 July 1930; died 16 April 2023) was an American jazz pianist, composer, bandleader, and educator. For six decades, he was one of the most successful small-group leaders in jazz.[2] He was a National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) Jazz Master and won a Lifetime Achievement Grammy for his contributions to music history. While he invariably recorded as part of a trio or quintet, some releases were as Ahmad Jamal Trio and Ahmad Jamal Quintet. \\n\\nA child prodigy who began to play the piano at the age of three, he began formal studies at age seven.  While in high school, he completed the equivalent of college master classes under the noted African-American concert singer and teacher Mary Cardwell Dawson and pianist James Miller.  He joined the musicians’ union at the age of 14, and he began touring upon graduation from Westinghouse High School at the age of 17, drawing critical acclaim for his solos.  In 1951 he formed his first trio, The Three Strings.  Performing at New York’s The Embers club, Record Producer John Hammond “discovered” The Three Strings and signed them to Okeh Records (a division of Columbia, now Sony, Records.)\\n\\nIn 1956, Jamal, who had already been joined by bassist Israel Crosby in 1955, replaced guitarist Ray Crawford with a drummer.  Working as the “house trio” at Chicago’s Pershing Hotel in 1958, drummer Vernell Fournier joined this trio and Mr. Jamal made an on-location recording for Argo (Chess) Records entitled But Not For Me.  The resulting hit single and album, which also included Poinciana - - his rendition, now Mr. Jamal’s “trademark, “ remained on the Ten Best – selling charts - - amazingly for a jazz album - - an unprecedented 108 weeks!  This financial success enabled Mr. Jamal to realize a dream, and he opened a restaurant/club, The Alhambra, in Chicago.  Here the trio was able to perform while limiting their touring schedule.\\n\\nConsidering his trio \"an orchestra\", Jamal not only achieves a unified sound, but subtly inserted independent roles for the bass and drums.  The hallmarks of Jamal\\'s style are rhythmic innovations, colorful harmonic perceptions, especially left-hand harmonic and melodic figures, plus parallel and contrary motion lines in and out of chordal substitutions and alterations and pedal point ostinato interludes in tasteful dynamics.  He also incorporates a unique sense of space in his music, and his musical concepts are exciting without being loud in volume.  Augmented by a selection of unusual standards and his own compositions, Mr. Jamal would notably impress and influence, among others, trumpeter Miles Davis.\\n\\nIn 1951, Jamal first recorded Ahmad\\'s Blues on Okeh Records.  His arrangement of the folk tune Billy Boy, and Poinciana (not his original composition), also stem from this period.  In 1955, he recorded his first Argo (Chess) Records album that included New Rhumba, Excerpts From The Blues, Medley (actually I Don\\'t Want To Be Kissed), and It Ain\\'t Necessarily So, -- all later utilized by Miles Davis and Gil Evans on the albums Miles Ahead and Porgy and Bess.  \\n\\nIn his autobiography, Miles Davis praised Jamal\\'s special artistic qualities and cites his influence.  In fact, the mid-to-late 1950s Miles Davis Quintet recordings notably feature material previously recorded by Jamal: Squeeze Me, It Could Happen To You, But Not For Me, Surrey With -The Fringe On Top, Ahmad\\'s Blues, On Green Dolphin Street and Billy Boy\\n\\nIn 1994, Jamal received the American Jazz Masters fellowship award from the National Endowment for the Arts.  The same year he was named a Duke Ellington Fellow at Yale University, where he performed commissioned works with the Assai String Quartet.\\n\\nIn 1970, Jamal performed the title composition by Johnny Mandel for the soundtrack of the film MASH!; and in 1995, two tracks from his smash album But Not For Me--Music, Music, Music, and Poinciana were featured in the Clint Eastwood film The Bridges of Madison County.\\n\\nJamal\\'s 1996 release, The Essence (Verve 529 327-2) features a first -- a recording made with a horn, tenor saxophonist George Coleman.  Already released in Europe, the album has received such critical comments as \"Historique!\" as well as the resulting outstanding sales and the\"CHOC\" award in France.  The album has also received the D\\'jango award, and a concert at Salle Pleyel was sold out.\\n\\nHal Leonard Publications issued The Ahmad Jamal Collection Piano Transcriptions in 1998.  \\n\\nIn 1994 Mr. Jamal received the National Endowment of the Arts American Jazz Masters award and also was named a Duke Ellington Fellow at Yale University. \\n\\nIn June of 2007 the French Government inducted Jamal into the prestigious Order of the Arts and Letters by French Culture Minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, naming him Officier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.  Former recipients being William Faulkner, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Jackson Pollack, Ella Fitzgerald, Alan Ginsberg and Tony Morrison. \\n\\nHis 2008 recording, “It’s Magic”, hit the US charts at #13 immediately after its release. It graced the Billboard Top Jazz Albums chart, the iTunes Jazz Top 10, and it recently peaked at #2 on the Jazz Week Radio Chart In France.   Jamal was awarded Best International Album (Album International de Production Francaise) by Les Victoire du Jazz, the French version of the Grammys.  The album also garnered Record of the Year by Jazz Man magazine.  \\n\\nIn his 80s, Jamal continued to make numerous tours and recordings, including albums such as Saturday Morning (2013), the CD/DVD release Ahmad Jamal Featuring Yusef Lateef Live at L\\'Olympia (2014), and Marseille (2017). \\n\\nahmadjamal.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ahmad+Jamal\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.\\n\\nMann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to \"sweetness and melody\", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band \\'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann\\'s breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann\\'s signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song \"Time Stand Still\" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, \\'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything\\'s Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.\\n\\nAround the time of the first album\\'s release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final \\'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song \"J For Jules\". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann\\'s manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.\\n\\nSolo career\\nIn 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995\\'s I\\'m with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.\\n\\nMann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.\\n\\nMeanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since \"Voices Carry\" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson\\'s Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, \"Save Me\". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann\\'s lyrics to create the film\\'s characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry\\'s indifference.\\n\\nIndependence\\nFed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song \"Calling It Quits\", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann\\'s \"more indie than indie\" success was carefully noted by other musicians.\\n\\nMann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.\\n\\nAimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann\\'s Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.\\n\\nMann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the \\'70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann\\'s interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to \"forget\" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow.

       " 'Alois Maxwell \"Al\" Hirt (November 7, 1922 – April 27, 1999) was an American trumpeter and bandleader. He is best remembered for his million-selling recordings of \"Java\" and the accompanying album Honey in the Horn (1963), and for the theme song to The Green Hornet. His nicknames included \"Jumbo\" and \"The Round Mound of Sound\". Colin Escott, an author of musician biographies, wrote that RCA Victor Records, for which Hirt had recorded most of his best-selling recordings and for which he had spent much of his professional recording career, had dubbed him with another moniker: \"The King.\" Hirt was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in November 2009.\\n\\nHirt was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of a police officer. At the age of six, he was given his first trumpet, which had been purchased at a local pawnshop. He would play in the Junior Police Band with the children of Alcide Nunez, and by the age of 16, Hirt was playing professionally, often with his friend Pete Fountain. During this time, he was hired to play at the local horse racing track, beginning a six-decade connection to the sport.\\n\\nIn 1940, Hirt went to Cincinnati, Ohio, to study at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music with Dr. Frank Simon (a former soloist with the John Philip Sousa Orchestra). After a stint as a bugler in the United States Army during World War II, Hirt performed with various swing big bands, including those of Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, and Ina Ray Hutton.\\n\\nIn 1950, Hirt became first trumpet and featured soloist with Horace Heidt\\'s Orchestra. After spending several years on the road with Heidt, Hirt returned to New Orleans working with various Dixieland groups and leading his own bands. Despite Hirt\\'s statement years later \"I\\'m not a jazz trumpeter and never was a jazz trumpeter\", he made a few recordings where he demonstrated his ability to play in that style, during the 1950s with bandleader Monk Hazel, and a few other recordings on the local Southland Records label.\\n\\nHirt\\'s virtuoso dexterity and fine tone on his instrument soon attracted the attention of major record labels and he signed with RCA Victor. Hirt posted twenty-two albums on the Billboard charts in the 1950s and 1960s. The albums Honey in the Horn and Cotton Candy were both in the Top 10 best sellers for 1964, the same year Hirt scored a hit single with his cover of Allen Toussaint\\'s tune \"Java\" (Billboard No. 4), and later won a Grammy Award for the same recording. Both Honey in the Horn and \"Java\" sold over one million copies, and were awarded gold discs.\\n\\nHirt\\'s Top 40 charted hit \"Sugar Lips\" in 1964 would be later used as the theme song for the NBC daytime game show Eye Guess, hosted by Bill Cullen and originally airing from January 1966 to September 1969.\\n\\nHirt was chosen to record the frenetic theme for the 1960s TV show The Green Hornet, by famed arranger and composer Billy May. Thematically reminiscent of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov\\'s Flight of the Bumblebee, it showcased Hirt\\'s technical prowess. The recording again gained public attention in 2003 when it was used in the film Kill Bill.\\n\\nFrom the mid-1950s to early 1960s, Hirt and his band played nightly at Dan\\'s Pier 600 at the corner of St. Louis and Bourbon Street. The club was owned by his business manager, Dan Levy, Sr.\\n\\nAl Hirt club on the corner of Bourbon Street and St Louis in the French Quarter, 1977\\nIn 1962 Hirt opened his own club on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter, which he ran until 1983. He also became a minority owner in the NFL expansion New Orleans Saints in 1967.\\n\\nIn 1962, in an effort to showcase him in a different musical setting, Hirt was teamed with arranger and composer Billy May and producer Steve Sholes to record an album titled Horn A Plenty that was a departure from the Dixieland material that he was generally associated with. Covering an eclectic variety of popular, standard and show tunes, it featured a big-band supplemented by timpani, French horns and harp. He also appeared opposite Troy Donahue and Suzanne Phlesette in the 1962 motion picture, \"Rome Adventure.\"\\n\\nIn 1965, he hosted the hour-long television variety series Fanfare, which aired on CBS as a summer replacement for Jackie Gleason and the American Scene Magazine.\\n\\nHirt starred along with the University of Arizona marching band at the first Super Bowl halftime show in 1967.\\n\\nOn February 8, 1970, while performing in a Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans, Hirt was injured while riding on a float. It is popularly believed that he was struck in the mouth by a thrown piece of concrete or brick. Factual documentation of the details of the incident is sparse, consisting primarily of claims made by Hirt after the incident. Whatever the actual cause of his injuries, Hirt underwent surgery and made a return to the club scene. This incident was parodied in a Saturday Night Live skit from their second season Mardi Gras special, the \"Let\\'s Hit Al Hirt in the Mouth with a Brick Contest\".\\n\\nIn 1987, Hirt played a solo rendition of \"Ave Maria\" for Pope John Paul II\\'s visit to New Orleans. He is referred to in the 1987 film Good Morning, Vietnam, in a broadcast made by Lieutenant Hauk (Bruno Kirby).\\n\\nHirt died of liver failure at the age of 76, after having spent the previous year in a wheelchair due to edema in his leg.

Casey composed the well-known tune \"Buck Jumpin\", which was recorded by Waller.\\nCasey was born in Louisville, Kentucky to Joseph and Maggie B. Johnson Casey. He grew up in New York City and attended DeWitt Clinton High School. He joined Thomas Fats Waller\\'s band in the early 1930s and can be heard on hundreds of recordings, working with him until Waller died in 1943. In 1944, Casey briefly recorded with Louis Armstrong. He also worked with Clarence Profit\\'s band that same year. In 1959 he contributed to an album called Paul Curry Presents The Friends Of Fats on the Golden Crest label.[citation needed]\\nBetween stints with Waller, Casey worked with Teddy Wilson from 1939 to 1940. He recorded with Billie Holiday, Frankie Newton, and Chuck Berry, and even led his own a trio for a short time. Remembering his time, years later, working with Holiday, Casey commented that he was in love with her.\\nCasey freelanced over decades working with King Curtis from 1957 to 1961, where he played rhythm and blues. He continued playing into his late eighties with The Harlem Blues & Jazz Band, which he joined in 1981.\\nHe died four days before his ninetieth birthday of colon cancer at the Dewitt Rehabilitation and Nursing Center in New York.\\n\\n#2 - Alvin W. Casey (October 26, 1936 – September 17, 2006) was an American guitarist. He was mainly noted for his work as a session musician, but also released his own records and scored three Billboard Hot 100 hits in the United States. His contribution to the rockabilly genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.\\n\\nAl is mainly known for his studio backup work, but also released records and had minor chart success under his own name. His guitar is prominent on the Sanford Clark hit The Fool, featuring a lick Al borrowed from the song, \"Smokestack Lightning\". He was part of the backup for Duane Eddy\\'s recordings, playing bass, piano, and rhythm guitar.\\n\\nAl and Lee Hazlewood worked together in 1963, recording Surfin Hootenanny, which was a chart success. (The backup vocal group was even named The K-C-Ettes.) Recorded in the style of Duane Eddy\\'s Dance with the Guitar Man, \"Surfin Hootenanny\" featured Al mimicking the styles of Dick Dale, The Ventures, and Duane Eddy. The Surfin Hootenanny album is somewhat of a classic among surf and rock and roll fans.

       " 'Reverend Albert Green (born April 13 1946 in Forrest City, Arkansas) is an American Grammy award winning soul and gospel singer who enjoyed great popularity in the 70s with hit singles such as \"Let\\'s Stay Together\", Tired of Being Alone\", and \"You Oughta Be With Me\". Green has boasted a voice capable of both fluid high streams of sugar and deep south growls and rasps. He has sold over 20 million records worldwide, and he was also inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, being referred to as \"one of the most gifted purveyors of soul music.\"\\n\\nGreen was born in Forrest City, Arkansas.  He started performing at age ten in a Forrest City quartet called the Greene Brothers; he dropped the final \"E\" from his last name years later as a solo artist. They toured extensively in the mid-1950s in the South until the Greenes moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan, when they began to tour around Michigan. His father kicked him out of the group because he caught Green listening to Jackie Wilson.\\n\\nIn 1967 at the age of 16, Al formed an R&B group, Al Green & the Creations, with several of his high-school friends. Two Creation members, Curtis Rogers and Palmer James, founded their own independent record company, Hot Line Music Journal, and had the group record for the label. By that time, the Creations had been re-named the Soul Mates. The group\\'s first single, \"Back Up Train,\" became a surprise hit, climbing to number five on the R&B charts early in 1968. The Soul Mates attempted to record another hit, but all of their subsequent singles failed to find an audience. In 1969, Al Green met bandleader and Hi Records vice president Willie Mitchell while on tour in Midland, Texas. Impressed with Green\\'s voice, he signed the singer to Hi Records, and began collaborating with Al on his debut album\\n\\nHe was perhaps the ideal complement to the orchestral, syrupy, strong soul production work of Hi Records wizard Willie Mitchell, who also helmed 70s classics for Syl Johnson, Ann Peebles, and himself.\\n\\nOn October 18, 1974, Mary Woodson, a woman who was his longtime girlfriend, threw a large pot of sticky boiling grits on him as he was preparing to shower, because he didn\\'t want to get married. She committed suicide in minutes, which deeply affected Green to turn to God and religion. This assault from behind caused third-degree burns on his back, stomach and arm. Deeply shaken, Green continued to reaffirm and grow closer to his deeply held love for God, and became an ordained pastor of the Full Gospel Tabernacle in Memphis in 1976. \\nContinuing to record R&B, Green saw his sales start to slip and drew mixed reviews from critics. 1977\\'s The Belle Album was critically acclaimed but did not regain his former mass audience. In 1979 Green injured himself falling off the stage while performing in Cincinnati and interpreted this as a message from God. He then concentrated his energies towards pastoring his church and gospel singing, also appearing in 1982 with Patti Labelle in the Broadway musical Your Arms Too Short to Box with God. According to Glide Magazine, \"by the late 70s, he had begun concentrating almost exclusively on gospel music.\" His first gospel album was The Lord Will Make a Way. From 1981 to 1989 Green recorded a series of gospel recordings, garnering eight \"soul gospel performance\" Grammys in that period. In 1985, he reunited with Willie Mitchell along with Angelo Earl for He Is the Light, his first album for A&M Records. In 1984, director Robert Mugge released a documentary film, Gospel According to Al Green, including interviews about his life and footage from his church. In 1989, Green released \"I Get Joy\", again with producer/guitarist Angelo Earl. In 2001, he appeared in the movie and soundtrack of On the Line featuring Lance Bass.\\n\\nAfter spending several years exclusively performing gospel, Green began to return to Rhythm & Blues. First, he released a duet with Annie Lennox, \"Put a Little Love in Your Heart\" for Scrooged, a 1988 Bill Murray film. In 1989 Green worked with producer Arthur Baker writing and producing the international hit \"The Message Is Love\". In 1991 he created the introductory theme song for the short-lived television series Good Sports featuring Ryan O\\'Neal and Farrah Fawcett. In 1992, Green recorded again with Baker, the Fine Young Cannibals, and reunited with his former Memphis mix engineer (this time functioning as producer) Terry Manning, to release the album Don\\'t Look Back. His 1994 duet with country music singer Lyle Lovett blended country with R&B, garnering him his ninth Grammy, this time in a pop music category. Green\\'s first secular album in some time was Your Heart\\'s In Good Hands (1995), released to positive reviews but disappointing sales, the same year Green was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\\nIn 2000, Green published Take Me to the River, a book discussing his career. Green received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002.\\nIn 2001, Green\\'s live cover of Sam Cooke\\'s \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" was released on the soundtrack to Will Smith\\'s film Ali (the song plays when Muhammad Ali learns of the death of close friend Malcolm X).\\nBy 2003 Green released a non-religious (secular) album entitled I Can\\'t Stop, his first collaboration with Willie Mitchell since 1985\\'s He is the Light. In March 2005 he issued Everything\\'s OK as the follow-up to I Can\\'t Stop. Green also collaborated with Mitchell on this secular CD.\\n\\nThe title of Al Green\\'s latest album Lay It Down released May, 2008, truly tells it like it is. Conceived as a collaboration between the soul legend and a handful of gifted young admirers from the worlds of contemporary R&B and hip hop, the album is drawn from a series of inspired sessions that yielded the most high-spirited, funky and often lushly romantic songs of Green\\'s latter-day career.\\n\\nThe project features the sophisticated R&B voices of singer-songwriters John Legend, Anthony Hamilton and Corinne Bailey Rae, and it was co-produced with Green by two of hip-hop\\'s most innovative players, drummer Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson from the Roots and keyboardist  James Poyser , the go-to guy for high-profile artists ranging from Erykah Badu to Common.

After service with the U.S. Marines in World War II, including being a part of the Iwo Jima invasion where he was wounded, he commenced his singing career.\\n\\nHis single \"Here in My Heart\" was number one in the first UK Singles Chart, published by the New Musical Express in 1952, putting him into the Guinness Book of World Records. The song stayed there for nine weeks. Al Martino has stated that Mario Lanza dropped his plans to record this song after he called Lanza in Los Angeles and explained that his own recording would be neglected if he did so.\\n\\nOne of the most successful Martino hits was \"Spanish Eyes\", achieving several gold and platinum discs for sales. Recorded in 1965, the song reached number 5 on the UK Singles Chart when re-issued in 1973. Even today, this classic by composer Bert Kaempfert (his original title for the song was \"Moon Over Naples\") is among the 50 most-played songs worldwide. Another hit was \"Volare\", (also known as \"Nel blu, Dipinto di Blu\"). In 1976, it reached number one on the Italian and Flemish charts, and was in the Top Ten in Spain, The Netherlands and France, as well as in many other European countries.\\n\\nIn the U.S., Martino had eleven top 40 hits in the Billboard pop singles chart in the 1960s and 1970s, with 1963\\'s \"I Love You Because\" (#3) and 1964\\'s \"I Love You More and More Every Day\" (#9) both reaching the Top Ten. He also sang the title song for the film, \"Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte\" (1964), and is credited in the end titles of the film.\\n\\nApart from singing, Martino played the role of Johnny Fontane in the 1972 film The Godfather, as well as singing the film\\'s theme, \"Speak Softly Love\". He played the same role in The Godfather Part III and The Godfather Trilogy: 1901-1980. He recently returned to acting, playing aging crooner Sal Stevens in the short film \"Cutout\", appearing in film festivals around the world in 2006.\\n\\nWhen an artist is able to combine several important elements -- numerous international hit records, personal charisma, and a unique vocal style -- it inevitably leads to success. Known for such hits as \"Spanish Eyes\" and \"Can\\'t Help Falling in Love\" in the 60\\'s, Al Martino was in the midst of beginning his second career, which had already taken off with great momentum in the European market.

According to  Songfacts, in days of youthful folly Stewart played in a beat group with later BBC DJ Tony Blackburn before moving to the capital to seek fortune and fame.\\n\\nHaving bought his first guitar from future Police guitarist Andy Summers, Stewart traded in his electric guitar for an acoustic guitar when he was offered a weekly slot at Bunjies Coffee House in London\\'s Soho in 1965. From there, he went on to compete at the Les Cousins folk club on Greek Street, where he played alongside Cat Stevens, Bert Jansch, Van Morrison, Roy Harper and Ralph McTell\\n\\nAlthough he had his share of the breaks, including a tenure at Bunjees coffee house and a record deal with CBS, life wasn\\'t always easy for the young troubadour; his first serious love affair ended in disaster, and he experienced all the usual insecurities of the stranger in the big city trying to find his way.\\n\\nIn January 1970, Melody Maker named his second release Love Chronicles its Folk Album Of The Year, but in spite of his obviously carving out quite a name for himself, it was not until Year Of The Cat  - the single and even more so the monster album - that he really shot to fame.\\n\\nHe emigrated to the United States as his career took off in the mid 1970s, and still lives in California. While studio albums are now few and far between, he still tours extensively in the United States, and, most years, in Europe. Recordings of concerts are often made available through his fan clubs. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Al+Stewart\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Allen LaMar \"Al\" Wilson (June 19, 1939 – April 21, 2008) was an American soul singer best known for the hit song \"Show and Tell\", and in the UK for the earlier hit, \"The Snake\"\\n\\nWilson was born in Meridian, Mississippi. He showed little interest in education but performed in school plays, sang in talent shows and won first prize in a local art contest. Wilson began his career at the age of 12 leading his own spiritual quartet and singing in the church choir, even performing covers of country and western hits as circumstances dictated. While he was in high school, Wilson and his family relocated to San Bernardino, California, where he worked odd jobs as a mail carrier, a janitor, and an office clerk, in addition to teaching himself to play drums; after graduation he spent four years touring with Johnny Harris and the Statesmen before joining the U.S. Navy and singing with an enlisted men\\'s chorus. He also developed his stand-up comedy routine to fall back on in case he didn\\'t make it as a singer.\\n\\nAfter a two-year military stint, Wilson settled in Los Angeles, touring the local nightclub circuit before joining the R&B vocal group the Jewels; from there he landed with the Rollers, followed by a stint with the instrumental combo the Souls. In 1966, Wilson signed with manager Marc Gordon, who quickly scored his client an a cappella audition for Johnny Rivers — the \"Secret Agent Man\" singer not only signed Wilson to his Soul City imprint, but also agreed to produce the sessions that yielded the 1968 R&B smash \"The Snake\" (U.S. #27),which has been very popular on the Northern Soul music circuit in the UK; it also provided Wilson with his only British chart hit, reaching number 41 in 1975. The minor hit \"Do What You Gotta Do\" appeared that same year. In 1969, Wilson charted with his cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival\\'s \"Lodi\" (U.S. #67), and Rivers\\' own \"Poor Side Of Town\" (U.S. #75).\\n\\nWilson largely disappeared from sight until 1973, when he issued the platinum-selling Show And Tell — the album\\'s success was spurred by the shimmering \"Show and Tell\", a Johnny Mathis castoff that sold well over a million copies.\\n\\n\"The La La Peace Song\", released in 1974, proved another hit but caused some trouble as OC Smith had also recorded a version around the same time and sales suffered as a result. Two years later in 1976 he recorded \"I\\'ve Got a Feeling We\\'ll Be Seeing Each Other Again\" for Playboy Records which cracked the R&B Top Three. He tried to leave Playboy Records but was unable to get a release from his contract. Two years later the label folded. With 1979\\'s \"Count the Days\" Wilson scored his final chart hit, however, and he spent the next two decades touring clubs and lounges; in 2001 he re-recorded his classic hits for the album Spice of Life.\\n\\nIn March 2007 many of his original master tapes were lost to a fire that swept through his home garage he had converted into a recording studio.\\n\\nWilson died April 21, 2008 of kidney failure, in Fontana, California at the age of 68. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Al+Wilson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Alain Barrière (born Alain Bellec, 18 November 1935 in La Trinité-sur-Mer, Morbihan) - † 18. December 2019 in Carnac, Bretagne a French singer, who has been active since the 1950s and is known for participating in the 1963 Eurovision Song Contest with the song Elle était si jolie.\\n\\nAfter growing up in a small town on the coast of Brittany, in 1955 Barrière enrolled in the École nationale supérieure d\\'arts et métiers in Angers. As a student he bought a guitar and started to write songs. On graduating in engineering in 1960, he moved to Paris to take up employment, and started to perform in the evenings at small clubs around the capital. He won a song contest in 1961 with the self-penned song \"Cathy\"; his style was chanson-based with no concession to the burgeoning yé-yé scene, but nonetheless he was soon signed to a recording contract and started to release singles regularly, enabling him to give up his job and make at least a modest living from music.\\n\\nIn 1963, Barrière was chosen to represent France at the eighth Eurovision Song Contest in London. His song Elle était si jolie came 5th out of the 13 entries.\\n\\nElle était si jolie turned out to be by far the biggest seller of Barrière\\'s career to that point. He released his first album, Ma vie, in 1964 and the title-track, Ma Vie became a huge hit. In 1965 he was offered, and accepted, a leading role in a heist thriller, \"Pas de panique\", alongside Pierre Brasseur. This would be his only venture into acting, but his singing career reached its peak in the latter part of the decade with a string of hits making him one of France\\'s biggest stars and a sell-out live attraction.\\n\\nBarrière had gained a reputation for being uncompromising and at times difficult to work with. In the early 1970s he left his record company to set up his own label. He kept his fanbase, which ensured his records and concerts continued to provide a good living, despite his being overlooked by sections of the French broadcast media. \"Tu t\\'en vas\", a 1975 duet with fellow Eurovision veteran Noëlle Cordier, topped the French chart, and was the third biggest-selling single of the year in Switzerland.\\n\\nBarrière married in 1975 and he and his wife opened a nightclub-restaurant in a converted castle in Brittany. Although it proved a successful and popular venue, Barrière soon found himself facing severe tax problems, a result of dubious advice. In 1977 he took his family to the USA, where they remained for four years.\\n\\nAfter spending four years living in the USA, Barrière returned to france in 1981 and made several comeback attempts, to little avail. After another period spent overseas, this time in Quebec, the family were back in Brittany when Barrière\\'s career was unexpectedly rejuvenated by the 1997 release of a CD containing remastered versions of his old hits, which proved to be a money-spinner. Shortly afterwards, Barrière released an album of new material, which also sold well.\\n\\nHe published an autobiography in 2006 and continues to release both retrospective and newly-recorded albums.\\n\\nhttp://www.alainbarriere.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Alain+Barri%C3%A8re\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His music can best be described as hip-hop reggae with a dance hall style.\\n\\nDr. Alban (born August 26, 1957 as Alban Nwapa in Nigeria) grew up listening to Fela Kuti and James Brown. At age 23, he began studying dentistry. In order to be able to finance his university studies the music-loving medical student started making his own music. During this time Alban worked as a DJ in the well known Stockholm club \\'Alphabet Street\\'. Very quickly his name became widely known, especially since Alban often sang to the records he put on the turntable as a DJ. DJ René couldn\\'t help but notice him and so the highly intelligent medical student was discovered. But first Alban finished his studies and even opened his own dentistry practice.\\n\\nIn 1990, he met Denniz PoP from the SweMix label. Alban laid aside his dentist\\'s drill and realised his dream. Together with Denniz and Rap-Queen Leila K, his first record, Hello Africa - his declaration of love for his African home - broke all records. Alban Nwapa became Dr. Alban. His debut-album Hello Africa sold roughly 1 million copies world-wide.\\n\\nOne year later this success was surpassed by the second album One Love. 1.6 million singles of the song It\\'s My Life were sold (the single was even used as background music for a Tampax advert).\\nThe album immediately sold over 1.7 million units.

All in all, Dr. Alban can look back on world-wide sales of over 5 million albums and over 6 million singles, which resulted in 7 times Silver, 30 times Gold and 30 times Platinum. His hit No Coke was even used to illustrate an anti-drugs campaign in Sweden.\\n\\nAfter a re-release of No Coke, Dr. Alban confirmed his Euro dance style with his hits Look Who\\'s Talking and Let The Beat Go On.\\n\\nHe created his own record company \\'dr.records\\', on which he released Born in Africa, the first CD recorded completely in his studios.

       " 'Albert King (April 25, 1923 – December 21, 1992) was an American blues guitarist and singer.\\n\\nOne of the \"Three Kings of the Blues Guitar\" (along with B.B. King and Freddie King), Albert King stood 6\\' 4\", weighed 250 lbs and was known as \"The Velvet Bulldozer\". He was born Albert Nelson on a cotton plantation in Indianola, Mississippi. During his childhood he would sing at a family gospel group at a church. One of 13 children, King grew up picking cotton on plantations near Forrest City, Arkansas where the family moved when he was eight years old. He began his professional work as a musician with a group called In The Groove Boys in Osceola, Arkansas. He had also briefly played drums for Jimmy Reed\\'s band and on several early Reed recordings. Influenced by blues musicians Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lonnie Johnson, but also interestingly Hawaiian music, the electric guitar became his signature instrument, his preference being the Gibson Flying V, which he named \"Lucy\".\\n\\nKing was a left-handed \"upside-down/backwards\" guitarist. He was left-handed, but usually played right-handed guitars flipped over upside-down so the low E string was on the bottom. In later years he played a custom-made guitar that was basically left-handed, but had the strings reversed (as he was used to playing). He also used very unorthodox tunings (i.e., tuning as low as C to allow him to make sweeping string bends). Some believe that he was using open E minor tuning (C-B-E-G-B-E) or open F tuning (C-F-C-F-A-D). A \"less is more\" type blues player, he was known for his expressive \"bending\" of notes, a technique characteristic of blues guitarists.\\n\\nHe recorded his first record in 1953 for Parrot Records in Chicago, but it had no impact. His first minor hit came in 1959 with Lonely Man written by Bobbin Records A&R man and fellow guitar hero Little Milton, responsible for King\\'s signing with the label. However, it was not until his 1961 release Don\\'t Throw Your Love on Me So Strong that he had a major hit, reaching number fourteen on the U.S. Billboard  R&B chart. In 1966 he signed with the Stax record label. Produced by Al Jackson, Jr., King with Booker T. & the MG\\'s recorded dozens of influential sides, such as Crosscut Saw and As The Years Go Passing By, and in 1967 Stax released the album, Born Under a Bad Sign. The title track of that album (written by Booker T. Jones and William Bell) became King\\'s best known songs and has been covered by many other artists.\\n\\nAnother landmark album followed in Live Wire/Blues Power from one of many dates King played at promoter Bill Graham\\'s Fillmore venues. It had a wide and long-term influence on Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Robbie Robertson, and later Gary Moore and Stevie Ray Vaughan (Criminal World, on David Bowie\\'s 1983 release Let\\'s Dance, features a guitar solo copied note-for-note from his hero Albert King by young session musician Stevie Ray Vaughan).\\n\\nIn the 1970s, King was teamed with members of The Bar-Kays and The Movement (Isaac Hayes\\'s backing group), including bassist James Alexander and drummer Willie Hall adding strong funk elements to his music. Adding strings and multiple rhythm guitarists, producers Allen Jones and Henry Bush created a wall of sound that contrasted the sparse, punchy records King made with Booker T. & the MG\\'s. Among these was another of King\\'s signature tunes with I\\'ll Play the Blues For You in 1972.\\n\\nRecorded in December 1983, In Session captures an in-concert jam between Albert King and Stevie Ray Vaughan\\nAs he hit his mid-sixties King began to muse about retirement, not unreasonable given that he had health problems. Nevertheless, when near to death, he was planning yet another overseas tour.\\nKing died on December 21, 1992 from a heart attack in Memphis, Tennessee. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Albert+King\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Aldo Nova (born Aldo Caporuscio in Montreal on 13 November 1956) is a Canadian guitarist, keyboardist, vocalist, songwriter, and producer. Nova initially gained fame with his self-titled debut album Aldo Nova in 1982 which climbed to US Billboard\\'s number 8 position, and its accompanying single, \"Fantasy\", which climbed to number 23 on the US Billboard Hot 100. \\n\\nHis eponymous debut album from 1982 is said to have provided a blueprint for the hard rock of the \\'80s. During the \\'80s and \\'90s, he worked with fellow hard rockers Lita Ford and Jon Bon Jovi -- he contributed heavily to the latter\\'s 1990 solo debut Blaze of Glory -- as mainstream rock began to adapt his innovations. Nova found his greatest commercial success as a songwriter and producer for Celine Dion, earning a Grammy for her 1996 album Falling Into You. This success allowed Nova to be picky with his projects, but he eventually returned to his own recording career in 2018 with the release of 2.0.\\n\\nNova learned guitar when he was 15 years old, inspired equally by Jimi Hendrix and jazz. While he cut his teeth in local clubs, he also played George Harrison in a production of Beatlemania, spending his extra hours working as a studio engineer. Eventually, he landed a publishing deal, which led to a 1982 contract with Portrait Records.\\n\\nPortrait allowed Nova to produce his own 1982 debut, which resulted in the album sounding unlike most other hard rock on the radio at that time. \"Fantasy\" hit at precisely the right moment, burning up the AOR rock charts but also receiving heavy play on MTV. This helped \"Fantasy\" reach the Billboard Top 40, climbing to number 23 while making it all the way to three on their Mainstream Rock chart. The album\\'s second single, the power ballad \"Fooling Yourself,\" reached 65 on the Hot 100, but Aldo Nova had legs, earning its first platinum certification in 1989 and a second in 1994.\\n\\nNova had a difficult time capitalizing on this success. On his 1983 sequel Subject…Aldo Nova, the guitarist ratcheted up the synthesizers and tied together the songs with a vague concept, conceits that made the album feel vaguely New Wave. \"Monkey on Your Back,\" the album\\'s lead single, went to 12 on Billboard\\'s Mainstream Rock chart, but \"Always Be Mine\" couldn\\'t get past 107. The album nevertheless managed to earn Gold certification in 1994. The record label intervened during the recording of 1985\\'s Twitch to help steer him back onto the charts but it didn\\'t help: the album stiffed upon its release. After its commercial failure, Nova asked to be let out of his contract with Portrait; his time with the label would be wrapped up with the release of the 1991 compilation, A Portrait of Aldo Nova.\\n\\nAt that point, Nova decided to recede from the spotlight. He chose to work as a session musician, producer, and professional songwriter, areas where he was experienced. During his ascent on the charts, he appeared on records by Michael Bolton and Blue Oyster Cult, but by 1984, he also was working on records by Lita Ford and Bon Jovi. The latter proved to be a crucial connection. In 1990, he played on Jon Bon Jovi\\'s solo debut, Blaze of Glory, where he helped come up with the title track\\'s lead riff. Bon Jovi had a history with Nova -- Nova appears on the 1984 debut by Jon\\'s band -- and the rocker paid it forward six years later, signing Nova to his Jambco imprint and releasing Blood on the Bricks, but the record didn\\'t go anywhere commercially, nor did the 1997 album Nova\\'s Dream.\\n\\nOf greater importance to Nova in the late 1990s was his collaboration with Celine Dion. He worked with the singer on some of her first albums, co-writing the song \"A New Day Has Come,\" and the collaboration continued through her 1996 album Falling Into You. He produced part of the album, taking home a Grammy Award when it won Album of the Year in 1996. Another Grammy arrived when he worked with Latin rock group La Ley on Uno, which won the Grammy for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album in 2001. In 2003, he co-wrote \"This Is the Night,\" which became a hit for Clay Aiken after he won American Idol.\\n\\nNova was firmly a behind-the-scenes artist by the 2000s, working as a producer and songwriter, toiling away on a rock opera called The Life and Times of Eddie Gage for the better part of a decade. Instead of releasing that, Nova mounted a comeback in 2018 with 2.0, an album where he offered new versions of his old hits. \\n\\nHis album \"The Life and Times of Eddie Gage\" was released in 2022. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Aldo+Nova\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The story of who was born into a totally Christian environment and who years later would become a pop music star. Muse of those who feel different or excluded, Katy Perry got her first guitar (from the church) at the age of thirteen and dreamed of it, as many young people do. The difference is that she did it. She broke free from the shackles of faith (without ever losing it) and set out to live through songs about her experiences. The result? Aside from Michael Jackson, only she was able to place five songs from the same album at the top of the charts.\\n\\n After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued a career in gospel music as a teenager. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and released her debut studio album Katy Hudson under her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles the following year to venture into secular music after Red Hill ceased operations and she subsequently began working with producers Glen Ballard, Dr. Luke, and Max Martin. After adopting the stage name \\'Katy Perry\\' and being dropped by The Island Def Jam Music Group and Columbia Records, she signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in April 2007.\\n\\nPerry rose to fame in 2008 with her second album, One of the Boys, a pop rock record containing the controversial U.S number one song \"I Kissed a Girl\" and \"Hot n Cold\". Three subsequent albums have topped the U.S. Billboard 200. The disco-influenced Teenage Dream (2010) spawned five chart-topping U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles–\"California Gurls\", \"Teenage Dream\", \"Firework\", \"E.T.\", and \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" — a record tying her with Michael Jackson\\'s \"Bad\". Its follow-up record Prism (2013) was inspired by her divorce, and incorporates pop and dance along with themes of self-reflection, everyday life, and relationships. With the music videos for its chart-topping songs \"Roar\" and \"Dark Horse\", Perry became the first artist to have multiple videos reach one billion views on Vevo.  Her 2017 electropop album,  \\'Witness\\' featured a political subtext and a theme of liberation. Her sixth studio album \\'Smile\\' followed in 2020.\\n\\nPerry has nine U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number one singles and has received various awards, including four Guinness World Records, five Billboard Music Awards, five American Music Awards, a Brit Award, and a Juno Award.

The musician was raised in Phoenix, Arizona until his family moved to California when he was in high school. With guitar, piano, and drums already in his repertoire, the singer would perform on the streets of oceanside Santa Monica around the time he started his own YouTube channel in 2012. It quickly found an audience with his early mix of vlog entries, which proved him to be at ease on camera, and acoustic-guitar covers of the likes of Drake and Katy Perry. He also premiered original songs in the sphere of R&B-influenced teen pop, such as \"Alphabet Song\" and \"Doesn\\'t Get Better,\" both from 2013. His original songs quickly came to the attention of other musicians, and that same year he was invited to spend two months touring the U.S. and Canada in support of teen pop band R5. Just days after leaving that tour, he premiered the song \"Young & Foolish,\" which was co-written by superstar John Legend. He was also invited to collaborate with another major-league songwriter, Babyface, and, at 17, signed with BMG Publishing.\\n\\nAiono continued to work on his music and contribute regularly to his video channel while also pursuing acting, and starred in the web series Royal Crush, which began its run in 2014. Some of his most popular song covers around that time included the Weeknd\\'s \"The Hills\" and Shawn Mendes\\' \"Stitches,\" both posted in 2015.

       " 'James Joseph Brown (May 3, 1933 – December 25, 2006) was an American entertainer, record producer, and bandleader. The central progenitor of funk music and a major figure of 20th century music, he is often referred to by the honorific nicknames \"the Hardest Working Man in Show Business\", \"Godfather of Soul\", \"Mr. Dynamite\", and \"Soul Brother No. 1\". In a career that lasted more than 50 years, he influenced the development of several music genres. Brown was one of the first 10 inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at its inaugural induction in New York on January 23, 1986.\\n\\nBrown began his career as a gospel singer in Toccoa, Georgia. He first came to national public attention in the mid-1950s as the lead singer of the Famous Flames, a rhythm and blues vocal group founded by Bobby Byrd. With the hit ballads \"Please, Please, Please\" and \"Try Me\", Brown built a reputation as a dynamic live performer with the Famous Flames and his backing band, sometimes known as the James Brown Band or the James Brown Orchestra. His success peaked in the 1960s with the live album Live at the Apollo and hit singles such as \"Papa\\'s Got a Brand New Bag\", \"I Got You (I Feel Good)\" and \"It\\'s a Man\\'s Man\\'s Man\\'s World\".\\n\\nDuring the late 1960s, Brown moved from a continuum of blues and gospel-based forms and styles to a profoundly \"Africanized\" approach to music-making, emphasizing stripped-down interlocking rhythms that influenced the development of funk music. By the early 1970s, Brown had fully established the funk sound after the formation of the J.B.s with records such as \"Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine\" and \"The Payback\". He also became noted for songs of social commentary, including the 1968 hit \"Say It Loud - I\\'m Black and I\\'m Proud\". Brown continued to perform and record until his death from pneumonia in 2006.\\n\\nBrown recorded 17 singles that reached No. 1 on the Billboard R&B charts. He also holds the record for the most singles listed on the Billboard Hot 100 chart that did not reach No. 1. Brown was posthumously inducted into the first class of the Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2013 as an artist and then in 2017 as a songwriter. He also received honors from several other institutions, including inductions into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame, and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In Joel Whitburn\\'s analysis of the Billboard R&B charts from 1942 to 2010, Brown is ranked No. 1 in The Top 500 Artists. He is ranked seventh on Rolling Stone\\'s list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\\n\\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Brown\\n\\nStudio albums\\nPlease Please Please (1958)\\nTry Me!

He was a co-founder of the indie hip hop record label Anticon.\\n\\n3) Alias, born in Portland, Maine to a jazz drummer and a church organist, grew up in a suburb called Hollis and played drums in his high school band. Isolated in a small town, alias found no music that captivated him until at age 13 when he saw \"Yo MTV Raps.\" Alone in his interest in hiphop, alias sought to immerse himself in this foreign counter-culture. He bought The Source monthly at the one shop in Maine that carried it, and by age 14 he was writing his own raps. In support of his new found passion, his parents bought him a drum machine for Christmas, and alias rapped over his own beats in the privacy of his bedroom, too shy to share his rhymes with anyone. \\n\\nHowever, in 1993, upon meeting Sole, who was already recording and doing shows, alias began rapping in ciphers at parties. He moved his \"studio\" from his bedroom to a friend\\'s basement where he taught himself to use an MPC 3000 and an ADAT machine. In \\'96 he started doing shows with The Live Poets (sole\\'s group) around New England.\\n\\nIn \\'98 during the deep puddle dynamics sessions in Minneapolis with Slug, dose and sole, alias realized that music would be his life\\'s work. Now taking himself seriously as a rapper and producer, he moved with the first wave of the anticon West Coast migration into a warehouse in East Oakland with his wife Jen and sole. Within a year he had recorded the other side of the looking glass, his first solo release, a rap-heavy introspective opus. alias found himself drawn more towards production while working on tracks for sole\\'s selling live water album, and in 2002-03 he recorded his first instrumental project, the eyes closed ep (out now) which anticipates the upcoming muted full-length (oct 2003).\\n\\nAlias has collaborated with every member of the anticon roster, Slug of Atmosphere, Sage Francis, DJ Krush, and Markus Acher of the Notwist. He has toured the world, performing with such acts as The Roots, Dalek, Freestyle Fellowship, and Kid 606. \\n\\n4) Alias was A UK grime and dark garage producer.\\n\\n5) Alias was a Southern Rock band featuring members of Lynyrd Skynyrd and Rossington Collins Band.

Abrams which was broadcast on ABC for five seasons, from September 30, 2001 to May 22, 2006. It starred Jennifer Garner as Sydney Bristow, a CIA agent.\\n\\nThe main theme of the series explores Sydney\\'s obligation to conceal her true career from her friends and family, even as she assumes multiple aliases to carry out her missions. These themes are most prevalent in the first two seasons of the show. A major plotline of the series was the search for and recovery of artifacts created by Milo Rambaldi, a fictional Leonardo da Vinci-like inventor and Nostradamus-like prophet from the Renaissance period.

       " 'David Robert Jones (8 January 1947 – 10 January 2016), known professionally as David Bowie, was an English singer-songwriter and actor. A leading figure in the music industry, he is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. Bowie was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, and his music and stagecraft had a significant impact on popular music.\\n\\nBowie developed an interest in music from an early age. He studied art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. \"Space Oddity\", released in 1969, was his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of Bowie\\'s single \"Starman\" and album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie\\'s style shifted towards a sound he characterised as \"plastic soul\", initially alienating many of his UK fans but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the album Young Americans. In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film The Man Who Fell to Earth and released Station to Station. In 1977, he again changed direction with the electronic-inflected album Low, the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the \"Berlin Trilogy\". \"Heroes\" (1977) and Lodger (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\\n\\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had three number-one hits: the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and \"Under Pressure\" (a 1981 collaboration with Queen). He achieved massive commercial success in the 1980s starting with Let\\'s Dance (1983). Between 1988 and 1992, he fronted the hard rock band Tin Machine before resuming his solo career in 1993. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1983), Jareth the Goblin King in Labyrinth (1986), Pontius Pilate in The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), and Nikola Tesla in The Prestige (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with The Next Day. He remained musically active until his death from liver cancer at his home in New York City. He died two days after both his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, Blackstar (2016).\\n\\nDuring his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million records worldwide, made him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum, eleven gold and eight silver album certifications, and released 11 number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Rolling Stone ranked him among the greatest artists in history.

       " 'Alice Cooper (born Vincent Damon Furnier, February 4, 1948) is an American rock singer whose career spans over five decades. With a raspy voice and a stage show that features numerous props and stage illusions, including pyrotechnics, guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood, reptiles, baby dolls, and dueling swords, Cooper is considered by many music journalists and peers to be \"The Godfather of Shock Rock\". He has drawn equally from horror films, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock audiences.\\n\\nOriginating in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1964, \"Alice Cooper\" was originally a band with roots extending back to a band called the Earwigs, consisting of Furnier on lead vocals and harmonica, Glen Buxton on lead guitar, and Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar and backing vocals. By 1966, Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar joined the three and Neal Smith was added on drums in 1967. The five named the band \"Alice Cooper\", and Furnier eventually adopted it as his stage pseudonym. They released their 1969 debut studio album with limited chart success. Breaking out with the 1970 single \"I\\'m Eighteen\" and the third studio album Love It to Death, the band reached their commercial peak in 1973 with their sixth studio album, Billion Dollar Babies. After the band broke up, Furnier legally changed his name to Alice Cooper and began a solo career in 1975 with the concept album Welcome to My Nightmare. Over his career, Cooper has sold well over 50 million records.\\n\\nCooper has experimented with a number of musical styles, mainly hard rock, glam rock, heavy metal, and glam metal, but also new wave (1980–1983), art rock on DaDa (1983), and industrial rock on Brutal Planet (2000) and Dragontown (2001). He helped to shape the sound and look of heavy metal, and has been described as the artist who \"first introduced horror imagery to rock \\'n\\' roll, and whose stagecraft and showmanship have permanently transformed the genre\". He is also known for his wit offstage, with The Rolling Stone Album Guide calling him the world\\'s most \"beloved heavy metal entertainer\". Away from music, Cooper is a film actor, a golfing celebrity, a restaurateur, and, since 2004, a radio disc jockey (DJ) with his classic rock show Nights with Alice Cooper.\\n\\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Cooper\\n\\nBand studio albums\\nPretties for You (1969)\\nEasy Action (1970)\\nLove It to Death (1971)\\nKiller (1971)\\nSchool\\'s Out (1972)\\nBillion Dollar Babies (1973)\\nMuscle of Love (1973)\\n\\nSolo studio albums\\nWelcome to My Nightmare (1975)\\nAlice Cooper Goes to Hell (1976)\\nLace and Whiskey (1977)\\nFrom the Inside (1978)\\nFlush the Fashion (1980)\\nSpecial Forces (1981)\\nZipper Catches Skin (1982)\\nDaDa (1983)\\nConstrictor (1986)\\nRaise Your Fist and Yell (1987)\\nTrash (1989)\\nHey Stoopid (1991)\\nThe Last Temptation (1994)\\nBrutal Planet (2000)\\nDragontown (2001)\\nThe Eyes of Alice Cooper (2003)\\nDirty Diamonds (2005)\\nAlong Came a Spider (2008)\\nWelcome 2 My Nightmare (2011)\\nParanormal (2017)\\nDetroit Stories (2021) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Alice+Cooper\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Alicia Bridges (born July 13, 1953 in Lawndale, North Carolina) is an American singer who had an international hit single in 1978 with the song \"I Love the Nightlife (Disco \\'Round)\".\\n\\nIn 1977 she was signed with Polydor Records. Her 1978 hit single \"I Love the Nightlife (Disco Round)\" reached number five on the Billboard Hot 100 charts and was also charting on Billboard\\'s \"Hits of the World\" charts. The song was also #5 on the Record World and Cash Box charts consecutively. Alicia\\'s song was a \"crossover\", meaning it charted on more than one genre chart simultaneously, such as the dance tracks chart, pop charts, etc. The song was even played on country music stations.\\n\\nIn 1978 Alicia was a Grammy nominee and was the opening act for the awards show, performing \"I Love the Nightlife\". Alicia\\'s self titled LP \"Alicia Bridges\" was also rising on the Billboard, Cash Box and Record World charts and the LP remained on the charts for up to 35 weeks. Both the LP and the single release were international successes for Alicia and \"I Love The Nightlife\" landed at the top of the charts in France and Germany with notable chart numbers in the UK, where it peaked at Number 32 on the UK singles chart, Spain and other European countries. Alicia\\'s music was popular in Japan as well. Alicia received a RIAA Certified Gold Record for the sale of over one million copies of her hit single in the USA, as well as a gold record from Canada.\\n\\nEven by 1977, Alicia was already well-versed as a rock, blues and ballad singer. \"I Love The Nightlife\" has a definite back beat and organ similar to early 70s R&B. Alicia\\'s intention was to record the track as an R&B song. But it was the shrewd ear of publishing mogul Bill Lowery who first heard the song as a disco dance tune. Soon thereafter, Jim Burgess produced the 12\" single remix. Ultimately it became a worldwide hit. The song has been featured in several movies including \"Love At First Bite\", \"The Last Days of Disco\" and \"The Adventures of Priscilla, the Queen of the Desert\".\\n\\nAlicia\\'s second single, \"Body Heat\", was a rock song with strong electric guitar rhythms, reflecting her earlier experience singing in rock and other genres. Although \"I Love The Nightlife\" was the most notable hit from the \"Alicia Bridges\" LP, \"Broken Woman\", a blues/rock song, also found favor among many fans.\\n\\nIn November 2006, Alicia Bridges released a remixed and remastered compilation of her songs entitled, \"This Girl Don\\'t Care\". The CD jacket has three pink triangles as part of the design graphics as well as a pink triangle on the vest Alicia is wearing. Being \"out\" to the public for many years, Alicia has been a long-time supporter of the Gay and Lesbian communities. She has said that the re-mixed and remastered CD is especially for her gay family and friends, though it reaches out with a message for others as well.

Later that year, Keys released her novel Tears for Water: Songbook of Poems and Lyrics, a collection of unreleased poems from her journals and lyrics. The title derived from one of her poems, \"Love and Chains\" from the line: \"I don\\'t mind drinking my tears for water.\" She said the title is the foundation of her writing because \"everything I have ever written has stemmed from my tears of joy, of pain, of sorrow, of depression, even of question\". The book sold over US$500,000 and Keys made The New York Times bestseller list in 2005. The following year, she won a second consecutive award for Best R&B Video at the MTV Video Music Awards for the video Karma.

It remained at number one on the Billboard Hot Adult R&B Airplay for 11 weeks.\\n\\nKeys opened a recording studio in Long Island, New York, called The Oven Studios, which she co-owns with her production and songwriting partner Kerry \"Krucial\" Brothers. The studio was designed by renowned studio architect John Storyk of WSDG, designer of Jimi Hendrix\\' Electric Lady Studios. Keys and Brothers are the co-founders of KrucialKeys Enterprises, a production and songwriting team who assisted Keys in creating her albums as well as create music for other artists.\\n\\nIn 2006, Keys won three NAACP Image Awards, including Outstanding Female Artist and Outstanding Song for Unbreakable. She also received the Starlight Award by the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In October 2006, she played the voice of Mommy Martian in the \"Mission to Mars\" episode of the children\\'s television series The Backyardigans, in which she sang an original song, Almost Everything Is Boinga Here. That same year, Keys nearly suffered a mental breakdown. Her grandmother had died and her family was heavily dependent on her. She felt she needed to \"escape\" and went to Egypt for three weeks. She explained: \"That trip was definitely the most crucial thing I\\'ve ever done for myself in my life to date. It was a very difficult time that I was dealing with, and it just came to the point where I really needed to—basically, I just needed to run away, honestly. And I needed to get as far away as possible.\"\\n\\nKeys released her third studio album, As I Am, in November 2007; it debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 742,000 copies in its first week. It gained Keys her largest first week sales of her career and became her fourth consecutive number one album, tying her with Britney Spears for the most consecutive number-one debuts on the Billboard 200 by a female artist. The week became the second largest sales week of 2007 and the largest sales week for a female solo artist since singer Norah Jones\\' album Feels like Home in 2004.

In 2008, Keys was ranked in at number 80 the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists. She also received three nominations at the 2009 Grammy Awards and won Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for Superwoman.\\n\\nIn an interview with Blender magazine, Keys allegedly said \"\\'Gangsta rap\\' was a ploy to convince black people to kill each other, \\'gangsta rap\\' didn\\'t exist\" and went on to say that it was created by \"the government\". The magazine also claimed she said that Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. were \"essentially assassinated, their beefs stoked by the government and the media, to stop another great black leader from existing\". Keys later wrote a statement clarifying the issues and saying her words were misinterpreted. Later that year, Keys was criticized by anti-smoking campaigners after billboard posters for her forthcoming concerts in Indonesia featured a logo for the A Mild cigarette brand sponsored by tobacco firm Philip Morris. She apologized after discovering that the concert was sponsored by the firm and asked for \"corrective actions\". In response, the company withdrew its sponsorship.\\n\\nKeys collaborated with record producer Swizz Beatz to write and produce Million Dollar Bill for Whitney Houston\\'s seventh studio album, I Look to You.

Keys was ranked as the top R&B recording artist of the 2000–2009 decade by Billboard magazine and ranked at number five as artist of the decade, while her song, No One, was ranked at number six on the magazine\\'s songs of the decade. In the United Kingdom, The Element of Freedom became Keys\\' first album to top the UK Albums Chart.\\n\\nAccording to Songfacts, Keys said regarding the title of her fifth studio album, Girl On Fire. \"Before making this record, in some ways I felt like a lion locked in a cage. I felt like a girl misunderstood that no one really knew, I felt like it was time to stop making excuses for any part of my life that I wanted to change. Once I made that choice I became a Girl on Fire, the lion broke free!!\" The title track will be made available on iTunes and radio on September 4, 2012.\\n\\nIn May 2009, Swizz Beatz announced that he and Keys were romantically involved, and in May 2010, a representative for Keys and Swizz Beatz confirmed that they were engaged and expecting a child together. During the time of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the couple took part of a union and had the unborn child blessed in a Zulu ceremony, which took place in the Illovo suburb of South Africa. Keys and Swizz Beatz were married on the French island of Corsica on July 31, 2010.

       " 'Alison Krauss (born July 23, 1971) is an American bluegrass-country  singer, songwriter and fiddler. Signed to Rounder Records as a 14-year-old fiddler from Champaign, Illinois, she has become the most recognized face in contemporary bluegrass, a critically acclaimed artist who has brought modern sophistication to the genre while respecting its traditions. Songfacts reports that in 2011 Krauss recorded her first ever number one country album in her home country with Paper Airplane. She has also sold upwards of 11 million records and garnered 2 Oscar nominations as well as 26 Grammy® Awards, the most for any female artist in Grammy® history. \\n\\nAlso impressive is Krauss\\'s unwavering commitment to being an independent-label artist who has succeeded far beyond the scope of many major-label artists. She has circulated freely within pop, mainstream country and roots music circles, as a solo artist and with her long-time band Union Station, creating impeccably produced records that appeal to an equally wide-ranging and inquisitive audience. Krauss has continued doing things the old-fashioned way: following her heart and whatever path the music takes her on.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Alison+Krauss\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Alison Moyet (born Geneviève Alison Jane Moyet on 18 June 1961 - Billericay, Essex, England), is an English pop singer-songwriter noted for her bluesy voice.\\n\\nMoyet was born to a French father and English mother. She grew up in Basildon, where she attended school. After leaving school at 16, she worked as a shop worker and a piano tuner. She was involved in a number of punk rock, pub rock and blues bands in the South East Essex area during the late 1970s and early 1980s, including The Vandals and the Screamin\\' Ab Dabs, The Vicars, The Vandals (UK 1978) and The Little Roosters.\\n\\nHer mainstream pop career began in 1982 when she formed the electro-pop duo Yazoo with former Depeche Mode member Vince Clarke. The duo had several hits, including \"Situation\", \"Only You\", \"Don\\'t Go\" and recorded two albums, \"Upstairs At Eric\\'s\" and \"You And Me Both\". The group was notable for melding Clarke\\'s trademark electronic sounds with Moyet\\'s warm, soulful voice.\\n\\nIn 1983 Moyet and Clarke decided to disband Yazoo. While Clarke went on to form Erasure, Moyet signed to CBS (in part because it had been Janis Joplin\\'s label), and began her solo career.\\n\\nIn 1984 she released her debut album \"Alf\" (titled after her punk-era nickname). Alf included contributions by popular producers/songwriters Swain and Jolley, as well as a song, \"Invisible\", written by Motown legend Lamont Dozier. The record was a hit in Britain, reaching number one in the album charts. Alf spawned 3 hit singles, \"Love Resurrection\", \"Invisible\" and \"All Cried Out\". In the US, \"Invisible\" was a Top 40 hit (something Yazoo had never achieved).\\n\\nIn 1985 Moyet performed at the historic Live Aid concert, alongside Paul Young. She also released a single not featured on \"Alf\", a cover of the standard \"That Ole Devil Called Love.\" The single went to #2 on the UK singles chart. (At present, it remains Moyet\\'s highest-charting UK single.)\\n\\nIn 1986 Moyet had another big UK hit with the single \"Is This Love?,\" followed in 1987 by the album Raindancing. Raindancing spawned further hit singles, including a cover of Floy Joy\\'s \"Weak In The Presence of Beauty\" and \"Ordinary Girl\". In 1987, she scored another cover hit with \"Love Letters\"; the video for the song featured comedy duo French & Saunders.\\n\\nFollowing a period of personal and career evaluation Hoodoo was released in 1991. Hoodoo, which took several steps away from the glossy pop sheen of Raindancing and was a far earthier and more personal album. Compared to her earlier releases, Hoodoo received little label support and only minimal promotion. The album sold respectably in Britain, and was nominated for a Grammy for the single \"It Won\\'t Be Long.\" However, the release of Hoodoo marked the beginning of what was to become a long fight for Moyet to secure complete control of her artistic direction. Like many similar artists of Moyet\\'s calibre (including Aimee Mann and the late Kirsty MacColl), Moyet was reluctant to record a radio-friendly \"pop\" album simply for the sake of creating chart hits.\\n\\nMoyet\\'s next album Essex (1994) was also a source of controversy for her; in order for the album to be released, her label (now Sony) insisted that certain Essex tracks be re-recorded and re-produced, and that there be additional material remixed to create a more \\'commercial\\' package. The video for the single \"Whispering Your Name\" again featured Dawn French.\\n\\nFollowing the release of Essex, Sony released a greatest-hits compilation of Moyet\\'s work the following year. Singles entered the UK charts at number one. Following incredible CD success and a UK tour, Singles was re-issued as a double CD set which included \"No Overdubs\", a bonus live CD. Upon re-issue Singles again charted, this time in the top 20.\\n\\nDue to prolonged litigation with Sony, Moyet did not record or release a new studio album for over eight years after the release of Essex. During this time, however, Moyet recorded vocals for Tricky, Sylk-130, Ocean Colour Scene, The Lightning Seeds and King Britt, and was featured on the British leg of the Lilith Fair tour. 2001 saw the release of The Essential Alison Moyet CD.\\n\\nIn August 2002, after years of holding out and refusing to compromise, Moyet was finally released from her Sony contract. Moyet signed to Sanctuary Records and released her first studio album in eight years, Hometime, an album which Sony had refused to release. Hometime was produced by the Insects, who had also produced works by Goldfrapp and Massive Attack. The release of the CD launched Moyet into the top five best-selling female UK artists of 2002 and resulted in a Brit nomination for Best Female Vocal as well as a nomination for the Mercury Music Prize.\\n\\nMoyet\\'s following CD, Voice, an eclectic collection of covers, was released on 6 September 2004 and entered the UK charts at number seven. The album was later re-issued with a bonus track, \"Alfie.\" A companion DVD, One Blue Voice, was released in 2006. \\n\\nAfter signing with the W14 Music label in late 2006, Moyet released the all-original The Turn in October 2007. As of this writing (15 Sept 2008), Moyet will be touring North America for the first time in 14 years after the huge success of the Yazoo Reconnected Tour of 2008.\\n\\nwww.alisonmoyet.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Alison+Moyet\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Alizée Jacotey (born 21 August 1984 in Ajaccio, Corsica, France) is a famous French pop singer. She goes by the stage name Alizée (pronounced: /a.lɪ.ze/), the feminine form of alizé, the trade wind. She was discovered by Mylène Farmer, one of the most successful French pop singers, following her winning performance in the talent show, Graines de Star, in 1999. From 2000 until the year 2006 while collaborating with Mylène Farmer and  Laurent Boutonnat, Alizée released two successful albums and became a pop star inside and outside of France. She was then considered the protégée of Mylène Farmer. In 2006 she decided to end her collaboration with Farmer and one year later she released her third album,Psychedelices for the first time, without her artistic supervision. This album enjoyed limited success in France, but topped the charts(international) in Mexico.\\n\\nAlizée made her début with the single, Moi... Lolita on the 4 July 2000. It is her most successful single to date. It was a instant hit throughout most of Europe and parts of east Asia, reaching number one in several countries.  Alizée\\'s image was that of a seductive Lolita character, referring to the novel by Vladimir Nabokov. The video for the single showed Alizée as a village girl visiting a night-club. Four months after the single her debut album \"Gourmandises\" was released. The album written entirely by Farmer and Boutonnat, has sold over 1,3 million copies in France. It was certified Platinum in just three months by the SNEP. In 2001, the album was released internationally, and she became the highest-selling female French singer in 2001. The album went on to sell over 2 million copies worldwide. Farmer and Boutonnat kept a tight rein how the album was marketed and controlled the image in which Alizée was portrayed. In the mean time, Alizée gave very few interviews, and even when she did, they did not stretch beyond 20 minutes per journalist. Neither did she agree to any photoshoots.\\n\\nHer second single L\\'Alizé followed soon after. It was also successful giving her first number one in France, and gained some success internationally. The video of the \"sexily alliterative\" song shows Alizée amidst soap bubbles against a pink backdrop singing about herself. The video was shot in a studio in Brussels, which had a 25 metre by 10 metre painted canvas to serve as the background—with real bubbles. This single was followed up with another single from the same album - the title song, Gourmandises. The video, which shows a group of young boys and girls out on a picnic, was shot in a day. The last single from this album was Parler Tout Bas, which deals with the theme of dreams and a loss of innocence. In France, \"Parler tout bas\" was the third single followed by the release of \"Gourmandises\".\\n\\nIn 2003, Alizée returned with her second album \"Mes Courants Électriques\". With the release of this album, she changed her image from a \\'Lolita\\' to that of a more toned-down teenager. This album was also written by Farmer and Boutonnat. The style of the music didn\\'t change so much but the album was more critically acclaimed than the previous one. While it had much success in and outside France, worldwide it managed to sell 1.000.000 copies, less than its predecessor. The album has an international version featuring English versions of four tracks.\\n\\nThe first single from this album, Je N\\'ai Marre! was released in 2003. The music video for this shows Alizée in a glass cage, singing while having water splashed on her. The plexiglass cage, 3 by 3 meters in dimension, was constructed in a Parisian studio, and the shooting of the video took two days. An English-language version of this song, titled I\\'m Fed Up, was also released, and featured similar visuals for the music video. The other singles from this album were  J\\'ai pas Vingt ans and À contre-courant. Like Je N\\'ai Marre, J\\'ai Pas Vingt Ans, Youpidou and Amelie M\\'a Dit also had English versions. The video for J\\'ai Pas Vingt Ans (I\\'m Not Twenty) resembles the ambience of a concert with Alizée dancing in the midst of several other dancers. À Contre-courant, the last single from this album, was shot in an abandoned coal factory. Unlike the other two singles, there was no English-language rendition of this song.\\n\\nFollowing the release of her second studio album, Mes Courants Électriques, Alizée toured around France and had two performances in Belgium and Switzerland, during the second half of the year 2003. The tour started off with a performance on August 26, 2003 in Paris. It concluded with her performance on the eve of January 17, 2004 at the Le Zénith concert hall in Paris and had covered major cities including Lyon, Rouen, Lille, Grenoble and Dijon, among others.\\n\\nA live CD and DVD, titled \"Alizée En Concert\", comprising of selected performances from her tour, was launched a year later in the fall of 2004. The audio CD contained tracks, taken from her two studio albums. The DVD featured video footage of the same performances as on the CD, along with bonus footage of her rehearsals. The compilation was re-released in early 2007 in Mexico by Universal music as a CD+DVD release, following the featuring of the songs in local radio stations. With the re-release and renewed interest, the songs climbed up the music charts in the country. The album became a hit, peaking at number 4 in the International Chart on May 28, 2007, and number 8 on the main albums chart. En concert has a Gold certification for shipments over 50,000 copies only in Mexico.\\n\\nFollowing her marriage in late 2003, Alizée took a hiatus from singing and avoided appearing in the media. She welcomed her first child Annily in 2005. Her first television appearance in two years was on MTV France on February 18, 2006.\\n\\nAfter almost two years of fan speculation, on April 3, 2006, a handwritten message, signed Alizée, was received by the webmaster of the fansite Le Nid d\\'Alizée, stating that she is working on the third album.\\nOn July 7, 2006, the show Le JT de la musique on French TV channel \"Europe 2 TV\" reported that Alizée has separated from her former producer and song writer Mylène Farmer and was working on her third album. It was also reported that the lyrics of the new album were being penned by Jean Faulques. Her husband, Jérémy Châtelain produces a lot of the album. \\n\\nHer third album Psychédélices was released in December of 2007.  Despite the promotion it had moderate success in France, where it reached number 16 on the albums chart. The album only held its peak position for one week on each chart and fell in the second week. The album was more of a success in Mexico, it debuted at number 44 in the Mexican Top 100 Albums Chart. The album peaked at number 15 in the main chart and number 1 in the international chart. It has sold 300,000 copies so far. Many of her fans were disappointed by this album as it was not produced by Mylène Farmer and Laurent Boutonnat. The critics considered it as artistically inferior of her previous efforts.\\n\\nOnly one single was spawned in France from Psychédélices, called Mademoiselle Juliette. It missed the top 20 peaking at number 22. The second single release, Fifty-Sixty, peaked at number 65 in the Mexican single charts. In 2008 Alizée recorded a new studio version of Madonna\\'s hit single La Isla Bonita and was included on a special edition for her album, Psychédélices in Mexico. The song so far has gone on to become a hit becoming Alizée\\'s first top ten single on the national top ten airplay chart.\\n\\nFollowing the success of Alizée En Concert and Psychédélices in Mexico, her former label, Universal Music released a compilation album, titled Tout Alizée. The compilation peaked at No. 62 on the Mexico Top 100 Albums Chart and No.20 on the Mexican International Top 20 Albums Chart.\\n\\nDuring the Psychédélices tour, she had to cancel a tour date in Paris, stating that she was already working on her new album and it would sound different from all of her previous recordings. The album Une Enfant Du Siècle and was released in France on 29 March 2010. The theme of the album is the life of American model Edie Sedgwick from the birth till the death, based on the style of Andy Warhol. He isn\\'t mentioned in the lyrics but the album has many references on him. The album received positive reviews from critics. However it peaked at No.24 on the French Album Chart aswell as No.22 on the Mexican Albums Chart. The single Limelight was released as a teaser single, being uploaded on 15 February 2010 on British website Popjustice. The main single Les Collines was released on 26 April 2010. \\n\\nIn 2011, she and Jérémy Chatelain divorced.\\n\\nIn Spring 2012, Alizée announced a new album would be released. However Sony delayed the album to Autumn 2012. In the meantime she was featured on the single Clara veut la Lune by  Alain Chamfort.On 27 June 2012, Alizée announced on live chat that the first single, À cause de l\\'automne from the new album was to be released 28 June 2012. She also revealed that for the new album she was working with Jean-Jacques Goldman, BB Brunes and Thomas Boulard were also working on the album, The first music video was shot on 15 July 2012 and was released on 5 December 2012. The video features Alizée exploring the themes of autumn (i.e playing with autumn leaves and umbrellas). The first performance of the single was on RFM radio on 21 December 2012 where she sang the song in a live broadcast. It charted at 131 on the French Singles Chart. The album was yet again delayed to Spring 2013. In January, she revealed the artwork and name for the album, which is named 5. The album incorporates dance-pop,rock and ballads. This was her first album to not chart in the French Album Chart. \\n\\nIn 2014, following the success of her appearance (and win) on popular French tv show Danse avec les stars , she released her sixth studio album, Blonde on 23 June 2014. The single Blonde was released months earlier on 18 March 2014. The song peaked at No.63 while the album peaked at No.20. It was considered a commercial failure. \\n\\nAlizée now owns a dance studio in Ajaccio, Corsica with her now-husband Grégoire Lyonnet and welcomed a baby girl called Maggy Lyonnet on 24 November 2019. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Aliz%C3%A9e\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Allan Clarke (born Harold Allan Clarke, 5 April 1942, Salford, Lancashire) is a British singer who was one of the founding members of The Hollies.\\n\\nHe and his childhood friend, Graham Nash, began singing together in Manchester while still at school. In April 1963, they added Tony Hicks (lead guitar) (who replaced Vic Steele), along with the later additions of Bobby Elliott and Bernie Calvert (who would replace Eric Haydock on bass in 1966), became The Hollies formed in December 1962. Clarke was their lead vocalist, but also played occasional guitar and harmonica. In the UK they enjoyed 29 chart singles, 17 of which made the Top 10, with two - \"I\\'m Alive\" (1965) and \"He Ain\\'t Heavy, He\\'s My Brother\" (1988 re-issue) - reaching No. 1, the latter on re-release; it had originally been a top three hit in 1969.\\n\\nIn the US charts they achieved 23 chart singles, six of which hit the Top 10. Many of the group’s songs were co-written by Clarke, usually with Hicks and Nash, until the latter\\'s departure at the end of 1968. They used the pseudonym \"L. Ransford\" initially for their song-writing credits.\\n\\nKeen to launch a solo career due to Nash\\'s success in CSN, Clarke left the group in 1971, and was replaced by the Swedish singer Mikael Rickfors formerly with Bamboo. Clarke made three albums on his own - My Real Name Is \\'arold (1972), Headroom (1973), and Allan Clarke (1974). However, none of Clarke\\'s solo works had much acclaim.\\n\\nIronically, after Clarke left the Hollies, \"Long Cool Woman (in a Black Dress),\" a song from their 1971 album Distant Light, which he had co-written with songwriters Roger Cook and Roger Greenaway, and on which Clarke sang lead and played lead guitar, became an international hit, reaching No. 2 in the U.S. (their most successful single ever there) and No. 32 in the UK Singles Chart. However, the Hollies toured with the single instead of Clarke, despite lacking the song\\'s distinct edge.\\n\\nRickfors left the group and Clarke rejoined them in July 1973. Their first single with him back in the fold was another of his songs, \"The Day that Curly Billy Shot Down Crazy Sam McGee,\" a Top 40 hit that autumn, that used the same style as \"Long Cool Woman.\"\\n\\nClarke continued to record and release solo albums while remaining with the Hollies, although his solo career did not achieve much chart or single success. His next album was I\\'ve Got Time (1976). He also performed guest vocals on the 1977 album I Robot by The Alan Parsons Project (most notably, lead vocals on the FM-hit Breakdown). He left The Hollies for the second time in March 1978 and made I Wasn\\'t Born Yesterday (1978), but returned in August. Subsequent solo albums included Legendary Heroes (1979) with its UK title changed to The Only One when released in 1980. His final solo album was Reasons To Believe (1990).\\n\\nBy this time the Hollies\\' UK chart career was almost over; their run of hit singles culminated with \"The Air That I Breathe,\" No. 2 in 1974, which was followed by a long run of commercial failures, although they had several years of much-acclaimed concert tours throughout the world. The success of their live shows was captured in their album Live Hits recorded live at a two-night concert in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 1976.\\n\\nDuring Clarke\\'s solo period, he largely relied on outside material, and was one of the first acts in Britain to champion the work of Bruce Springsteen. Clarke recorded a cover version of \"Born to Run\" and \"Blinded by the Light.\" Ultimately, Clarke\\'s record label thought the lyrics of these songs were too obscure, thus his versions did not receive much attention; his version of \"Born to Run,\" although recorded a few months before Bruce Springsteen\\'s, was delayed upon its release, and not released until after Springsteen\\'s version, and \"Blinded by the Light\" was dropped altogether with Clarke giving Manfred Mann the go-ahead to record their own version. In this period, Clarke also used material of Lindsey Buckingham pre-Fleetwood Mac.\\n\\nClarke initially retired from the music industry in 1999, and was initially replaced in the group by Carl Wayne, former vocalist with The Move, who then died in 2004. The Hollies continue touring today with Peter Howarth as their vocalist.\\n\\nAllan and The Hollies were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 15, 2010.\\n\\nAllan returned to music in the 2010s, releasing albums in 2019 and 2023. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Allan+Clarke\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Allan Sherman was a pioneer of the comedy-rock scene.  Although not much to look at, the overweight, balding, short, Jewish man gained popularity and became quite the star because of his witty infusion of satirical comedy into very well orchestrated renditions of classic tunes and songs.  A song would usually have a lyric, perhaps a name or phrase, that has very little to do with what the original song was about, but the words would sound similar.  His albums had nothing to hide, either, as each one was recorded live, and all the laughter, and occasionally a lack thereof, could be heard.\\n\\nSherman was just a television producer, most famous for the quiz show \"I\\'ve Got a Secret,\" not at all known as a comedian or performer, and it shocked everyone in the know when songs from his album My Son, The Folk Singer became popular.  In fact, president John F. Kennedy was heard singing the song Sarah Jackman.  Sherman\\'s overnight popularity suddenly ended when the nation\\'s attention focused on Kennedy\\'s assassination, and the nation was too sad for such up-beat musical offerings.  \\n\\nSherman then slipped back into his longtime depression, and died, quietly, at the young age of 48. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Allan+Sherman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Mose Allison (born John Mose Allison. Jr., Tippo, MS, November 11, 1927; died 15 November 2016) was an American jazz pianist, singer. and songwriter. Amongst his best known songs is Parchman Farm. His music influenced many blues and rock artists including The Rolling Stones, John Mayall, J.J. Cale and The Who, that latter of whom played Allison\\'s song Young Man Blues on several tours. The father of country songwriter Amy Allison, he was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2006.\\n\\nAllison learned piano in grammar school, followed by trumpet in high school. He went to college at the University of Mississippi and Louisiana State University. He received a BA in English with a minor in Philosophy. After serving in the U.S. Army, he moved to New York City and launched his music career.\\n\\nAllison\\'s first exposure to blues on record was through Louis Jordan recordings, including \"Outskirts of Town\" and \"Pinetop Blues.\" Allison credits Jordan as being a major influence on him, and also credits Nat King Cole, Louis Armstrong and Fats Waller. He started out on trumpet but later switched to piano. In his youth, he had easy access, via the radio, to the music of Pete Johnson , Albert Ammons  and Meade Lux Lewis . Allison also credits the songwriter Percy Mayfield , \"The Poet Laureate of the Blues,\" as being a major inspiration on his songwriting. \\n\\nAfter a stint in college and the Army, Allison\\'s first professional gig was in Lake Charles, LA, in 1950. He returned to college to finish up at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, where he studied English and Philosophy, a far cry from his initial path as a chemical engineering major. \\n\\nAllison began his recording career with the Prestige label in 1956, shortly after he moved to New York City. He recorded an album with Al Cohn  and Bobby Brookmeyer , and then in 1957 got his own record contract. A big break was the opportunity to play with Cohn and Zoot Sims  shortly after his arrival in New York, but he later became more well known after playing with saxophonist Stan Getz. After leaving Prestige Records, where he recorded now classic albums like Back Country Suite (1957), Young Man Mose (1958), and Seventh Son (1958-59), he moved to Columbia for two years before meeting up with Nesuhi Ertegun of Atlantic Records. He recalled that he signed his contract with Atlantic after about ten minutes in Nesuhi\\'s office. Allison spent a big part of his recording career at Atlantic Records, where he became most friendly with Ertegun. After the company saw substantial growth and Allison was no longer working directly with him, he became discouraged and left. Allison has also recorded for Columbia (before he began his long relationship with Atlantic), and the Epic and Prestige labels. \\n\\nAllison\\'s discography is a lengthy one, and there are gems to be found on all of his albums, many of which can be found in vinyl shops. His output since 1957 has averaged at least one album a year until 1976, when he finished up at Atlantic with the classic Your Mind Is On Vacation. There was a gap of six years before he recorded again, this time for Elektra\\'s Musician subsidiary in 1982, when he recorded Middle Class White Boy. Since 1987, he\\'s been with Bluenote/Capitol. His debut for that label was Ever Since the World Ended. Allison has recorded some of the most creative material of his career with the Bluenote subsidiary of Capitol Records, including My Backyard (1992) and The Earth Wants You (1994), both produced by Ben Sidran. Also in 1994, Rhino Records released a boxed set, Allison Wonderland. \\n \\nAlthough his boogie woogie and bebop-laden piano style is innovative and fresh sounding when it comes to blues and jazz, it is as a songwriter that Allison really shines.\\n\\nHis music has influenced many blues and rock artists including The Rolling Stones, John Mayall, JJ Cale and The Who, who played his song Young Man Blues on several tours. Allison is the subject of the Pixies song Allison and Greg Brown song Mose Allison played here. His song Look Here was covered by The Clash on their album Sandinista; and Blue Cheer famously covered Parchman Farm but renamed or misspelled it as Parchment Farm. Van Morrison released an album of his songs entitled Tell Me Something: The Songs of Mose Allison.\\n\\nHe is the father of country songwriter Amy Allison.\\n\\nMose Allison was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2006.\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mose+Allison\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He began his recording career as an MC back in 1995 when he joined up with hip-hop producer Exile to form the mainstay indie rap group Emanon. Aloe released his debut solo album Shine Through on Stonethrow Records in 2006 and followed this up in 2010 with Good Things. He has also collaborated with the Cradle Orchestra under the name Bee, and they released the project Open Your Mind in 2009. His song \"I Need a Dollar\" is the intro song for the HBO show How to Make It in America. The I Need A Dollar Songfacts reports that after this retro soul track hit the charts throughout continental Europe, Blacc signed with major label Epic Records for the UK and Ireland release of the record. \\n\\nA few years later, Aloe would “stow away” on a Lootpack European tour and become fast friends with Oh No – a relationship which led to many fruitful collaborations as a solo artist.\\n\\nThese days, Aloe Blacc has evolved into a true Renaissance man – dubbed “the indie R. Kelly” by online retailer Turntable Lab. Recordings like his Latin cover of John Legend’s “Ordinary People” prove that – not only can this multi-instrumentalist produce, rap and sing – but he can flip it in Spanish, too. With an amazingly broad set of influences ranging widely from the acoustic guitar stylings of folk artist Cat Stevens, to the soul-stirring sounds of the Negro Spirituals, Aloe prides himself on the spectrum of his musical roots. His sound often forays into the digital R&B realm, but always grooves with a tinge of Latin and the pulse of hip-hop. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Aloe+Blacc\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Cash started his career as a tap dancer and performed with his brother in a group called the Step Brothers. He started singing later, hitting the Chicago scene with his group Alvin Cash and the Registers.  \\n\\nLegend has it that Andre Williams saw Alvin and his brothers group performing in the early 60\\'s (as The Crawlers) and had them record a tune, \"It\\'s Twine Time\", which was a rewrite of a Williams\\' 1957 hit called \"Bacon Fat\". The tune became a pop hit in 1965, and while \"The Crawlers\" proper, i.e. Alvin\\'s brothers, probably did not play on the track, backing band The Nightliters likely did. \\n\\nSoon after the success of the single, The Nightliters changed their name to The Crawlers and began touring with Cash.

       " 'Alvin \"Shine\" Robinson (December 22, 1937 – January 24, 1989), sometimes credited as Al Robinson, was an American rhythm and blues singer, guitarist, and songwriter, based in New Orleans. His recording of \"Something You Got\" reached the Billboard Hot 100 in 1964.\\n\\nHe was born in New Orleans, and by the late 1950s was established as a session musician in the city. In 1961 he recorded for Imperial Records in New Orleans, with \"I\\'m Leaving You Today\" betraying his influence by Ray Charles. His management was soon taken over by singer Joe Jones, who had had a hit with \"You Talk Too Much\" and who won Robinson a recording contract with Tiger Records, a new label set up in New York City by songwriters and record producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. In 1964, he recorded a version of Chris Kenner\\'s song \"Something You Got\". The song, featuring Robinson\\'s \"fantastically bluesy growl\", rose to no.52 on the Billboard pop chart.\\nHe moved with Leiber and Stoller to their next label, Red Bird Records, and recorded \"Down Home Girl\", a song written by Leiber with Artie Butler, arranged by Joe Jones, and produced by Leiber and Stoller. Although the record was critically acclaimed, and was regarded by Leiber and Stoller as the best record issued on the Red Bird label, it was not a commercial success, but was covered by the Rolling Stones on their 1965 album The Rolling Stones No. 2. Robinson\\'s later recordings for Red Bird and its subsidiary Blue Cat label, including a reshaped version of \"Let The Good Times Roll\" arranged by Wardell Quezergue, also failed to reach the charts.\\nRobinson continued to record in his own name and as a session guitarist. He moved to Los Angeles, and recorded \"Let Me Down Easy\", written by King Curtis, for Atco in 1967. He also began playing with Dr. John, and appeared as a guitarist on the albums Babylon, Dr. John\\'s Gumbo, and Hollywood Be Thy Name, as well as co-writing several album tracks with Dr. John. As a solo performer, Robinson recorded for Harold Battiste\\'s A.F.O. and Pulsar labels; one of his recordings for Pulsar, \"Sho\\' Bout To Drive Me Wild\", featured contributions from many New Orleans musicians including Battiste, Dr. John, Jessie Hill and King Floyd. He was also credited on Carly Simon\\'s album Playing Possum, and Ringo Starr\\'s Goodnight Vienna.\\nRobinson later returned to New Orleans, where he died in 1989 at the age of 51.\\n\\nAlvin aka Al Robinson ( 1937 - 1989 ) in the late 50\\'s was working as a session guitarist in New Orleans, serving for a time as guitar teacher to Shorty Long of \\'Here Comes The Judge\\' fame. Robinson\\'s first solo singles came out on Imperial in the early 60s and he also moved to New York for awhile. In 1964 Alvin Robinson became one of the first artists to record for the new tiger & Daisy labels operated by the writing and production team of Leiber and Stoller. His first 45 was a cover of Chris Kenner\\'s \\'Something You Got\\' and a cover of the Coasters hit \\'Searchin\\' made it to #8 R&B and #52 pop in June of 1964. In  September 1964, Robinson\\'s version of \\'Down Home Girl\\' b/w \\'Fever\\' came out as Red Bird 010, his only disc for that particular Leiber Stoller label). Another Leiber-Stoller hit that was previously recorded by The Coasters, Robinson\\'s take on \\'Down Home Girl was a proto-funk classic revamped later by the Rolling Stones, and Nazareth. The follow up 7\" was \\'How Can I Get Over You\\' b/w \\'I\\'m Gonna Put Some Hurt On You\\' in March of 1965.  After Leiber and Stoller lost control of their labels in 1966, Robinson cut minor regional records at sessions fo Joe Jones records, Atco and others. In 1969 he made his way to Los Angeles, recording for New Orleans expatriate and Sonny & Cher producer Harold Battiste\\'s A.F.O. label, and Pulsar. Robinson joined Dr. John\\'s touring lineup as guitarist in the 70\\'s and 80\\'s and played on albums like Dr. John\\'s \\'Gumbo\\', Carly Simon\\'s \\'Playing Possum\\',  Ringo Starr\\'s \\'Goodnight Vienna\\' Tom Waits\\' \"Blue Valentine\" in 1978 and Chuck E.

Currently she lives in Saint-Étienne-du-Grès, France near Avignon in the south.\\n\\nShe studied art in Paris and in the 60s moved to London. During this period she got to know the most prominent designers, musicians and artists belonging to the artistic circles she frequented. Her preferences were predominantly for the Surrealist movement and for bodily expression, since she has also studied the art of mime. The meeting with Dali changed her life.\\n\\nIn the following 15 years she became the only woman friend, the muse and confidant of the great artist and his wife Gala. She lived in their house in Cadaquès (Spain) and accompanied them when they moved to New York and Paris in the winter. Although he had declared that a woman should never paint, Dali became her mentor, allowing her to work alongside him and teaching her all she knows about art and its techniques.\\nHe took her to visit all the great museums of the world, acting as her guide in the discovery of artists from his own highly individual point of view. Famous throughout the world as a pop singer, she soared to celebrity when her first song entered the international hit parades, but this not lead her to neglect the passion of her life: painting.\\n\\nIn 1975, disillusioned by a shallow but surprisingly conservative fashion industry and encouraged by boyfriend David Bowie, who paid for singing and dancing lessons, Lear decided to launch a career in music. Bowie recommended her a Hungarian voice coach Florence Wiese-Norberg, with whom he also worked.[16] She would record a demo song called \"Stars\" with him, however, the track still remains unreleased\\n\\nIn 1980 she had her first show in Rotterdam. Encouraged by the success of this and the publicity generated by the media, she went on to display in Paris, Berlin, Milan and Geneva, attracting the attention of the European collectors. She likes to recall the fact that she waited 20 years before having the chance to show her paintings and she is grateful to Dali for having been her friend and teacher. Pop icon Amanda Lear has recorded 15 studio albums and has released some 60 singles to date and has so far sold approximately 15 million albums and 25-30 million singles worldwide.\\n\\n2012 saw the release of a new album \"I Don\\'t Like Disco\", from which a few single were taken including La bete et la belle and I Don\\'t Like Disco. \\n\\nHer latest news can be read on her official site: www.amanda-lear.com.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Amanda+Lear\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

While performing on the Queen Street West bar scene she eventually met guitarist Jeff Healey, who was struck by her powerful voice and took her on tour.

Unfortunately, it was not immediately released in the USA, and it did not receive the same radio attention when it eventually hit the shelves; although it did crack Billboard\\'s Heatseekers Chart for several months.

The band are currently unsigned but have lots of label interest after receiving much support from BBC Introducing. Amber played on the BBC Introducing stage at Reading and Leeds Festival and their track \\'Noah\\' has featured on the Radio One playlist. A second EP is scheduled for release towards the end of 2013.\\n\\n4. A Danish post-rock band.  ”One Minute Love Affair” is the second Album from the Danish trio, who has once again teamed up with an International top Producer. While their debut album was recorded with Indie guru Steve Albini (Nirvana, Pixies, Mogwai), it is this time John Parish (PJ. Harvey, Goldfrapp og Eels) who tailored his producer magic to the unique sounds of Amber. ”One Minute Love Affair” builds on the foundation laid on the highly critically acclaimed debut from 2004, but at the same time explores new sides of Amber’s minimalist soundscape. \\n\\nWith Parish behind the mixer, Amber’s songs gain a new edge, while still maintaining the intimacy that has become the bands trademark, within a full, vibrating and yet simple universe. Remaining true to the original outset, Amber playfully incorporates elements of alternative disco and funk into their already unusual take on Alternative Rock. The result is shorter yet more quirky songs still featuring Amber’s characteristic instrumentation (Bass, Vibraphone, Drums and Vocals).\\n\\n“One Minute Love Affair” also features a guest appearance by Scottish singer Aidan Moffat from Arab Strap. The result is a killer duet on the title track between him and Amber vocalist, Biljana Stojkoska. \\n\\n5. Amber were MacLeod & Julian McAllister, both friends and contemporaries of Donovan on the early 60s St. Albans folk scene. A 10\" collects the only extant studio tapes of the band, recorded in the early 70s during a period that saw the band playing regularly around London. The strapline on the sleeve reads \"acoustic music that derives from folk and blues with a touch of psychedelia\" which is true as far as it goes but gives too much significance to the blues, not enough to the occasional immensity of McAllister\\'s vocal and none at all to the importance of the sitar in the mix. The lilting glory of \"Sea Shell Rock Me\" (appearing in two versions) is the highlight. The song is basically a folk love song which coils in around itself in time to a beautiful winding sitar line and reminds of all the possibilities music seemed to offer 30 years ago.\\n\\n6.

There already was an Amy Stewart registered with Actor\\'s Equity, so she changed the spelling of her name to Amii when she signed there. This eventually led to her break into the music industry, recording Disco music. Before being signed onto Ariola Records, Stewart appeared in the stage production Bubbling Brown Sugar on Broadway in 1975.\\n\\nHer first single, a disco cover version of the Eddie Floyd hit \"Knock On Wood\", reached number one in the U.S. in April 1979, and earned her a platinum record and a Grammy Award nomination. It was her only Top 10 American hit single, and she was dismissed there as a one hit wonder. She fared better on the R&B charts and Dance charts where Stewart continued to chart singles into the 1980s.\\n\\nHowever, in Europe she established herself as a popular performer during the disco era of the late 1970s, scoring her highest chart placing in the UK singles chart with another disco cover version, of The Doors\\' \"Light My Fire\" (released as \"Light My Fire/137 Disco Heaven\"), which reached number five in 1979. Further singles such as \"Jealousy\", which was a mix of the fading out disco and the New Wave and Hi-NRG hititng the dancefloors, continued her chart run in continental Europe and proved very popular in European discos, but as disco began to lose popularity she branched into other contemporary musical styles such as R&B and Pop. During this period she worked with such producers as Giorgio Moroder and Ennio Morricone. Her 1984 single, \"Friends\" reached number one in several European countries, and peaked at number 12 in the UK in early 1985. The follow-up single \"That Loving Feeling\" received good reviews but failed to make the UK Top 40. Both singles were lifted from her highly acclaimed album \"Try Love\", which highlighted a new downtempo and soulful sound. A year later, a remixed version of \"Knock On Wood\" would take her back into the UK Top 10, also topping the UK dance charts.\\n\\nStewart has resided in Italy since the mid 1980s, and in her adopted homeland has become a respected performer of a wide range of musical styles. In 1993 and 1994 she was one of several singers invited to perform at the Vatican before the Pope in Christmas pageants.

Ja Rule has beefed with rappers DMX, 50 Cent, The Game, Busta Rhymes, Dr. Dre, and Eminem.\\n\\nEarly life:\\n\\nHe attended Junior High School in Floral Park, New York, where he met his future wife Aisha Murray and they graduated in 1991. They attended Martin Van Buren High School together but he did not graduate. When Atkins was five years old, his sister died from respiratory problems. Growing up in a strict religious home, Atkin\\'s family did not celebrate birthdays and Christmas, and as a child, was not allowed to listen to rap music. When he first heard it, he decided to be a rapper. He would sneak the music into his house and played it on his CD player when his mother wasn\\'t around. Atkins is married to his high school sweetheart, Aisha Atkins née Murray.They have three children: Brittney (11), Jeffrey Junior (6) and Jordan (3).He and his family live in a mansion in New Jersey.\\n\\nRise to Fame:\\n\\nAt age 15, Atkins appeared with 0-1 and Chris Black as part of Cash Money Click. This would lead to him being signed by TVT Records in 1994. He would end up being heard by a young DJ who called himself DJ Irv, then later Irv Gotti. Gotti, was a friend of Jay-Z\\'s and he was also a DJ for Def Jam Recordings. During the mid 90s his main priority was meeting Ja Rule. He wanted to sign Ja to his new label Murder Inc. Records. He wanted Ja because of his distinct deep voice. After Irv was able to sign Ja along with DMX and Jay-Z to Def Jam. He began to have an idea that they all work together. They formed a group named The Murderers. They recorded many songs together. Friction tore the group apart, DMX, a rapper that sounds very similar to Ja accused him of trying to steal his style with the deep voice, by saying that before the three were signed Ja tried to make his voice sound lighter but heard him embrace the deep voice and tried to imitate it. They had planned to release an album together, but this idea was scrapped and they all made appearances on their respective albums. Still, around this time, Ja Rule was still fairly unknown. Jay-Z, at the time a young star and new to Def Jam, was the most popular rapper in hip hop. Russell Simmons had the idea that in order to build hype around Ja Rule and capitalize on Jay\\'s popularity that Ja Rule do a verse on Jay-Z\\'s 1998 single Can I Get A..., which also featured Amil.

He achieved commercial success and fame both as frontman to the country-rock band Pure Prairie League in the 1970s, and as a solo artist beginning in 1983, where his talents as a vocalist and musician have placed him in high demand as a guest vocalist, and a duet partner (with artists including Dolly Parton, Reba McEntire, Amy Grant and Barbra Streisand).\\n\\nGill was born in Norman, Oklahoma, the home of the University of Oklahoma Sooners and learned to play several instruments, including banjo and guitar before he started high school at Oklahoma City\\'s Northwest Classen High School. After he graduated, he played in a number of bluegrass bands. He debuted on the national scene with the country-rock band Pure Prairie League in 1979, appearing on that band\\'s album Can\\'t Hold Back. Gill is the lead singer on their hit song, \"Let Me Love You Tonight\" (1980), which he was still performing in concert years later - thus, he said, confusing many fans who knew him only from his subsequent solo work. Gill appeared on two subsequent albums along with his then-wife Janis Oliver.\\n\\nDeparting Pure Prairie League in 1981, Gill joined Rodney Crowell’s backing band The Notorious Cherry Bombs, where he met and worked with Tony Brown and Emory Gordy Jr., both of whom would later produce many of his future solo albums. \\n\\nSigning as a solo artist with RCA Records in 1983, he first charted while on that label.

His other albums include Next Big Thing (2003) and Let\\'s Make Sure We Kiss Goodbye (2000). The Guitar Slinger Songfacts says that Gill released his twelfth studio album, Guitar Slinger, on October 25, 2011 via MCA Nashville. It was his manager, Larry Fitzgerald, who came up with the title, as he felt there was something different the way Gill was playing the guitar on the record.  \\n\\nGill hosted the CMA Awards every year from 1992 to 2003. In 2004 he received a Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance. In 1997, he was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.\\n\\nHe married country singer Janis Oliver (of Sweethearts of the Rodeo fame) in 1980. The couple have one daughter, Jennifer Jerene Gill, born 5 May 1982. Vince and Janis separated in the mid-1990s and eventually divorced in June 1998.

       " 'Ana Torroja is a Spanish vocalist, and was the lead singer of the million-selling trio Mecano. Daughter of a noted engineer, she was born in Madrid on December 28, 1959, and met José María Cano while studying economics at university. The two became good friends, and José María soon introduced Ana to his younger brother Nacho. Upon hearing Ana singing along to his brother\\'s compositions on the guitar, Nacho suggested that the three should form a band, and in 1981 Mecano was born.\\n\\nAfter seven Mecano albums and fame in Europe and Latin America, months of continuous touring were taking their toll on the band, especially on Ana who was starting to develop vocal problems. In 1993 the band announced a \"temporary split\". While José and Nacho composed solo albums, Ana chose to travel round the world to visit places like Hawaii, Bombay and New York, cities she had sung about while fronting Mecano. It was in New York that she set up home and took dance classes.\\n\\nBy 1997 Ana felt confident enough to sing again and moved to London to record her first solo album Puntos cardinales. The album marked a curious change for Ana, as her new songs were not written from a male point of view by the Cano brothers, she felt she could express herself in Spanish as a woman for the first time. The first single from the album A contratiempo was a Spanish cover of an old Bette Midler song, \"Bottomless\". The video showed a \"new\" Ana Torroja with plumper lips and other attributes hitherto unseen on the former Mecano star.\\n\\nIn 1998—partially due to the expense and commercial failure of José María\\'s opera project—Mecano reformed for the double-disc greatest hits compilation Ana, José, Nacho, which also featured seven new songs.\\n\\nIn 2006, Ana released \"Me Cuesta Tanto Olvidarte\", an album which featured 13 of Mecano\\'s greatest hits reborn. \"Hijo de La Luna\" was remade as a Huapango Jarocho, featuring a whole Mariachi ensemble. \"Maquillaje\" was given a burlesque, cabaret sound, while \"Barco a Venus\" was made a Rumba. Other hits included were \"Los Amantes\" (w/ a Samba makeover), \"Mujer Contra Mujer\" (in a solo orchestral rendition), \"Busco Algo Barato\", \"Cruz De navajas,\" and \"La Fuerza Del Destino.\" Amazingly, the title track is nowhere to be seen. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ana+Torroja\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Guetta had been DJing around France playing popular tunes, but his brain was particularly rewired in 1987 when he heard a Farley Jackmaster Funk track on French radio. He taped the track, brought a copy to a gig, and promptly cleared the floor with it during one of his own sets. Things loosened up a year later when acid house came to France and Guetta successfully promoted his own club nights. It was during one of those nights in 1992 that he met Robert Owens, a Chicago-based house legend who was touring across European at the time. Guetta played Owens some of his own tracks, and Owens picked one he liked enough to sing over. The result was \"Up and Away,\" a minor hit that lurked in garage DJ crates for the next four years. Guetta\\'s carefree attitude -- that he only produces good music while he\\'s having casual fun -- kept the DJ from releasing anything until 2001\\'s \"Just a Little More Love.\" The track featured American gospel singer Chris Willis, who met Guetta while on vacation in France. Another slow burner, \"Just a Little More Love,\" kept popping up in sets for the next two years, first in an electro version and later in a pumped-up Wally Lopez remix. During this time, Guetta snuck out a bootleg remix of David Bowie\\'s \"Heroes,\" retitled \"Just for One Day.\" Bowie gave the go-ahead to release the track officially, and Guetta soon had a massive hit on his hands. Guetta featured the liberated boot on his first mix CD, Fuck Me I\\'m Famous, named after Guetta\\'s successful Ibiza-based party. The fun-loving slacker DJ finally got around to releasing a collection of his own productions in 2004, Just a Little More Love on Astralwerks. Guetta Blaster arrived that same year, followed by Poplife in 2007. Chris Willis sung lead vocals on the latter album, which spun off multiple dance singles in multiple countries. Fuck Me I\\'m Famous: International, Vol. 2 was then released in July 2008, giving listeners a taste of the stylish sounds that orchestrated Guetta\\'s summer club events in Ibiza.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Anaklein\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Anastacia (born Anastacia Lyn Newkirk; September 17, 1968) in Chicago, Illinois, to a showbiz family and is an American singer songwriter. Anastacia has been highly successful in Europe, Asia, South Africa and South America, but has not had as much success in her native United States. Her debut album, Not That Kind, released in 2000, achieved multi-platinum sales in Australia, New Zealand and much of Europe.\\n\\nIn 2005, she was recognized for worldwide sales of over 20 million albums/records. Anastacia is world-renowned for her powerful soul voice, and her small stature has also led to her being nicknamed \"The Little Lady with The Big Voice\" and has been compared to Tina Turner and Aretha Franklin.  She was also known for her trademark glasses (often darkly tinted), but she had surgery to correct her vision permanently in August 2005.  She also made headlines when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2003.\\n\\nHer debut album Not That Kind was released in 2000. The album was a huge success, reaching the top ten in eight countries in Europe, Asia, and Oceania. It went quadruple platinum in Australia spurred by the success of her debut smash \"I\\'m Outta Love\" which was the most popular single of the year in that country for 2000. \"I\\'m Outta Love\" topped the charts in Australia, peaked at #2 in France and also reached number 6 in both the UK and Germany. In The US, it was only a minor radio hit. The second single \"Not That Kind\" reached number 11 in the UK and was a big hit all over Europe and the rest of the world. \"Cowboys & Kisses\" was released as the third single off the album, charting in the top 40 in some European countries. As the last single, \"Made for Lovin\\' You\" charted in the UK (27) and France (72).\\n\\nWhile \"I\\'m Outta Love\" was a Top 10 song on the Hot Dance Club Play, \"Not That Kind\" did not chart high on the Billboard Hot 100.\\n\\nHer second album, Freak of Nature achieved respectable sales although it did not match the level of international success of Not That Kind. The album title derives from a nickname her mother called her.[citation needed] The first single released was \"Paid My Dues\". The second single, \"One Day in Your Life\", reached number 11 in the UK and the top 10 in many European countries. The next single \"Why\\'d You Lie to Me\" reached the top 30 in the UK. \"You\\'ll Never Be Alone\", the 4th single, reached #28 on the Adult Contemporary chart in the U.S. When the album was finally released in the United States in May 2002, she dedicated the album to Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes,[citation needed] who had died in a car wreck the month before. Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes was partly responsible for Anastacia\\'s success, since Lisa hosted MTV\\'s The Cut where Anastacia got her first break. Soon after she released a double disc edition featuring two bonus hits, remixes for three of the tracks on the album and two live tracks taken from a Japan gig that was performed on the September 13, 2002.\\n\\nAnastacia joined Celine Dion, Mary J. Blige, Cyndi Lauper, Shakira, Cher, Dixie Chicks and Stevie Nicks for VH1\\'s Divas Live in 2002 and she also contributed the song \"Love Is a Crime\" to the Chicago soundtrack. The song peaked at #1 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart and enjoyed moderate airplay on Rhythmic/Dance format. Anastacia was selected to sing the theme from 2002 FIFA World Cup: \"Boom\".\\n\\nAs she said on Rove (Australia) in 2004, she wanted to have more edge to her vocals as she felt there was something missing from her previous works. She brought in many rock instruments which brought a new atmosphere to her music. She also felt that she still needed the funkiness and the pop as the singer felt that too much edge would sound wrong with her voice. Out of this a new sound was formed. She describes her sound as \"sprock\" - a combination of soul, pop and rock. She named the album after herself.\\n\\nAnastacia entered record studios in September 2003 to begin recording her next album, working with Glen Ballard, Dallas Austin, and Dave Stewart for release in 2004. On the album, Anastacia also collaborated with P.O.D. lead singer Sonny Sandoval on the socially-conscious track \"I Do\".\\n\\nThe first single, released in March, was \"Left Outside Alone\", which saw a change in direction for Anastacia. Anastacia proved to be a smash hit reaching the top of the album charts in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Australia, Greece, Germany, and Italy and number 2 in Portugal and Spain. \"Left Outside Alone\" proved to be equally successful reaching number 1 in Australia, Spain, Italy, Austria and Switzerland; number 2 in the Netherlands + Germany, number 3 in the UK and reaching the top 5 on the composite European chart. Strong airplay throughout Europe gave the song a Top 40 Charts world airplay ranking as one of the top five songs played on top 40 radio stations throughout the world in April 2004.\\n\\nUnlike her first two albums, which were released in her homeland of America, Anastacia was not, despite being scheduled for release on three occasions. \"Left Outside Alone\" was released twice, but failed to pick up heavy airplay. It only gained sporadic Adult Contemporary and Hot AC format airplay. Again, it sparked Rhythmic/Dance format airplay and the dance mix of \"Left Outside Alone\" peaked at #1 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play. After the original version of \"Left Outside Alone\" failed to catch on because of lukewarm promotional pushes, especially on radio, the album was postponed and eventually cancelled after the release date of August 30, 2004 passed. It was the 10th best selling single of 2004, with points of over 4,500,000 millions copies sold.\\n\\nAnastacia released three further internationally successful singles; \"Sick and Tired\" (which gave her another #1 in Spain and another UK Top 5 single), the 16th best selling single of 2004 with 3,805,000 points , \"Welcome to My Truth\" (her best-selling hit in Spain), and the ballad \"Heavy on My Heart\" proceeds from the sale of which went towards her \\'Anastacia Fund\\' (a charitable organization providing research funding for breast cancer).\\n\\nA small batch of Anastacia the album was released with a bonus DVD, Anastacia poster and slip case. The DVD includes \"Making Of Anastacia\", \"2002 Europe Promo Tour\" and a photo gallery.\\n\\nIn late 2005, she released her first greatest hits collection, called Pieces of a Dream, named after a track of the same name. The album spawned the hit singles \"Pieces of a Dream\" and the duet with Eros Ramazzotti \"I Belong to You\", which was a huge hit in Europe, charting and peaking in the top ten in almost all the European countries. Even though Sony BMG did force her to release this collection, Anastacia says she is happy now that it was created as it was like a \"story book\", or summary of the first five years of her career.\\n\\nNot long after the release of \"I Belong to You\", Anastacia released her first live DVD Live at Last on March 27, 2006 in Europe. The DVD contains footage from concerts in Berlin and Munich. It includes music videos to her four singles (\"Left Outside Alone\" [US version], \"Everything Burns\" [with Ben Moody], \"Pieces Of A Dream\" and \"I Belong to You\", with Eros Ramazzotti), five alternative videos (I Do, Rearview, Seasons Change, Underground Army and Time) to songs from her self named album, and a documentary about the tour.\\n\\nOn July 24, Anastacia announced that her long awaited fourth studio album Heavy Rotation will be released October 27, 2008 in Europe and Asia (and elsewhere in 2009). The new album will feature collaborations with producers Ne-Yo, The Heavyweights, Lester Mendez, JR Rotem and Rodney Jerkins. The album\\'s first single, called \"I Can Feel You\", began playing in some radio markets on August 25, 2008. The second single from Heavy Rotation was \"Absolutely Positively\", later served as a promotional single only. The third official single from the album, \"Defeated\", was released as a promotional single in Europe without a music video.\\n\\nHer fourth studio album proved to be less successful than her previous ones; her singles failed to reach the top 40 in her most commercially successful country (UK). Anastacia however remained positive, stating that other artists have faced the same problems while changing a record label, also blaming the world economical crisis and the label\\'s decision to alter her sound from her own chosen sprock sound of her previous record to a more \"urban feel\". In later years Anastacia would publicly admit regret towards the change of sound, citing personal problems that led to a creative sell-out. Regardless of the lack of commercial success, the album was ranked No. 10 on Billboard magazine\\'s online \"Readers\\' Poll: 10 Best Albums of 2008\".\\nIn 2009, the Women\\'s World Award presented Anastacia with the World Artist Award, recognizing the singer\\'s success and ongoing positive influence in pop music.\\n\\nIn June 2009, Anastacia began her second tour throughout Europe to promote her fourth studio album. The tour was funded by the singer herself, not her label, and was well received by critics and fans alike. In November and December 2009 Anastacia, Chaka Khan and Lulu were headlining the Here Come the Girls a special Christmas concert that visited the United Kingdom only. On December 7, 2009 Anastacia opened the annual Royal Variety Performance with Lulu and Chaka Khan, performing a rendition of \"Relight My Fire\". The tour was an overall success, selling out 24 shows. In October 2009, Anastacia released a collaborative single with British band Ben\\'s Brother entitled \"Stalemate\", which was included on the band\\'s album Battling Giants.\\n\\nDuring the summer of 2012, Anastacia toured throughout Europe.\\n\\nIn July 2012, Anastacia announced on her Twitter page (and Facebook fan page)the release of a new commercial single for car company Škoda Auto. She performed the song \"What Can We Do (Deeper Love)\" for the first time on July 10 in the Jazz Festival in Montreaux, Switzerland. She later released the video for the song through her social media pages.\\n\\nOn September 17, it was announced that the singer had signed with the \"BMG Masters Model\" service of BMG Rights Management, along with the service\\'s primary German-based distributing partner, Rough Trade Distribution. Global distribution is expected to be achieved via a range of partnering labels and distribution services. The deal included the release of her following two albums, It\\'s a Man\\'s World, a collection of covers of songs by male rock artists released on November 9, 2012, followed by an album of original material.\\n\\nThroughout November and December 2012 Anastacia took part in the annual Night of the Proms, a series of concerts held in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany which combine classical music with famous pop songs. On February 2, 2013, Anastacia tweeted that she would start writing for her next studio album of new material in the following week.\\n\\nOn February 27, 2013, Anastacia announced that she was forced to cancel her European tour due to the fact that she was diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time and was undergoing treatment. On July 20, 2013, Anastacia was given the all-clear from breast cancer for a second time, tweeting \"Cancer Free Forever\". On October 1, 2013 Anastacia informed the media that she had undergone a double mastectomy. Due to her decade-long charitable efforts in breast cancer awareness, Anastacia became only the second woman to be presented with the Humanitarian Award at the GQ Men of the Year Awards in 2013. Anastacia later confirmed via her Twitter account that she was writing and recording songs for her sixth studio album, including working with producers John Fields and Steve Diamond. She also stated it would mark a return to her \"sprock\" sound.\\n\\nThe album, entitled Resurrection, was released in May 2014 and was met with both critical and commercial success, giving the singer her sixth top ten Italian album and fifth top ten UK album. It also reached the top 5 of the Swiss and German charts and the top ten of the Dutch charts. Reviews were overwhelmingly positive, acknowledging a return to form from the singer as well as a creative resurgence. The lead single \"Stupid Little Things\" was released on April 4. Although only moderately successful, reaching the top ten in Belgium and top 20 in Italy it was quickly met with a positive reaction from music critics, with MTV\\'s Brad Stern naming it one of the \"5 Must-Hear Pop Songs of the Week!\" and calling it a \"return to form\" for the \"pop princess and proof that Anastacia\\'s a true survivor\", after her second battle with breast cancer. On April 12 Anastacia was given the Germen Radio Regenbogen Award for Charity and Entertainment. On June 23 Anastacia announced that due to a hernia procedure she would be unable to promote the album for a number of weeks.

       " 'André George Previn (Andreas Ludwig Priwin; April 6, 1929 – February 28, 2019) was a German-American pianist, conductor, and composer. Previn won four Academy Awards for his film work and ten Grammy Awards for his recordings and one more for his Lifetime Achievement.\\n\\nPrevin was born in Berlin, Germany, the son of Charlotte (née Epstein) and Jack Previn (Jakob Priwin), who was a lawyer, judge, and music teacher. He is said to have been \"a distant relative of\" the composer Gustav Mahler. However, in a pre-concert public interview at Lincoln Center, in May 2012, Previn laughed at the suggestion that he was related to Mahler. The year of his birth is uncertain. Whereas most published reports give 1929, Previn himself stated that 1930 was his birth year.\\n\\nIn 1938, his Jewish family left Berlin to live in Paris, but moved to Los Angeles after a year or so. His great-uncle, Charles Previn, was music director for Universal. André grew up in Los Angeles and became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1943. At Previn\\'s 1946 graduation from Beverly Hills High School he played a musical duet with Richard M. Sherman; Previn played the piano, accompanying Sherman (who played flute). Coincidentally, both composers won 1964 Oscars for different films, both winning in musical categories.\\n\\nIn 1951 and 1952, while stationed at the Presidio of San Francisco during his military service, Previn took private conducting lessons from Pierre Monteux, which he valued highly.\\n\\nPrevin came to prominence by arranging and composing Hollywood film scores first working for MGM when he was still in high school in 1946 having been noticed by the studio\\'s music department for his work with a local radio program.[8] The film studios, he said in 2005, \"were always looking for somebody who was talented, fast and cheap and, because I was a kid, I was all three. So they hired me to do piecework and I evidently did it very well.\" At 18 he became a composer-conductor for the studio. His first official credit was for an entry in the Lassie series, The Sun Comes Up (1949), which much later he thought was \"the most inept score you ever heard\" after seeing a television rerun.\\n\\nPrevin remained with MGM for a decade and a half, but resigned in his early 30s. He told Emma Brockes of The Guardian in 2008: \"At MGM you knew you were going to be working next year, you knew you were going to get paid. But I was too ambitious musically to settle for it. And I wanted to gamble with whatever talent I might have had.\"\\n\\nHis break with the film world in the 1960s was not as straightforward as he often tried to claim in later life. His film work continued until Rollerball (1975). Over his entire film career, Previn was involved in the music for over 50 movies as composer, conductor or performer.\\n\\nIn 1967, Previn succeeded Sir John Barbirolli as music director of the Houston Symphony Orchestra. In 1968, he began his tenure as principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO), serving in that post until 1979. During his LSO tenure, he and the LSO appeared on the BBC Television programme André Previn\\'s Music Night. However, during his period with the LSO, according to the music critic Martin Bernheimer, Previn gained the reputation of being \"a first-rate conductor of second-rate music.\"\\n\\nFrom 1976 to 1984, he was music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) and, in turn, had another television series with the PSO entitled Previn and the Pittsburgh. He was also principal conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra from 1985 to 1988.\\n\\nIn 1985, he became music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Although Previn\\'s tenure with the orchestra was deemed satisfactory from a professional perspective, other conductors, including Kurt Sanderling, Simon Rattle, and Esa-Pekka Salonen, did a better job at selling out concerts. Previn clashed frequently with Ernest Fleischmann (the LAPO\\'s Executive VP and General Manager), including the dispute when Fleischmann failed to consult Previn before naming Salonen as Principal Guest Conductor of the orchestra, complete with a tour of Japan. As a result of Previn\\'s objections, Salonen\\'s title and Japanese tour were withdrawn; however, shortly thereafter, in April 1989, Previn resigned. Four months later, Salonen was named Music Director Designate of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, officially taking the post of Music Director in October 1992.\\n\\nPrevin also enjoyed a long relationship with the medium of television, featuring in Meet André Previn (1969) on London Weekend Television, the Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show in 1971 and 1972 (BBC), André Previn\\'s Music Night (conducting the London Symphony Orchestra—three programmes in 1973, others in 1975 and 1976), television interviews with other artists, appearances on Call My Bluff, and participation in documentaries about popular music and jazz during the 1970s and 1980s. Previn became known to a broad public through his television work. In the United Kingdom he worked on TV with the London Symphony Orchestra. In the U.S. the television program \"Previn and the Pittsburgh\" (1977) featured him in collaboration with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.\\n\\nPrevin is particularly remembered in Britain for his performance as \"Mr. Andrew Preview\" (or \"Privet\") on the Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show in 1971, which involved his conducting a performance of Edvard Grieg\\'s Piano Concerto with Eric Morecambe as the comically inept soloist (being swindled into it by being told that Yehudi Menuhin would be his solo violinist). \"Preview\" then remarks that \"I\\'ll go fetch my baton. It\\'s in Chicago.\" This comic ad-lib made Morecambe immediately realise the sketch would be a success.[16] Later in the sketch \"Mr Preview\" accuses Morecambe of playing all the wrong notes; Morecambe retorts that he has been playing \"all the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order\". Because of other commitments the only time available for Previn to learn his part in the show was during a transatlantic flight but the talent he showed for comedy won high praise from his co-performers. He made a second appearance in their eighth series. In the sketch, he is tricked into visiting the pair again, and they suggest that if he works with them again, he could receive a knighthood. He conducted a 1920s-style dance band as the pair sang, then joined them at the end of the episode in singing Bring Me Sunshine. Previn also appeared in the 1972 Christmas Show, bemoaning the apparent consequences of his 1971 appearance: the only conducting work he now gets is on a London bus.\\n\\nAt a concert he conducted with the Grieg Concerto included in the program in Britain, Previn had to pause the playing to allow the audience time to stop giggling as they remembered the sketch. Previn himself recalled in 2005 that people in Britain still recall the sketch years later: \"Taxi drivers still call me Mr Preview\".\\n\\nPrevin was married five times. His first marriage, in 1952, was to jazz singer Betty Bennett, with whom he had two daughters, Claudia Previn[18] Stasny and Alicia Previn (a violinist for the Irish band In Tua Nua and a founding member of the Young Dubliners). Previn divorced Bennett in 1957, a few months before she gave birth to Alicia.\\n\\nIn 1959, he married Dory Langan. A singer-songwriter, Dory became widely known as a lyricist with whom Previn collaborated on several Academy Award-nominated film scores during their marriage. After Previn divorced her in 1969 during her hospitalization for a mental breakdown, and after Previn was caught having an affair with 23 year old Mia Farrow , Dory resumed her career as a singer-songwriter with On My Way to Where (1970), a critically acclaimed album whose confessional lyrics were described as \"searingly honest\", and chronicled both her mental health struggles and the infidelity that she alleged had at once precipitated the end of her marriage to Previn and exacerbated her intermittent mental illness. In 2013, jazz singer Kate Dimbleby and pianist Naadia Sheriff revisited Dory Previn\\'s musical reflections on her marriage to André Previn in the London cabaret show, Beware Of Young Girls: The Dory Previn Story.\\n\\nPrevin\\'s third marriage, in 1970, was to Mia Farrow. Before their divorce in 1979, Previn and Farrow had three biological children together—twins Matthew and Sascha, born in 1970, and Fletcher, born in 1974. They then adopted Vietnamese infants Lark Song and Summer \"Daisy\" Song (born October 6, 1974), followed by Soon-Yi Previn, a Korean child whose age a physician\\'s bone scan placed between six and eight years old and whose unknown birth date her adoptive parents estimated as October 8, 1970. Lark died on Christmas Day 2008. In the aftermath of the scandal involving Soon-Yi and Mia Farrow\\'s partner Woody Allen, Previn said of Soon-Yi, \"She does not exist.\"\\n\\nPrevin\\'s longest marriage was his fourth. In January 1982 he married Heather Sneddon. With Heather he had two children, Li-An Mary, adopted 1982 and Lukas Alexander, born 1983.[citation needed] Previn wrote a brief memoir of his early years in Hollywood, No Minor Chords, which was published in 1991, edited by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and dedicated to Heather. This marriage ended in divorce after 17 years.\\n\\nHis fifth marriage, in 2002, was to the German violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, for whom in the previous year he had composed a violin concerto. They announced their divorce in August 2006, but continued to work together in concerts afterwards.\\n\\nPrevin died on February 28, 2019 at home in Manhattan at the age of 89.\\n\\n\\nRecordings\\nPrevin\\'s discography contains hundreds of recordings in film, jazz, classical music and contemporary classical music. Because of the huge number of recordings, the following lists are necessarily highly selective. A full discography (including LP/CD record codes) is available in Frédéric Döhl: André Previn. Musikalische Vielseitigkeit und ästhetische Erfahrung, Stuttgart 2012, pp. 295–319.\\n\\nFilm music\\nMost of the films which incorporate Previn\\'s music are still available as Videos/DVDs or/and as soundtrack records. Some of his soundtracks have been reissued in recent years, including those from Elmer Gantry, Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse , Inside Daisy Clover, and Dead Ringer.\\n\\nJazz recordings\\nPrevin made dozens of jazz recordings as both a leader and sideman, primarily during two periods of his career: from 1945 to 1967, and then again from 1989 to 2001, with just a handful of recordings in between and afterward (while he focused his career on conducting/recording classical music, and later on composing contemporary art music). Previn also did several crossover recordings with classical singers like Eileen Farrell, Leontyne Price or Kiri Te Kanawa, too, as well as several Easy-Listening records with piano and orchestra in the 1960s (beginning with Like Young. Secret Songs for Young Lovers, 1959. with David Rose and His Orchestra).\\n\\nLike Oscar Peterson, whom Previn admired a great deal, and Bill Evans, Previn worked a lot as a trio pianist (usually with bass and drums). Following his performance on Shelly Manne\\'s recording Modern Jazz Performances of Songs from My Fair Lady in 1956, Previn released several albums of jazz interpretations of songs from broadway musicals as well as several solo piano recordings focussed on the songbooks of popular composers (André Previn Plays Songs by Vernon Duke, 1958; André Previn Plays Songs by Harold Arlen, 1960; Ballads. Solo Jazz Standards, 1996; Alone: Ballads for Solo Piano, 2007), the late recording of songs by Harold Arlen with singer Sylvia McNair and bass player David Finck (Come Rain or Shine. The Harold Arlen Songbook, 1996), and his TV shows with Oscar Peterson (1974) – which Marlon Brando simply called \"one of the greatest hours I ever saw on television\" – and Ella Fitzgerald (1979) respectively.\\n\\nJazz critic and historian Ted Gioia wrote in his book about West Coast jazz, the scene to which Previn belonged:\\n\\nHis projects varied greatly in terms of quality and jazz content, but at his best Previn could be a persuasive, moving jazz musician. Despite his deep roots in symphonic music, Previn largely steered clear of Third Stream classicism in his jazz work, aiming more at an earthy, hard-swinging piano style at times reminiscent of Horace Silver. Long before his eventual retreat from his jazz work, Previn had become something of a popularizer of jazz rather than a serious practitioner of the music. At his best, however, his music reflected a strong indigenous feel for the jazz idiom.\\n\\nDizzy Gillespie stated,\\n\\nHe has the flow, you know, which a lot of guys don\\'t have and won\\'t ever get. Yeah. I heard him play and I knew. A lot of guys, they have the technique, the harmonic sense. They\\'ve got the perfect coordination. And, yeah, all that\\'s necessary. But you need something more, you know? Even if you only make an oooooooo, like that, you got to have the flow.\\n\\nJazz recordings as leader/co-leader\\n\\nAndré Previn Plays Harry Warren (RCA Victor, 1952)\\nCollaboration (RCA Victor, 1955) – with Shorty Rogers\\nLet\\'s Get Away from It All (Decca, 1955)\\nDouble Play!

       " 'Andre Williams (Zephire Andre Williams, Bessemer, Alabama, November 1, 1936 - March 17, 2019) was an American rhythm & blues singer and songwriter who started his career in the 1950s at Fortune Records in Detroit.  Andre \"Mr. Rhythm\" Williams most famous songs include the hits \"Jail Bait,\" \"Greasy Chicken,\" \"Bacon Fat\" and \"Cadillac Jack\". He is also the co-author of the R&B hit \"Shake a Tail Feather\".\\n\\nBorn in Bessemer, Alabama, United States, Williams lived in a housing project with his mother until she died when he was six years of age. A sly and smart young boy, his \"aunties\" raised him until he was around 16. He then set out on his own and moved to Detroit, Michigan. There, he became friends with Jack and Devora Brown, owners of Fortune Records which was located at the back of a barber shop. Williams would become label mates with Nolan Strong and Nathaniel Mayer.\\n\\nHe then became lead singer for The 5 Dollars in 1955, which already had a contract with Fortune Records. Though most of the songs were billed as \\'Andre Williams and the Don Juans\\' (on Epic in 1956 billed as \\'Andre Mr Rhythm Williams and his New Group\\'), \"Bacon Fat\" and \"Jail Bait\" were solo efforts. \"Bacon Fat\" hit #9 on the US Billboard R&B chart in 1957. \"Bacon Fat\" (written by Williams) was such a success that Fortune Records sold the song to Epic Records, a much larger distributor (released as Epic 5-9196 \"Bacon Fat/Just because of a Kiss\"). In 1960 Fortune released an album of all of his singles with the Don Juans, which was titled Jail Bait (re-released in 1986). In 1960, he appeared on Motown\\'s Miracle Record label releasing \"Rosa Lee\".\\n\\nIn the early 1960s, Williams co-wrote Stevie Wonder\\'s first song, \"Thank You for Loving Me.\" Williams\\' \"Shake a Tail Feather\" was also a hit in 1963 for the Five Du-Tones and then for Ike & Tina Turner plus James and Bobby Purify.

       " 'Andrea Bocelli (born in 1958 in Lajatico, Tuscany, Italy) is an Italian tenor, multi-instrumentalist and classical crossover artist. Born with poor eyesight, he became blind at the age of twelve following a football accident.\\n\\nA disciple of Luciano Pavarotti and Zucchero Fornaciari, the blind, Tuscany-born, vocalist has emerged as one of the most exciting voices in contemporary opera. His participation in Pavarotti\\'s 1992 hit, Miserere, and Fornaciari\\'s 1993 world tour brought him international attention. Opera, however, represents only one side of his musical persona. Bocelli has been equally successful as a pop ballad singer, having recorded duets with Celine Dion, Sarah Brightman and Eros Ramazzotti. Al Jarreau, who sang with Bocelli during The Night of Proms in November 1995, praised Bocelli when he said, \"I have had the honour to sing with the most beautiful voice in the world.\" Bocelli grew up on a farm in Lajatico, a rural village in Tuscany. Beginning piano lessons at the age of six, he later added flute and saxophone.\\n\\nDespite his obvious musical talents, Bocelli didn\\'t consider a career in music until he had studied law at the University of Pisa and had earned a Doctor Of Law degree. Inspired to pursue music, he studied with famed tenor Franco Corelli, supporting himself by performing in piano bars.\\n\\nBocelli\\'s first break as a singer came in 1992 when Fornaciari auditioned tenors to record a demo tape of Miserere, which he had co-written with Bono of U2. Successfully passing the audition, Bocelli recorded the tune as a duet with Pavarotti.\\n\\nAfter touring with Fornaciari in 1993, Bocelli performed as a guest star in the Pavarotti International festival held in Modena in September 1994. In addition to performing solo and in a duet with Pavarotti, Bocelli sang with Bryan Adams, Andreas Vollenweider and Nancy Gustavsson. In November 1995, Bocelli toured Holland, Belgium, Germany, Spain and France with \"Night Of Proms\", which also featured Al Jarreau, Bryan Ferry, Roger Hodgson of Supertramp and John Miles.\\n\\nBocelli\\'s first two albums -- Il Mare Calmo Della Sera in 1994 and Bocelli in 1996 -- showcased his operatic singing. His third effort, Viaggio Italiano, featured famous arias and traditional songs from Naples. Although released only in Italy, the album sold more than 300,000 copies. With his fourth album, Romanza, released in 1997, Bocelli turned to pop music. The album included the hit, Time to Say Goodbye, recorded as a duet with Sarah Brightman. Bocelli continued to focus on pop balladry with his fifth album, Sogno, released in 1999, which featured a duet with Celine Dion of the David Foster- and Carole Bayer Sager-penned tune, The Prayer, sold more than ten million copies, received a Golden Globe award and led to Bocelli being nominated for a Grammy as \"best new artist\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Andrea+Bocelli\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Her father is Italian and her mother Armenian.\\n\\nShe said that she had been traumatized in her childhood by the divorce of her parents when she was 8, and by the death of her grandfather when she was 16. As she wanted to become a singer, she left school and family at the age of 14.\\n\\nShe had many successive jobs including performances in the piano bars of the French Riviera. At 18, she gave birth to Raphael, her first son. Her repertoire was expanding, with many musical influences and over a thousand songs. In 1993, a first single entitled \"Loin\" was released, but didn\\'t meet  with any commercial success.\\n\\n* A new start\\nAfter her convalescence, she recorded her second album, Au Nom d\\'une femme in 2000. The album topped the charts, and reached Diamond Sales. Five singles from this album were all successfully released. Ségara then began a concert tour that lasted for two years. A video recording of the concert at the Olympia in Paris on this occasion was released. According to a poll made by the IFOP, Segara was at the time the favourite French singer  in her country.\\n\\nIn March 2003 was released a third album, Humaine, including \"On n\\'oublie rien, on vit avec\", a duet with Laura Pausini and \"L\\'Amour est un soleil\", composed by Romano Musumarra. About 700,000 copies of this album were sold. She started another tour in late 2003 but was forced to stop her performances because of a difficult pregnancy.\\n\\nIn August 2003, Ségara married in Ajaccio Mathieu Lecat (son of journalist Didier Lecat), with whom she had two other children: Matteo (born in May 2003) and Maïa (October 2004).\\n\\nHer fourth studio album, Quand l\\'éternité ... came out in 2006. The first single from this album was \"Méfie-toi de moi\", followed by \"Rien n\\'est comme avant\". This album has a different style from previous ones, with more pronounced rock influences, texts almost all composed by the singer, and that addresses issues such as the absence, death and hope. The album eventually achieved gold status three months after its release for more than 200,000 copies sold. In early 2007, she made a new concerts tour in France, including the Palais des Sports in Paris.\\n\\nIn 2007, when she finished the first part of her tour, two other songs from the album were sent to the radio: \"Tu ne seras jamais libre\" and \"Father\". Both songs were not released as singles. In late 2007, several editions came out : a box set with of 3 CDs (Les 50 plus belles chansons d\\'Hélène Segara), two boxes composed of 2 CDs with a new cover (Cœur de verre + Au Nom d\\'une femme, Humaine + Quand l\\'éternité...) and a CD \\'Prestige\\' with 15 tracks. In February 2008, she released \"La Moitié de nous\", a duet with Bruno Pelletier, whose a part of profits were given to an association name Rêves.[3] The tour \"Quand l\\'éternité...\" is ongoing until summer 2008, in France and abroad. This year, Ségara will also record a new album that is described by herself as a \"realistic travel around the world\", with a link between all the songs. This album will be released at the end of the year, before a new international tour, including two concerts at the Olympia on 22 November and 23, 2008. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne+S%C3%A9gara\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Andreas Johnson (born March 22, 1970 in Lund, Sweden) is a Swedish pop musician and songwriter. Born in Lund in the south of Sweden his family moved around the country, finally settling in a Stockholm suburb.\\n\\nIn 1993, He started his musical career as the singer in Planet Waves, a group which released only one album, Brutal Awakenings before splitting up due to internal conflicts. He then turned to a solo career, releasing the debut solo album Cottonfish Tales. In 1999, he had an international hit with the single Glorious, which later featured on the album Liebling, which has been used in a number of advertisements including Volvo, Nutella and Vauxhall. Deadly Happy, his third solo album, was released in 2002, and Mr Johnson, Your Room Is On Fire was released in 2005. 2007 he gave out a greatest hits CD called The Collector.\\n\\nBio from the poet site written by Unbry, Mysty and Bending:\\n\\nMarch 22nd, 1970 - Lund, Southern Sweden: a wonderful baby starts to let the world hear his phenomenal voice: his name is JON ERIK ANDREAS JOHNSON. His mummy is called Marie, his daddy Gigge; they\\'re both jazz musicians. He also has an older brother called Olof who\\'s now a lawyer. Since they were children, the Johnson brothers have travelled throughout the world with their parents, always in a tour: \"I\\'ve grown up on the stage, surrounded by instruments, scores and dressing-rooms sometimes not decent. [...] I was the group\\'s mascot and to joke or because I liked it, I always ended up with taking a microphone in my hands, often on daddy\\'s knees...\" Music becomes a natural yearning for Andreas: as a kid he used to fall asleep listening to his mother singing jazz songs instead of traditional lullabies, believe it or not! In his early teens he moves with his family in a Stockholm suburb: \"There was not so much to do, I only had three choices: sport, drugs or music and I chose the last!\". He starts joining small bands and making his first experiences; his first band Silver Arrow made its debut in an assembly-hall at school \"It was my first gig ever, It ended up with that I and the two guitarists went up and played without drummer. The guitarists were so nervous that they played with their back against the public\". But his parents disagree with him having seen many friends quitting their musical career pretty soon. \"So you don\\'t want me to be in the music world? I\\'ll prove you wrong!\"\\n\\nAndreas releases his first album with Planet Waves, \"Brutal Awakenings\", published by EMI only in Scandinavia. The band seems to take inspiration from Bob Dylan, and also the title is the same of a Dylan\\'s album (Andreas will later confess that they didn\\'t actually know anything about that album!). Between 1993 and 1995 love brings him with the band to New York, where he finds his first personal inspirations for his songs; back in Stockholm the band splits up \"We didn’t come to agree. It became a total conflict. Also physical confrontations, fights\".\\n\\nUnder the American influence Andreas releases, again with EMI and only in Scandinavia, his first solo album, \"Cottonfish Tales\". And here problems begin, he fight with EMI because they don\\'t give him enough freedom, he takes a period off in Berlin and in this magic city the new album \"Liebling\" starts to breathe in only 2-3 months.\\n\\nThe album is dedicated to Debbie Starlight, mysterious inspiring muse, dead before her time but somehow still present in his songs\\' sounds. Italy brings inspiration too: he spends a couple of weeks in Porto Ercole, Tuscany, and, inspired by green Tuscanian hills, he writes 8 songs, 3 included in the album (the last three). As a final gift he gets a new contract with another recording house, WEA. Tales say that when Andreas went to WEA he brought with him three sample songs in DAT format, but the player jammed right at the proof moment; he took a guitar and decided to make a live performance, with an acoustic version of \"The Games We Play\": the editor was immediately crazy about it and signed the contract the same day! The POET\\'s talent strikes back!\\n\\nAfter the album conclusion, comes the single choice: for about two weeks Andreas and his band try to choose a song to be released as a single, but everyone has his own favourite and the choice is not easy; in the end the album opening song is chosen: \"Glorious\". In Gothenburg, during the first months of 1999, in an old dismissed gas container, Karl-Johan Larsson directs the video of \"Glorious\"; in interviews Andreas always says that it was \"quite frightful: I was 80 metres above the ground and we were even without permissions!\". The song is published just before summer, but it doesn\\'t reach immediate success: \"This song is too distressing for summertime\" the POET says. But during autumn it becomes the biggest success of the season: it reaches the third place in Italian singles chart and also the fourth place in the \"difficult\" English chart, which is a quite good result for a debut single! Andreas receives two nominees for the Swedish Grammy Awards, as best single and best video for 1999. Critics unanimously recognise that \"Glorious\" is \"the most beautiful song of the last decade\". Concerts in Germany, England, Spain and Sweden are always sold out.\\n\\n..At the end of 1999 the new single, \"The Games We Play\", is published in Sweden, reaching 7th place in the chart. Unsatisfied with the video shot in Praga, Andreas decides to shoot a new version during the weekend 4-5 march 2000, with the same director of \"Glorious\", Karl-Johan Larsson, and again in Gothenburg waiting for the new single to be published in the rest of Europe on May 15..\\n\\n..In Autumn 2000 “People” video was ready and directed by Karl-Johan Larsson too in Kiev/Ukraina. At our advise the best video of our POET..\\n\\n..After a long European tour from 1999 till Autumn 2000 till the presentation of the best hip hop MTV Europe Award, a long working period gets him ready to conquer the world..\\n\\n...15/12/01 he is ready to enter in all charts with the new single Shine.

       " '\\nAndrew Maurice Gold (August 2, 1951 – June 3, 2011) was an American singer, songwriter, musician and arranger. His works include the Top 10 single \"Lonely Boy\" (1977), as well as \"Thank You for Being a Friend\" (1978) and \"Never Let Her Slip Away\" (1978).\\n\\nGold was a multi-instrumentalist who played guitar, bass, keyboards, accordion, synthesizer, harmonica, saxophone, flute, drums and percussion, as well as more arcane musical devices such as ukulele, musette, and harmonium. He was also a producer, sound engineer, film composer, session musician, actor, and painter.\\n\\nThroughout the years, he played and/or sang on records and/or live performances with artists including Carly Simon, Jennifer Warnes, Linda Ronstadt, Stephen Bishop, Nicolette Larson, Maria Muldaur, Neil Diamond, Barbi Benton, Juice Newton, Leo Sayer, The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Karla Bonoff, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, John Lennon, Frankie Valli/Four Seasons , Brian Wilson, James Taylor, Roy Orbison, Don Henley, Bette Midler, Diana Ross, Cher, Jesse McCartney and J.D. Souther.\\n\\nGold was born in Burbank, California, and eventually followed his parents into show business. His mother is singer Marni Nixon (who provided the singing voice for numerous actresses, notably Natalie Wood in West Side Story, Deborah Kerr in The King and I, and Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady); his father was Ernest Gold, the Austrian-born, Academy Award-winning composer for the movie Exodus. He has two younger sisters.\\n\\nGold began writing songs at the age of 13. Abroad in England for school, the 16-year old Gold scored his first recording contract on the strength of a selection of demos he submitted to Polydor Records’ London office. That contract resulted in the single \"Of All the Little Girls,\" which was recorded with his friend and collaborator Charlie Villiers, and released in 1967 under the name Villiers and Gold.\\n\\nCareer\\n\\n1970–79\\n\\nBy the early 1970s, Gold was working full-time as a musician, songwriter and record producer. He was a member of the Los Angeles band Bryndle, alongside Kenny Edwards, Wendy Waldman and Karla Bonoff, releasing the single \"Woke Up This Morning\" in 1970. He played a major role as multi-instrumentalist and arranger for Linda Ronstadt\\'s breakthrough album, 1974\\'s Heart Like a Wheel, and her next four albums. Among other accomplishments, he played the majority of instruments on \"You\\'re No Good,\" Ronstadt\\'s first #1 single on the Billboard Hot 100, and the same on \"When Will I Be Loved,\" \"Heat Wave\" and many other classic hits. He was in her band from 1973 until 1977, and then sporadically throughout the 1980s and 1990s.\\n\\nIn 1975, Gold began recording as a solo artist, releasing four studio albums in the 1970s and over twelve since then. His hit single \"Lonely Boy\" reached #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in June 1977 and has appeared in a number of film soundtracks, including Boogie Nights in 1997 and Adam Sandler\\'s 1998 movie The Waterboy, among others. In February 2000, the American rock band Foo Fighters recorded a cover of the song to be used as a B-side for an upcoming single off their 1999 album There Is Nothing Left to Lose; however, it wasn\\'t used as planned. On Marc Maron\\'s January 17, 2013 WTF podcast, Foo Fighters leader Dave Grohl said that the band\\'s cover of \"Lonely Boy\" would eventually be released as the A-side of a special \"Solid Gold\" 45 rpm single with a Foo Fighters version of Gold\\'s \"Never Let Her Slip Away\" as the B-side.\\n\\nAlthough \"Lonely Boy\" was the bigger radio hit in the States, his single \"Thank You for Being a Friend\" (which peaked at #25 in 1978) later gained popularity as the theme song for the 1985–92 NBC situation comedy The Golden Girls (performed by Cindy Fee for the show). \"Thank You for Being a Friend\" has also shown up in places as diverse as an episode of the long-running animated TV situation comedy The Simpsons, a 2013 Super Bowl ad for the National Football League,[10] and an audio file in various musical greeting cards. Gold\\'s biggest UK hit was \"Never Let Her Slip Away,\" which made it to #5 twice on the British singles charts, once by him and again 14 years later by dance-pop group Undercover. Freddie Mercury, who was a friend of Gold\\'s, assisted him with sparse harmony vocals as an uncredited background singer. Among the artists recording Gold\\'s material was British singer Petula Clark who covered \"Lonely Boy\" in French (\"Poor Lonesome Playboy\") on her Paris, Orleans, Paris album. In 1976, Gold wrote the title track \"Endless Flight\" for singer Leo Sayer\\'s hit album.\\n\\n1975 also marked a successful collaboration with Art Garfunkel, wherein Gold played most of the instruments on Garfunkel\\'s solo hit \"I Only Have Eyes For You\" (which went to #1 on the UK Singles Chart), as well as several other cuts on Garfunkel\\'s album Breakaway. That year, Gold also played guitar on two cuts of Eric Carmen\\'s album Boats Against the Current, including \"She Did It,\" which was a #23 hit that same year.[17] Gold toured with the Eagles; worked in the recording studio and toured with Jackson Browne; played and sang on record and toured with James Taylor; and was second engineer on part of Joni Mitchell\\'s Blue album.\\n\\n1980–2011\\n\\nIn 1981, Gold produced, co-wrote, sang and played on three 10cc tracks that appeared the hit-making pop-rock band\\'s 1981 album Ten Out of 10. Subsequently, Eric Stewart and Graham Gouldman of 10cc invited Gold to become a member of the group. Although he had worked with them in the studio, business conflicts prevented him from joining up. In late 1983, 10cc broke up, and in the aftermath, Gold and Gouldman formed Wax. Wax recorded and toured for five years. They enjoyed international success, particularly in the U.K. where the duo had several Top 10 hits including \"Right Between the Eyes\" and their biggest hit \"Bridge to Your Heart\". Wax broke up as a recording and touring entity in 1989, but Gold and Gouldman continued to write and record together when possible.\\n\\nGold played on Cher\\'s hit 1989 album Heart of Stone, and, during the early \\'90s, wrote hits for Trisha Yearwood as well as Wynonna Judd for whom he co-wrote the #1 single \"I Saw The Light\" with Lisa Angelle. (Later, Gold would produce Angelle on her own album, which featured a number of songs they co-authored.) He also produced singles for Vince Gill, wrote and produced tracks for Celine Dion, and arranged a cover of the Everly Brothers\\' hit “All I Have to Do Is Dream\" that was sung by stars Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen in the 1984 science-fiction film Starman.\\n\\nIn the 1990s, Gold once again joined forces with ex-bandmates Karla Bonoff, Wendy Waldman and Kenny Edwards to re-form Bryndle and finally release their first full-length album, Bryndle. In 1996, Gold left Bryndle and released the children\\'s holiday-oriented novelty album Halloween Howls. The same year, he released the solo album ....Since 1951, and produced Stephen Bishop\\'s Blue Guitar album. Thereafter, he recorded the psychedelic \\'60s tribute album Greetings from Planet Love under the pseudonym The Fraternal Order Of The All, and released it on his own record label QBrain Records. This album was a multi-tracked solo affair with Gold essentially playing all of the instruments and singing all of the vocals on original songs in the style of Gold\\'s favorite 1960s bands such as The Beatles, The Byrds and The Beach Boys. He produced, composed, and/or wrote tracks for numerous films, such as the comedy Rectuma from director Mark Pirro, and contributed songs to many television soundtracks and commercials. Among his more high-profile gigs, he sang \"Final Frontier,\" the theme song for the television sitcom Mad About You. In a remarkable turn of events, his rendition of the song was used as the wake-up call for the Mars Pathfinder space probe in 1996.[18] Gold also produced seven albums for Japanese singer-songwriter Eikichi Yazawa.\\n\\nDuring 2000, Gold compiled a Wax rarities album, Wax Bikini, as well as recording and releasing a new solo album The Spence Manor Suite - which was followed in 2002 by another solo collection Intermission. He appeared in a 2006 concert with the classic rock group America, and the performance was later released as a DVD entitled \"America And Friends - Live at the Ventura Theater.\" The show featured Gold performing \"Thank You for Being a Friend,\" \"Final Frontier,\" \"Bridge to Your Heart\" and \"Lonely Boy,\" as well as accompanying America and fellow guest artist Stephen Bishop on guitar and vocals.

       " 'Andrew Roy Gibb (March 5, 1958 – March 10, 1988) was an English-born Australian singer and teen idol, and the younger brother of Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb, also known as the Bee Gees.\\n\\nThe Early Years\\nHe was born Andrew Roy Gibb in Manchester, England, to Hugh and Barbara Gibb. His family immigrated to Australia within months of his birth, settling in Redcliffe, Queensland, near Brisbane.\\n\\nGibb began playing at tourist clubs around Spain\\'s coastal Island of Ibiza, and later back in his homeland of Britain on the Isle of Man, as a young teenager. The idea of his joining the Bee Gees was often suggested, but the age gap between him and his elder brothers (more than 11 years younger than Barry, slightly more than eight years younger than twins Robin and Maurice) made this difficult to achieve.\\n\\nAfter returning to Australia in 1975 to hone his craft as a singer and songwriter, Gibb began recording a series of his own compositions, one of which was released as a single on the ATA label, owned by veteran Australian performer, Col Joye. \"Words and Music\" would eventually reach Top Five on the Sydney music charts in 1976. This breakout would pave the way to an even greater milestone later that year — an invitation from Robert Stigwood (who, at the time, was also the Bee Gees\\' manager) to launch his international career signed to his label, RSO Records. Gibb soon moved to Miami Beach, Florida to begin working on songs with his brother Barry, and co-producers Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson.\\n\\nPrior to leaving Australia, Gibb had married his girlfriend, Kim Reeder. They had one child, a daughter named Peta. Their marriage ended in 1978, his work and family commitments having come between them. Notwithstanding, Gibb\\'s personal trials were soon overshadowed by fame and recognition.\\n\\nRise to the Top\\nIn the United States, Gibb became the first male solo artist to chart three consecutive Number One singles on the Billboard Hot 100. In July of 1977, he had his first major hit, \"I Just Want to Be Your Everything\", a song written by his brother Barry, just as his first album Flowing Rivers broke into the US Top 20, on its way to selling over a million copies. The album\\'s second single \"(Love Is) Thicker Than Water\" broke in early 1978 amidst the commercial explosion caused by his brothers\\' contributions to the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack, replacing \"Stayin\\' Alive\" at the top of the US charts, and then surpassed by \"Night Fever\" when it reached the summit in mid-March.\\n \\nContinuing the momentum of his first successes, Gibb began work with the Gibb-Galuten-Richardson production team on his second album Shadow Dancing. The title track, written by all four Gibb brothers, was released as a single in the US in April 1978, and in mid-June began a seven week run at Number One, achieving platinum status. Two further Top Ten singles, \"An Everlasting Love\" and \"(Our Love) Don\\'t Throw It All Away\", a cover of the earlier version by his brothers, were extracted from the album, which became another million seller.\\n\\nDespite his impressive accomplishments, the pressures and excesses of such rapid success began to consume Gibb, and eventually he would succumb to drug addiction and the reality of a career in decline. In 1979, Gibb performed, along with the Bee Gees, ABBA, and Olivia Newton-John (duet with \"Rest Your Love On Me\"), at the Music for UNICEF Concert at the United Nations General Assembly, broadcast worldwide.\\n\\nHe returned to the studio to begin recording sessions for his final full studio album, After Dark. With drugs impeding his previous ability to write and even fully sing the tracks on his own record, Gibb was only able to forge his performance with nearly intrusive support from brother Barry.[citation needed] In March of 1980 the last of Gibb\\'s Top Ten singles charted just ahead of the album\\'s release. \"Desire\", was recorded for the Bee Gees\\' 1979 album Spirits Having Flown, and featured their original track with Gibb\\'s lead vocal dubbed in. A second single, \"I Can\\'t Help It\", a duet with family friend Olivia Newton-John, which they had performed at the UN, reached the Top Twenty; they donated the royalties to UNICEF.\\n\\nLater in the year, Andy Gibb\\'s Greatest Hits was released as a finale to his contract with RSO Records, with two new songs: \"Time Is Time\" (number 15 in January 1981) and \"Me (Without You)\" (Gibb\\'s last Top Forty chart entry) shipped as singles.\\n\\nCareer Stall Out\\nA well-publicised affair with actress Victoria Principal ensued, while Gibb signed to several projects outside of the recording studio, including acclaimed performances in Andrew Lloyd Webber\\'s Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat on Broadway, Gilbert & Sullivan\\'s The Pirates of Penzance in Los Angeles, and a short-term stint as co-host of the television music show Solid Gold.\\n\\nHowever, as Gibb\\'s drug use intensified, he was unable to commit to regular performances and tapings, and was eventually removed from each of these endeavours. His romance with Principal also ended a short time later, but not before recording and releasing a vanity duet of the Everly Brothers\\' classic \"All I Have To Do Is Dream\". This would be Gibb\\'s last official single, and his last US chart entry, peaking at number 51.\\n\\nHis family convinced him to seek treatment for his drug addiction; after a stint at the Betty Ford Clinic in the mid-1980s, Gibb toured small venues with a stage show of his greatest hits and covers, and appeared in guest-starring roles on several television situation comedies. His performances showed him to have seemingly recovered from his addiction. But although his performances in his new lifestyle were well-received, they failed to return him to the height of his past successes. In 1987, with his debts far outweighing his income, Gibb was forced to declare bankruptcy.\\n\\nDetermined to revive his recording career, Gibb returned to work alongside brothers Barry and Maurice. They produced a series of demo recordings, which would eventually secure him a contract with the UK branch of Island Records. One of the demos, \"Man On Fire\", was released posthumously on the 1991 Polydor anthology, Andy Gibb, while another demo, \"Arrow Through The Heart\", though unreleased to the present day, would be featured on an episode of VH1\\'s series Behind the Music.\\n\\nDeath\\nHe travelled to England to fulfill the label\\'s request for more songs, moving into brother Robin\\'s estate in Thame, Oxfordshire. He turned to drinking heavily, and fell ill. On March 7, 1988, Andy was taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford complaining of stomach pains.\\n\\nGibb died three days later of myocarditis — a sudden inflammation of the heart muscle caused by a viral infection. While his years of alcohol and cocaine abuse did not directly result in his death, they did aggravate the condition.\\n\\nHis body was brought back to Los Angeles, California, for interment in Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery.

       " 'Olivia Newton-John AC DBE (born in Cambridge on 26 September 1948; died 8 August 2022) was a British-born Australian-raised singer, songwriter, actress, entrepreneur and activist. She was a four-time Grammy Award winner whose music career included five number-one hits and another ten top-ten hits on the US Billboard Hot 100, and two Billboard 200 number-one albums, If You Love Me, Let Me Know (1974) and Have You Never Been Mellow (1975). Eleven of her singles (including two Platinum) and 14 of her albums (including two Platinum and four 2× Platinum) have been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). With global sales of more than 100 million records, Newton-John is one of the best-selling music artists from the second half of the 20th century to the present.\\n\\nThe youngest child of Professor Brin Newton-John and Irene, daughter of Nobel Prize winning physicist, Max Born, Newton-John moved to Melbourne, Australia, with her family when she was five. By the age of fifteen, she had formed an all-girl group called Sol Four. Later that year she won a talent contest on the popular TV show, “Sing, Sing, Sing,” which earned her a trip to London. By 1963, Newton-John was appearing on local daytime TV shows and weekly pop music programs in Australia. She cut her first single for Decca Records in 1966, a version of Jackie DeShannon’s \"Till You Say You’ll Be Mine.\" In 1971, she recorded a cover of Bob Dylan’s \"If Not For You,\" co-produced by John Farrar, with whom she continued to collaborate. \\n\\nHer 1973 U.S. album debut, \"Let Me Be There,\" produced her first top ten single of the same name, with Newton-John being honored by the Academy Of Country Music as Most Promising Female Vocalist and a Grammy Award as Best Country Vocalist. This proved to be only the beginning of a very exciting career. Her countless successes include three more Grammys, numerous Country Music Awards, American Music Awards and Peoples Choice Awards, five 1 hits including “Physical,” which topped the charts for ten consecutive weeks, and 15 top 10 singles. \\n\\nIn 1978, her co-starring role with John Travolta in “Grease” catapulted Newton-John into super-stardom. This film led to the production of the most successful movie musical soundtrack in history, featuring the duets \"You’re The One That I Want\" and \"Summer Nights,\" with Travolta, as well as her mega-hit, \"Hopelessly Devoted To You.\" The film was re-released worldwide in 1998 in celebration of its 20th anniversary to even more acclaim, a true testament to the film’s timeless quality. Her other film credits include “Xanadu,” “Two Of A Kind,” “It’s My Party,” and “Sordid Lives.” She followed that success, by co-starring with her daughter, Chloe, in the Showtime movie, “The Wilde Girls.” Clearly following in her mother’s footsteps, Chloe has recently signed her first record label contract. \\n\\nNewton-John appeal was boundless. With a career spanning more than three decades she was adored by fans across the world. Throughout her career, the much-loved star, who danced with Gene Kelly in “Xanadu,” hosted the popular internationally syndicated “Wild Life” television show, was bestowed an O.B.E. (Order Of The British Empire) by Queen Elizabeth in 1979, has held many humanitarian causes close to her heart, particularly since the birth of her daughter Chloe in 1986. She served as Goodwill Ambassador to the United Nations Environment Programme and in 1991, the Colette Chuda Environmental Fund/CHEC (Children’s Health Environ-mental Coalition) was founded after the tragic death of Chloe’s best friend from a rare childhood cancer, with Olivia serving as National Spokesperson for ten years. Newton-John’s devotion and shared commitment to CHEC’s mission and goals enabled the organization to receive worldwide attention and support. (For more information visit www.CHECnet.org.) \\n\\nHer charmed life has not been without its share of upset. In the 90s, Newton-John successfully overcame her own battle with breast cancer, which inspired her self-penned and produced album, “GAIA,” her most personal album reflecting upon her experiences with cancer. She used these experiences to gain greater self-awareness and became a positive inspiration to millions of people battling cancer. As a breast cancer survivor, Newton-John became increasingly well known and respected for talking openly about her battle with breast cancer and for promoting public awareness of the importance of early detection. Her personal victory against cancer led her to announce her partnership with the Austin & Repatriation Medical Centre and the creation of the “Olivia Newton-John Cancer Centre” (ONJCC) on the Austin Campus in her hometown, Melbourne, Australia. The ONJCC will provide a comprehensive range of services and facilities for cancer treatment, education, training and research. (For more information visit www.armc.org.au.) \\n\\nNewton-John was acknowledged many times by charitable and environmental organizations for her ongoing efforts, among them: the American Red Cross, the Environmental Media Association, the Women’s Guild of Cedar’s Sinai Medical Center, the Rainforest Alliance and Concept Cure. Olivia promotes breast health awareness and has introduced the “Olivia Breast Self-Exam Kit,” an aid to help women perform self-exams with more ease and confidence (www.liv.com). \\n\\nIn the 2000\\'s, her interational recognition continued to grow. She was invited by the Vatican on behalf of Pope John Paul II to perform at the Jubilee Celebration for the Sick and Healthcare Workers. Olivia was thrilled to perform at the Opening Ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Olympics to an estimated global viewing audience of four billion people. Adding to this Olympic experience is what Olivia feels is one of her most memorable moments – the honor of carrying the Olympic Torch during the Olympic Torch Relay. Her passion for Australia was ignited again when Olivia reunited with friend and business partner, Pat Farrar, to promote the Koala Blue brand with distinctly Australian wines to proudly bring “the taste of Australia” to the rest of the world. Her healing spirit also led to the opening of the GAIA Retreat & Spa in her homeland of Australia (www.GaiaRetreat.com.au). \\n\\nIn 1999, her album, \"Back With A Heart,\" garnered her an Emmy Award for her songwriting. In 2000/2001, Olivia released her only live album, \"One Woman’s Live Journey,\" followed by “Magic - The Very Best of Olivia Newton-John,” which celebrated thirty years of recording. And if that wasn’t enough, she also released her first holiday album, “The Christmas Collection.” In 2002, a CD of duets simply titled, “2,” was recorded in Australia and features a host of talented Ozzies along with a couple of her American friends, followed by “Indigo: Women of Song,” a tribute to some of her favorite female performers. \\n\\nThe CD “Stronger Than Before,” release in 2005, features songs of inspiration, courage and hope that relate to the complex emotions cancer patients and their loved ones experience. A portion of the CD’s proceeds benefit cancer research. \\n\\nHer recording, “Grace and Gratitude,” a CD for relaxation to promote spiritual balance and physical and emotional healing, was released in September 2006 and coincided with the launch of Newton-John\\'s wellness products for women. \\n\\nIn 2002, Newton-John was inducted into the prestigious Australian Music Hall Of Fame at the 16th Annual Aria Awards. Her latest honors include receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award by friend John Travolta at the G’Day L.A. Ball in 2006. \\n\\nNewton-John was also appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia by the Queen for her “service to the entertainment industry as a singer and actor, and to the community through organizations supporting breast cancer treatment, education and training research, and the environment.” \\n\\nWesite www.OliviaNewton-John.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Olivia+Newton-John\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They wrote more songs for the Archies, and also for Changes, by The Monkees in 1970, which Barry produced.\\n\\nOver the next few years, Kim recorded a few minor hits and toured North America extensively. In the fall of 1974, he released \"Rock Me Gently\", which went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and rose to #2 on the UK Singles Chart.\\n\\nBy the end of 1976, Kim stopped recording and disappeared from public life. He returned under the stage name \\'Baron Longfellow\\' with a self-titled album in 1980 and, also under the same pseudonym, in 1984 released Prisoner by Design. Both of these albums met with moderate success. In 1991, Kim again went by the name \\'Longfellow\\' and recorded the single \"Powerdrive\", which received radio airplay on several radio stations across Canada.\\n\\nIn 1995, Kim played at the Kumbaya Festival at which the Barenaked Ladies were also performing. Nearly a decade later, the band\\'s Ed Robertson convinced Kim to come out of retirement.[1][2] Robertson co-wrote the song \"I Forgot to Mention\" with him and offered to produce the track. The single was released on a 5-track EP in 2004 which included a re-recording of \"Powerdrive\".\\n\\nIn March 2005, Kim received the annual \"Indie Award\" for Favorite Solo Artist during Canadian Music Week.[1] The music video for \"Love Is...\", released in the summer of 2005, reached #1 at Bravo.ca. In 2005, he co-wrote \"What Ever Happened To Christmas\" with Ron Sexsmith.[1] The same year, he established the Andy Kim Christmas Show - a live concert at the Mod Club in Toronto in which a variety of artists were invited to perform mostly Christmas music. Kim\\'s band acted as house band for the artists, who donated their time for the show. Proceeds were donated to the CHUM/CITY Christmas Wish. The show repeated in 2006, with a similar lineup. Proceeds from the show went to support the Children\\'s Aid Foundation, and the edited show was aired on Mix 99.9 on Christmas Eve and Day.\\n\\nMore recently, Kim\\'s music has again come into the public eye, as his single \"Rock Me Gently\" was sped up slightly and used by Jeep for their Jeep Liberty commercial - \\'Pouring In\\'. His name can be seen on the radio display near the beginning of the commercial.\\n\\n\\n[edit] Greatest hits\\n\"Baby, I Love You\" 1969 (U.S. #9, West Germany #20) \\n\"So Good Together\" 1969 (U.S. #36, West Germany #37) \\n\"Be My Baby\" 1970 (U.S. #17, West Germany #24) \\n\"Rock Me Gently\" 1974 (U.S. #1, UK #2, West Germany  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Andy+Kim\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Taylor Alison Swift is an American singer-songwriter. Her discography spans multiple genres, and her narrative songwriting, which is often inspired by her personal life, has received widespread media coverage and critical praise.\\n\\nBorn in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift relocated to Nashville, Tennessee in 2004 to pursue a career in country music. She broke into the country music scene with her eponymous self-titled debut studio album, \"Taylor Swift\" in 2006, which included the singles \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" and \"Our Song\". Swift also released the holiday album, Sounds of the Season: The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection, later titled as \"The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection\" in October 2007.\\n\\nSwift rose to mainstream prominence with her second studio album, \"Fearless\" (2008), a country pop record with crossover appeal. Aided by the top-five singles \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\", Fearless was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Swift\\'s third studio album, \"Speak Now\" (2010), blended country pop with elements of rock and featured the top-ten singles \"Mine\" and \"Back to December\". \\n\\nDrawing inspiration from various pop, rock, and electronic genres, Swift\\'s fourth studio album \"Red\" (2012) saw her transcending her country roots. She completely moved to pop with her synth-pop fifth studio album, \"1989\" (2014), and expanded the electropop sound on her next two studio albums, \"reputation\" (2017) and \"Lover\" (2019), which respectively embraced urban and retro styles. The four albums spawned a string of international top-five singles, including \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", \"I Knew You Were Trouble\", \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", \"Bad Blood\", \"Look What You Made Me Do\", \"ME! (feat. Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco)\", \"You Need to Calm Down\", and \"Lover\". \\n\\nIn the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift experimented with folk and alternative rock on her eighth and ninth studio albums, \"folklore\" and \"evermore\" (both 2020), whose lead singles \"cardigan\" and \"willow\" topped charts around the world. She also released the critically acclaimed documentaries Miss Americana and Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions that year. Swift\\'s tenth studio album Midnights (2022) marked her triumphant return to pop after two folk albums. The album set the record for biggest first day and first week ever on Spotify, spawned the hits Anti-Hero and Lavender Haze, and sold over 1.5 million copies in its first week becoming not only the biggest debut of the decade but also Swift\\'s biggest debut ever. She would make history by becoming the first artist to occupy the entire top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 with tracks from Midnights. \\n\\nSwift began re-recording her back catalog in November 2020, as a result of a publicized dispute with talent manager Scooter Braun and her former label Big Machine, regarding the acquisition of the masters of her back catalog. In April 2021, Swift released a re-recorded issue of her 2008 album Fearless, titled \"Fearless (Taylor\\'s Version)\". It debuted at number one in the US. Swift continued releasing re-recorded versions of her back catalog in November, 2021 with the release of Red (Taylor\\'s Version), a 30 track re-issue of her 2012 critical smash. The album debuted at #1 in the US, spawned the #1 hit All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor\\'s Version) (From the Vault), and broke the record at the time for biggest first day for a female album on Spotify. Red (Taylor\\'s Version) was a critical and commercial hit, and proved that Swift\\'s ambitious plan to re-record her first 6 albums was well worth it. \\n\\nAlong with the release of Red (Taylor\\'s Version) came All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), Swift\\'s filmmaking debut. The 15 minute romantic drama was based on the lyrical content from Swift\\'s 2012 fan favorite \"All Too Well\" starring Sadie Sink and Dylan O\\'Brien. It had a limited theatrical release in major cities, and Swift held special screenings of the film throughout 2022 at various film festivals. In December, 2022 Taylor announced that she would be making her feature directorial debut with Oscar-winning studio Searchlight Pictures. \\n\\nSwift has released several songs for film soundtracks. She co-wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack— \"You\\'ll Always Find Your Way Back Home\" and \"Crazier\", and contributed two songs to the Valentine\\'s Day soundtrack, including the single \"Today Was a Fairytale\", which was her first number one on the Canadian Hot 100, and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. She also contributed two original songs to The Hunger Games soundtrack album: \"Safe & Sound - from The Hunger Games Soundtrack\", co-written and recorded with The Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett, and \"Eyes Open\". \"Safe & Sound\" won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In 2013, Swift recorded \"Sweeter than Fiction\", a song she wrote and produced with Jack Antonoff for the One Chance film soundtrack, which received a Best Original Song nomination at the 71st Golden Globe Awards. Swift and English singer Zayn Malik, mononymously known as Zayn, released a single together, \"I Don\\'t Wanna Live Forever\", for the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Darker (2017). She also recorded an original song called \"Beautiful Ghosts\", which she wrote with Andrew Lloyd Webber for the Cats\\'s soundtrack (2019). In 2020, Swift\\'s documentary Miss Americana featured the song \"Only the Young\" which was written after the 2018 United States elections. In 2022, she released an original song titled \"Carolina\" for Where The Crawdads Sing (2022) inspired by the novel written by Delia Owens. \\n\\nWith sales of over 200 million records worldwide, Swift is a best-selling music artist. Her accolades include 11 Grammy Awards (including three Album of the Year wins), two Brit Awards (including a Global Icon award), an Emmy Award, 28 [https://guinnessworldrecords.com/]Guinness World Records, 32 American Music Awards (the most wins by an artist), and 23 Billboard Music Awards (the most wins by a woman).

In the 1970s, he made a number of experimental records that were appreciated by small audiences, and scored a commercial hit with \"Avenging Annie\".\\n\\nAfter words of praise from Rolling Stone magazine (\"By reviving the dream of rock as an art and then re-inventing it, Pratt has forever changed the face of rock\"), he tried a more commercial approach.

       " '\\nHoward Andrew Williams (born December 3, 1927 in Wall Lake, Iowa, died September 26, 2012), known as Andy Williams, is an American pop singer.\\n\\nHe first performed in a children\\'s choir at his local Presbyterian church. Williams and his three older brothers Bob, Dick, and Don, formed a quartet, the Williams Brothers, in the late 1930s.  The brothers performed on radio in the Midwest, first at WHO in Des Moines, Iowa, and later at WLS in Chicago and WLW in Cincinnati. Williams graduated from Western Hills High School in Cincinnati. They appeared with Bing Crosby on the hit record \"Swinging on a Star\" (1944). This led to a nightclub act with entertainer Kay Thompson from 1947 to 1951.\\n\\nWilliams\\'s solo career began in 1952 after his brothers left the act. He recorded six sides for RCA\\'s label \"X,\" but none of them were popular hits. After landing a spot as a regular on Steve Allen\\'s Tonight Show in 1955, he was signed to a recording contract with Cadence Records, a small label in New York run by conductor Archie Bleyer. His third single, \"Canadian Sunset\" (1956) hit the Top Ten, and was soon followed his only Billboard #1 hit, \"Butterfly\" (a cover of a Charlie Gracie record on which Williams imitated Elvis Presley). More hits followed, including \"The Hawaiian Wedding Song,\" \"Are You Sincere,\" \"The Village of St. Bernadette,\" and \"Lonely Street,\" before Williams moved to Columbia Records in 1961, having moved from New York to Los Angeles. In terms of chart popularity, the Cadence era was Williams\\'s peak although songs he introduced on Columbia became much bigger standards. Two top ten hits from the Cadence era, \"Butterfly\" and \"I Like Your Kind of Love\" were apparently believed to not suit Williams\\'s later style; they were not included on a Columbia reissue of his Cadence greatest hits in the 1960s.\\n\\nDuring the 1960s, Williams became one of the most popular vocalists in the country and signed what was to that time the biggest recording contract in history. He was primarily an album artist, and at one time he had earned more gold albums than any solo performer except Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. By 1973 he had earned as many as 17 gold album awards. Among his hit albums from this period were Moon River, Days of Wine and Roses (number one for 16 weeks in mid-1963), The Andy Williams Christmas Album, Dear Heart, The Shadow of Your Smile, Love, Andy, Get Together with Andy Williams, and Love Story. In these recordings Williams displays an incredible vocal technique along with an uncanny ability to make each song his very own, often rivaling or surpassing the version by the original artist. These attributes, along with his natural affinity for the music of the 1960s and early 1970s, combined to make him one of the premier easy listening singers of that era.\\n\\nWilliams forged an indirect collaborative relationship with Henry Mancini, although they never recorded together. Williams was asked to sing Mancini and Johnny Mercer\\'s song \"Moon River\" at the 1962 Oscar Awards (where it won), and it quickly became Williams\\'s theme song. This was repeated the next year with the pair\\'s \"Days of Wine and Roses\" (which also won), Mancini\\'s \"Dear Heart\" at the 1965 awards and \"The Sweetheart Tree\" (also written with Mercer) at the 1966 awards.\\n\\nWilliams also competed in the teenage-oriented singles market as well and had several charting hits including \"Can\\'t Get Used to Losing You,\" \"Happy Heart,\" and \"Where Do I Begin\", the theme song from the 1970 blockbuster film, Love Story. Building on his experience with Allen and some short-term variety shows in the 1950s, he became the star of his own weekly television variety show in 1962. This series, The Andy Williams Show, won three Emmy Awards for outstanding variety program. Among his series regulars were the Osmond Brothers. He gave up the variety show in 1971 while it was still popular and retrenched to three specials per year. His Christmas specials, which appeared regularly until 1974 and intermittently from 1982 into the 1990s, were among the most popular of the genre. Williams has recorded eight Christmas albums over the years. He hosted the Grammy Awards for three consecutive years in the 1970s. He returned to television to do a syndicated half-hour series in 1976-77.\\n\\nIn the early 1990s, Williams gave up most of his touring schedule in order to open his own theatre in Branson, Missouri, the Andy Williams Moon River Theater. He continues to do 8 to 12 shows a week from September to December and occasionally makes tours of Europe earlier in the year.\\n\\nHis 1967 recording of \"Music to Watch Girls By\" was a surprise UK hit in 1999, when it reached number 9 after featuring in an advert (beating the original peak of number 33 in 1967). In 2002 he took part in a new duet of \"Can\\'t Take My Eyes Off You\" with British actress and singer Denise van Outen. Nearly everything Williams ever recorded has now been made available on CD through a series of compilations from 1997 to 2004.\\n\\nWilliams met Claudine Longet when he pulled over to aid her on a Las Vegas road. She was a dancer at the time at the Folies Bergere. They married on Christmas Day, 1961, and had three children, Noelle, Christian, and Robert. They separated in 1969 and finally divorced 6 years later. In 1976 Longet was charged with fatally shooting her boyfriend, skier Vladimir \"Spider\" Sabich and Williams supported her. He married a second time in May 1991 to the former Debbie Haas. They make their homes at Branson, Missouri and La Quinta, California. Williams\\' homes have been featured in Architectural Digest, and he is a noted collector of modern art. Williams is an avid golfer. He hosted a major golf tournament in San Diego for many years, which was known as the Andy Williams San Diego Open during that time.\\n\\nWilliams\\' birthplace is a tourist attraction open most of the year.\\n\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Andy+Williams\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Angela Winbush (b. January 18, 1955) is an American R&B/soul singer-songwriter who rose to fame first in the 1980s R&B duo René & Angela, also scoring hits as a solo artist. During her career, Winbush has sold ten million albums and singles worldwide, and has had twenty Top Forty R&B singles and three number one R&B singles.\\n\\nEarly life and career\\n\\nBorn to a deeply religious family in St. Louis, Missouri, Angela began singing in church. She did not initially aspire to a career in music, studying architecture at Howard University, singing only to earn extra money. She continued to sing in church while at Howard as well as with gospel legend Richard Smallwood. By 1977, Angela had changed her major to music education, and recorded a demo. She shopped it to various record labels with no success but, through a personal introduction furnished by respected industry veteran, Wayne K. Garfield, the demo was heard by New York disc jockey Gary Byrd, who made the call that landed Angela a spot in Stevie Wonder\\'s backing vocal group, Wonderlove. Becoming Wonder\\'s protegé, she learned a great deal about writing and arranging songs. While in Los Angeles with Wonder, Angela met singer René Moore; the two became a couple (eventually marrying), and began writing songs together. René & Angela released their self-titled debut album in 1980, followed by Wall to Wall in 1982 and Rise in 1983. During this period they had two moderate hit singles, \"I Love You More\" and \"My First Love\".\\n\\nA Street Called Desire and meeting Ron Isley\\n\\nDuring Rene & Angela\\'s early years, they were asked to produce songs for Janet Jackson\\'s 1982 self-titled debut album, Janet Jackson. One of the songs, \"Young Love\", became Jackson\\'s first top ten R&B hit reaching number six on the chart. They also wrote exclusively for Stephanie Mills, who forged a close friendship with Winbush (their \"I Have Learned to Respect the Power of Love\", gave Mills her first-ever #1 R&B single, in 1985). Winbush would later write another Mills number one R&B hit with \"Something in the Way You Make Me Feel\". Between that, Rene & Angela decided to branch out and find a bigger fan base signing with Mercury Records in 1984. They released their breakthrough album, A Street Called Desire the following year. Among the hit singles included on the album was their first R&B number one with the dance single, \"Save Your Love (For #1)\", which included guest vocals from rapper Kurtis Blow, making it besides Chaka Khan\\'s \"I Feel For You\", one of the first songs to prominently feature a rapper. Other hit singles included \"I\\'ll Be Good\", the mostly Winbush-led \"Your Smile\" was another number one hit while the subsequent \"You Don\\'t Have to Cry\", hit number two in the beginning of 1986. Eventually A Street Called Desire sold over a million copies going platinum but on the brink of their greatest success, tensions between Winbush and Moore had grown and by the end of the album\\'s promotion, the duo split both personally and professionally. Moore would continue to find success as a songwriter, most notably for Michael Jackson, but he would never again find success as a singer as Winbush was often the main draw of their singles.\\n\\nIn 1987, Winbush was introduced to future husband Ronald Isley, lead singer of the influential Isley Brothers after Benny Medina had agreed to ask Winbush to be involved with the Isleys\\' next record when Isley proposed plans to work with Winbush on a future project. Producing, writing and arranging the Isleys\\' Smooth Sailin\\' album, Winbush helped the group, now including just Ronald and Rudolph (eldest brother O\\'Kelly had passed away the previous year), score a top 10 R&B hit with the title track.\\n\\nSharp and subsequent follow-ups\\n\\nIn turn, Isley opted to manage Winbush and he helped in the process of releasing her debut solo album, Sharp, which was also released in 1987. The album included the huge hit, \"Angel\", which stayed at number one on the R&B chart for two weeks in 1987 and showcasing her five and a half octave range. Other hits include the dance track, \"Run to Me\", \"C\\'est Toi (It\\'s You)\" and the Ron Isley duet, \"Hello Beloved\". In 1988, she wrote and produced two tracks for Sheena Easton\\'s gold album \"The Lover In Me\". They were \"Without You\" and \"Fire and Rain\", both of which showcased Easton\\'s lower range and surprisingly soulful vocals. In 1989, Winbush released her follow-up to Sharp with It\\'s the Real Thing. The title track reached number two on the R&B chart while subsequent hits \"No More Tears\" and \"Lay Your Troubles Down\" continued Winbush\\'s top 40 success on the R&B charts where she was now a fixture on despite failed attempts to cross her over to pop audiences. On June 26, 1993 Winbush and longtime manager/collaborator/lover Ronald Isley, who is thirteen years Angela\\'s senior, married. A year later Winbush released her third self-titled solo album, which included the huge R&B hit, \"Treat U Rite\". Produced by Chuckii Booker, the song peaked at number six on the R&B chart making it Winbush\\'s ninth top ten R&B hit altogether in her career. In 1996, Winbush was featured on the Isley Brothers\\' hit \"Floatin\\' On Your Love\", which was essentially a duet between Winbush and Ron Isley. The song was later remixed by Sean \"Puffy\" Combs and featured guest vocals from Lil\\' Kim and the group 112 in backgrounds. The video for it showcased Winbush serenading Isley\\'s Mr. Biggs character. Winbush continued to collaborate with the Isley Brothers until 2001\\'s Eternal, where afterwards, their marriage had cooled off. In 2002, Winbush and Isley quietly divorced. In 2003, Winbush made news when it was found out she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Eventually after a successful surgery, the cancer was in remission and Winbush returned to perform on the road.\\n\\nLegacy and influence\\n\\nSince starting out with Rene & Angela, Winbush has played an influence on various R&B and hip-hop acts. In the latter genre, Winbush has heard her music being sampled by acts such as The Notorious B.I.G. (who featured her and Jay-Z on his Rene & Angela-sampled \"I Love You More\" for the song \"I Love the Dough\"), Foxy Brown (who sampled her \"I\\'ll Be Good\" for her 1997 top ten hit, \"I\\'ll Be\") and singer Avant re-recorded the Rene & Angela ballad, \"My First Love\", with singer Keke Wyatt in 2000. In appreciation during Avant\\'s performance of the song on BET\\'s 106 & Park, in 2001, Winbush surprised the audience by singing alongside Avant on the song. As a singer, Winbush influenced the likes of Syleena Johnson and Chante Moore. Winbush and former partner Rene Moore also shared the distinction for being one of the first R&B acts to prominently feature a rap act in a R&B song sharing that distinction with Chaka Khan and funk band Cameo. Winbush also carries the distinction of being one of the few female artists to find success as a songwriter, arranger, producer and session musician (Winbush also is an avid musician playing piano and keyboards). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Angela+Winbush\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Angélica Ksyvickis Huck (born on November 30, 1973 in Santo André, São Paulo, Brazil) is a Brazilian television show host, singer and actress.\\n\\nAngélica started her carreer at 4, when she won a contest to chose Brazil\\'s most beautiful children at the popular variety show hosted by Chacrinha. At 13, she became famous when she replaced Xuxa as the host of the kids show Clube da Criança. Her popularity exploded when her hit single Vou de Taxi (remake of Joe le Taxi, by french singer Vanessa Paradis) topped the brazilian charts. Vou de Taxi became a classic song and is remember by pratically the whole brazilian population even after more than 20 years since the release of the song. She also starred on the popular mini-serie O Guarani.\\n\\nIn 1993, she signed with the second most popular channel in Brazil, SBT and started presenting the kids variety show Casa da Angelica (Angelica\\'s House), which was a big hit. Her popularity was bigger than ever and she also hosted popular teen game show Passa ou Repassa and TV Animal.\\n\\nIn 1996 she signed a milionaire contract with media-giant Globo and started hosting her own show, Angel Mix every weekday morning, which was followed by Caça Talentos (Talent Hunter), a soap opera starred by her. The ratings were huge and she became even bigger than Xuxa, being the first time any TV female host had surpassed her in popularity. Sales of her merchandising and CDs were huge.\\n\\nBut soon, after the initial boom, the ratings begin to decline and she changed the format of the show several times. While in 1996 Angélica was unbeatable among kids, in 1997 she lost popularity to Chiquititas (that year, Angélica album sold 300,000 copies against 800,000 copies by the Chiquititas cast), but she was still very popular untill 1999. In 1998, she had 250 products with her name and made more money than Xuxa in licensing (the Angelica shoes by Grendene sold over 1 million pairs in 5 months; in the same period her cereal sold over 7 million boxes and her nailpolish sold 4 million). The sucess of her products were even more remarkable because unlike Eliana (3rd on the list) and Gugu (4th), she didn\\'t promoted her product-line during her show.\\n\\nFinally, she decided to end her carreer as a child show host and, with only three monts for her contract with Globo to end, she was chose as the host for Video Game, a five minutes segment on celebrity news show Video Show. Video Game was a game-show were two celebrities would compete against each other during the whole week. The segment made the Video Show rating double and what was suppose to be a 2001 summer-only 5 minute segment became a 20 minutes block (half of the show) which is still aired and still has big ratings every afternoon.\\n\\nThe success of Video Show made Angélica popularity climb a lot again and she was soon starring in lots of advertising campaign and appearing in magazine covers. She also hosted the first two seasons of Fama, brazilian version of Operacion Triunfo.\\n\\nIn 2003 her relationship with fellow host Luciano Huck became the biggest celebrity news of the year (they had already dated before) and after their marriage, they become the country favorite couple, starring in lots of advertising campaigns. They had a son, Joaquim, in 2005.\\n\\nSince her well-received return to television hosting Video Show, Globo started to plan projects for her, but her own show finally started in April 2006. Estrelas (Stars) is a show where Angelica interview stars and show their intimacy (house, hobbies, etc). The show is the leader on it\\'s time-slot and it\\'s aired every Saturday after Caldeirão do Huck, her husband show.\\n\\nActing carreer\\n\\nAngelica had her first acting role on the succeful mini-series O Guarani at Manchete. During the late 80s and early 90s, she had roles in several Os Trapalhões movies (Os Trapalhões movies are always huge hits).\\n\\nShe returned to acting in 1998, she had a starring role in Simão, o Fantasma Trapalhão, Didi\\'s (Os Trapalhões leader) movie and starred in her own movie, Zoando na TV. Both movies were very well-received by the public.\\n\\nIn 2004, Angelica was again one of the biggest TV hosts in Brazil thanks to Video Game popularity and Globo decided to release another movie with her in the leading role but the teen-oriented movie Um Show de Verão (which she starred with real life boyfriend Luciano Huck) didn\\'t achieve the expected results, in part because it was PG-14.\\n\\nIn 1996, she starred on kids drama show Caça Talentos, which was aired daily after Angel Mix. While the show was a huge hit in the beginning, ratings soon started to decline and in 1999 it was replaced by Fada Bela, where she played a fairy. The show wasn\\'t succeful either and was replaced by Bambulua, where she played a super-hero, which again, wasn\\'t succeful.\\n\\nAt the end of 1996, at the peak of her popularity, she starred in a special and highly-promoted live special of popular sitcom Saí de Baixo and in 2001 she had a recurring role on soap opera Un Anjo Caiu do Céu, where she played an angel called Angelina.\\n\\nOn the news\\n\\nAfter going to Globo and becoming a big star, the media became obsessed about Angélica: during the late-90s, they discussed her virginity (because, at the time, she only had two boyfriends) and her relationships with Marcio Garcia, Mauricio Manieri (who his drugs problems) and Luciano Hulk.\\n\\nIn 2004, rumours about Angélica and Luciano Hulk being a couple again started and they both declined, but paparazzi pictures of both of them in Aspen surfaced and ended at Contigo! cover. Since them, their marriage, the born of their first son and their vacations were all acompanied by gossip magazines. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ang%C3%A9lica\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " '1) Angelina is Lithuanian pop singer.\\n\\n2)  Angelina is an eurodance vocalist, who recorded the hit \"The Power Of Love\".\\n\\n3) Angelina (アンジェリーナ is a bilingual Japanese-American singer-songwriter signed under Columbia Records. She can probably be known for her use of vibrato to create a unique voice. \\n\\n4) Angélina Nava is a French child singer. She placed 2nd in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2018.\\n\\n5) Angelina was the name of a somewhat mysterious British pop singer, whose real name was Jacqueline Mumford from Woodford Green, Essex). She recorded just one single that had distinct vocal hints of Dusty Springfield, the poppy, folky \\'Wishing My Life Away\\' b/w \\'I Just Don\\'t Know How\\' on Fontana in 1965.\\n\\n6) Angelina Camarillo: Long before mainstream America started “living la vida loca” with the rise of Latin pop, Upstairs Records’ recording artist Angelina was already burning up dance floors with bilingual dance tracks. As one of the leaders in the evolution of dance music, Angelina’s debut album elevated bilingual dance music to an unprecedented level. After “Release Me,” which skyrocketed to number 7 on Billboard’s Monitor, Angelina’s first album had an arsenal of hit follow up singles, including “I Don’t Need Your Love,” “Without Your Love” and “Tide is High.”  \\n\\nWith continued presence on the music industries leading charts, including Billboard’s Hot 100, Angelina was established as a proven artist in the music industry. Her songs dominated dance floors everywhere and many where so entranced by her sound that they began to refer to her as the “Latin Queen of Dance.” The buzz on Angelina reached a fevered pitch as her first album led to her tour for three consecutive years throughout the United States and Canada (as well as internationally in Brazil, South East Asia and Mexico). Angelina’s second album “Ven A Mi (Come To Me),” solidified her loyal fan base and increased her following. Two of the outstanding tracks on that album were “Every Time I Think Of You,” produced by A.B. Quintanilla (brother of the late Selena), and “Bailando,” which earned her a Latin Billboard nomination for “Best Dance Single,” in the same category as Gloria Estefan and Enrique Iglesias. Radio stations and DJ’s around the world have been anxiously awaiting something new from Angelina, and with her third album currently receiving its finishing touches, she is ready to step into the next level in the music arena. As an energetic, focused and talented performer, Angelina is sure to advance her third album to one of the year’s hottest new dance albums.\\n\\nComing from a humble family in Union City, CA, she is fiercely proud of her Latino heritage. She grew up with three brothers and one sister, and singing became her way shining. She also stood apart in her love for learning and academics, becoming the first person from both sides of her parents’ families to attend a University. In order to afford the expenses of Santa Clara University, she worked at NUMMI during the summer, a car assembly plant in which she performed such tasks as installing car batteries and welding gas tanks. It was during her sophomore year, when she was considering taking time off from her double major of Psychology and Biology because money was becoming scarce, that she attended an open audition held by Upstairs Records. They were looking for a female vocalist to record the already written song “Release Me.” Angelina’s singing career took off at a record pace. Within two weeks of being chosen she signed a record deal, recorded her smash hit single “Release Me,” and heard it on two of the largest radio stations in California, KYLD and KMEL. Though leaving school and concentrating on music would definitely have been an easier alternative, and most likely would have earned her a wider popularity, she was determined to graduate. Even with the sleepless nights spent studying, she always found time to reach out to others, volunteering at local high schools and speaking at motivational events (before her career took off she was Recruitment and Outreach Chair of M.E.Ch.A.). Beating the odds, she wanted to prove that with perseverance and determination a person with her modest background could achieve despite many people’s doubt. As a graduate of Santa Clara University, Angelina’s driving motivation in all facets of life is to be a positive role model, and she uses her passion for singing as a platform with which to inspire.\\n\\nAngelina quickly became a dance sensation internationally with her first two albums and relishes the challenge of living up to that standard with her third album. She is currently reintroducing herself to radio by being featured on hit hip-hop single “Runaway” with the NB Ridaz. The song is quickly climbing the charts as it is being played in heavy rotation all across the country. Having recently recorded the video for “Runaway,” Angelina is eager to release the first single off of her third album. Filled with up-tempo dance tracks as well as beautiful ballads, this new album is sure to continue to lift Angelina to new heights and help her at her quest at inspiring others. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Angelina\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Anggun (born Anggun Cipta Sasmi on  April 29, 1974 in Jakarta) is an Indonesian singer-songwriter.\\n\\nShe started singing in 1986. Her father, Darto Singo, was a famous singer and producer in Indonesia and Anggun decided to follow in her father\\'s footsteps. At the tender age of 7 years she recorded her first album with children\\'s song. \\n\\nAt 12, after becoming interested in rock music, she recorded her second heavily rock influenced album, \"Dunia Aku Punya\", that in the indonesian language mean \"World of mine\". This album became very popular and she became a megastar in East Asia. Having already had tremendous success in her homeland Indonesia, she decided to pursue an international career and left Indonesia in 1995, when she was only 19. \\n\\nShe settled in Paris, France and met producer Erick Benzi, who later helped her sign a record deal with Sony Music France and recorded her first French album, Au Nom de la Lune, in 1996. The album was released in 1997 and spawned a hit single, \"La neige au Sahara\". She re-recorded the album in English and it produced her biggest worldwide hit single to date, \"Snow on the Sahara.\" The album has been released in 33 countries across the world, including the US.\\n\\nTo date, Anggun has sold approximately 3 million copies of records worldwide and has become the most successful Asian artist outside Asia. Her success has spread throughout Europe, particularly in France and Italy.\\n\\nWhat if you could tell the world who you really are in 12 songs? That’s a bit what it feels like when you listen to Echoes, Anggun’s much-awaited new album.\\n\\nA lot has been written about the Indonesian singer. Some people have mentioned a fairytale to explain the rise of a young music-loving girl who became a superstar in the country of her birth before striking out to conquer France and Europe when she was only about 20. Following a stream of hits in French, English and Indonesian (and her massive international hit Snow On The Sahara), she has now sold over 2 million records in just a few years. Her albums have been released in 35 countries and she has made the Top 5 in the European charts and the Top 20 of the US Billboard charts. Add to this a wide-ranging list of prizes and honours including a World Music Awards performance, giving the Christmas concert at the Vatican in the presence of Pope John Paul II, an interview with CNN in New York and her extremely prestigious nomination as a Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres in France. Quite simply, Anggun is the Asian artist who has sold the most records outside Asia, without doubt one of the most famous Asian stars internationally.\\n\\nPeople have also often listed the duets the woman has been involved in. Her eclectic musical tastes make her feel just as comfortable singing with Peter Gabriel, Michael Bolton, Julio Iglesias, Bryan Adams and Zucchero as with DJ Cam, Laurent Wolf and Pras from The Fugees. Her eclectic taste in movies have seen her perform the theme tune for American blockbusters (The #1 US box office movie The Transporter II) ; arthouse films (Open Hearts directed by Academy Awards winner Susanne Bier) and even the soundtrack to the latest feature film by legendary French director Claude Lelouch (Ces Amours-là).\\n\\nWith each passing year and album, she has kept surprising us and kept reinventing herself through new artistic projects and her own personal development. Echoes, in a sense, sums up this transformation, returning to the pop sound that made her name, but this time with new collaborators. The origins of this album are to be found in the coming together of two teams familiar with success: Gioacchino and Pierre Jaconelli on the one hand, and the duo of Jean-Pierre Pilot and William Rousseau on the other. Anggun has been involved in every step of the making of Echoes. She has written the lyrics of every song, making this album probably her most personal to date.\\n\\n“I love her timbre. I’d been wanting to work with her for a while,” explains Giacchino, who has already collaborated with the biggest French stars, and who is currently working on Celine Dion’s upcoming new album. “I found in her the very same depth of personality that I liked about her voice.” This profoundness is felt in the Irish-influenced smash hit single Only Love, which deals with the quest for true and unconditional love. A Stranger timidly speaks of the loneliness and fear of the unknown that were often a feature of the singer’s constant moving around. Whereas a few years ago Anggun still sang of exile as a painful experience, now she knows where she is headed, as she has accepted that her destiny will always be bound up with travelling. Year of the Snake is a restrained song that gives the thoughts of a woman remembering painful momentsof her life. And yet, without any excess exoticism or pointless clichés, you find subtle traces of the singer’s Indonesian roots via the various subjects she tackles. Eternal talks of accepting the death of a loved one, without seeking to squeeze a tear out of the listener at any cost. On the other hand, the extremely sensual Rollercoaster, composed by Axel Bauer, conjures up the passion and sense of drama that can be part of the singer’s life aswell.\\n\\nJean-Pierre Pilot and William Rousseau were coming off the back of major successes in France when they met Anggun. “What surprised us was the contrast between the simple, fun-loving woman we had in front of us and the image of the superstar diva we know from her videos or live performances. The two personalities coexist inside her in perfect harmony,” William Rousseau explains. “As a result, we were keen to explore her more private side without going off into completely pared-down musical style.” Many women will identify with the themes of the album: an upbeat girl’s power message in Weapons, the weariness of My Addiction or the acceptance of who we really are in Impossible. Anggun reveals herself to be both mischievous and totally fulfilled. Yet the power of the melodies does not supplant the emotion, as illustrated by the bittersweet Buy me happiness and the discreet Silent vow.\\n\\nAnggun is offering exclusive bonus tracks in this new album: Count on me, Sorry and the hypnotic song Always You produced by German electro-pop superstar Schiller, taken from the artist’s latest album which has reached the #1 spot in the German Album Charts and went Gold a few weeks after its release.\\n\\nSometimes fatale, sometimes disappointed, often amorous and always strong, Anggun sings about the woman she was and above all about the woman she is today. Neither completely the same nor completely someone else, with Echoes she gives us her most personal and paradoxically most universal album: the Echoes of an artist who is no longer torn between two cultures – her heartland of Indonesia and her adoptive country France; she has managed to find an equilibrium between these two worlds and to make the very best of them.\\n\\nDiscography\\n\\n Indonesian-language albums:\\n    * 1986: Dunia Aku Punya\\n    * 1990: Mimpi\\n    * 1990: Tua Tua Keladi\\n    * 1990: Takut\\n    * 1991: Anak Putih Abu Abu\\n    * 1992: Nocturno\\n    * 1993: Anggun C.

       " 'Angela \"Angie\" Martinez (born January 9, 1971, Brooklyn, New York) is an American radio personality, former rapper, and actress. Known as “The Voice of New York”, her afternoon radio show has consistently been ranked #1 with more young listeners than any other radio program in the country.\\n\\nAngie Martinez got her first break in radio at the age of 16 answering hot lines at the urban radio station WQHT (\"Hot 97\"). There she met popular DJ Funkmaster Flex, and began working as his protégé. Martinez quickly picked up on the craft of running a successful radio program. Executives at the station decided to give her a chance, even though she lacked on-air experience.\\n\\nAs an actress, Angie received small roles in independent hip hop films such as Blood is Thicker Than Water and Paper Soldiers. She then appeared in Brown Sugar starring Taye Diggs, Queen Latifah and Sanaa Lathan.\\n\\nIn 1996, Martinez was encouraged to give rapping a shot by friend KRS-One. She appeared on his track \"Heartbeat\" from his 1997 album I Got Next. After the song gained a strong fan following, another friend, Lil\\' Kim, offered her a spot on the \"Ladies Night Remix\" of her song \"Not Tonight\" for the Nothing to Lose soundtrack. Along with Missy Elliott, Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes and Da Brat, the ladies enjoyed one of the most successful singles of 1997. It peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at #2, and reached #1 on the Hip-Hop / R&B charts and the Rap charts respectively. The single sold over 1,000,000 copies and was certified Platinum. The ladies were nominated for two Grammy Awards that year, and were also invited to perform the song live on The MTV Video Music Awards. A major label battle began to sign Martinez to a recording contract. Her appearance on other rapper\\'s material was in high demand. She recorded songs with Mary J. Blige (\"Christmas in the City\"), Terror Squad (\"Freak Out\"), N.O.R.E. (\"Oh No Remix\"), Beenie Man (\"Tell Me Remix\") and Funkmaster Flex & Big Kap\\'s compilation album The Tunnel (\"Wow\"). She also recorded interludes for mixtapes by Kid Capri, DJ Clue and DJ Kayslay. In 2001, she appeared in the music video for Jay-Z and R. Kelly\\'s \"Guilty Until Proven Innocent\".\\n\\nOn April 17, 2001, she finally issued her oft-delayed debut album, Up Close and Personal. The album included production by DJ Clue, Salaam Remi, Knobody and RocWilder among others, and featured guest appearances by Jay-Z, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Mary J. Blige, Wyclef Jean, Busta Rhymes and Kool G. Rap. The first single, \"Dem Thangzzz\" was produced by The Neptunes, and also featured background vocals by Pharrell Williams and Q-Tip. The track failed to make a strong impression at radio, but the album enjoyed strong first week sales. It debuted at #32 on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart, and #10 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Charts selling 69,000 its first week. The second single, \"Coast 2 Coast\" (Suavamente) featuring rapper Wyclef Jean re-sparked interest in the album. She promoted the album with magazine posters, in-store signings, club appearances and television appearances with MTV and BET. The record received mixed reviews from critics, but like Martinez herself, was strongly accepted in the hip hop community. The album sold a low 325,000 units.\\n\\nFollowing her first album\\'s release, Angie began work on a second record Animal House. In order to build anticipation for the record, she appeared on BET\\'s Rap City and began a nation-wide radio tour. She recorded a verse for the remix to her Artist Sacario record \"Live Big\". It became the number one record in the tri-state area and coincidentally coincided with the release of Martinez\\'s first single from her second album, \"If I Could Go\" which also featured Sacario and singer Lil\\' Mo. \"If I Could Go\" became a huge crossover hit on pop radio, climbing into the top 10 on The Billboard Hot 100 Chart. It became the #1 played on urban radio in 2002. The album, Animal House (named after Martinez\\'s own production company and recording posse), was released on August 21, 2002. It entered the Billboard Hot 200 Albums Chart at #11, and the Billboard Hot Hip-Hop / R&B Charts selling 92,000 units in its first week. The follow-up single, \"Take You Home\" featuring R&B singer Kelis didn\\'t receive as much attention, but it did become a minor hit that winter. The album was more strongly received by critics and fans. Following the release of the album, she was featured on a remix for labelmate Lil\\' Mo\\'s track \"Gangster\", and Nina Sky\\'s hype single \"Time to Go\". Following this she announced she was retiring from the recording industry to concentrate on her other projects.\\n\\nShe has a son Niko Ruffin (born June 12, 2003) with Tamir \"Nokio\" Ruffin of Dru Hill. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Angie+Martinez\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Anita Baker (born January 26, 1958, in Toledo, Ohio) is a soul and adult contemporary Rhythm and blues singer.\\n\\nWith her classy, refined brand of romantic soul, Anita Baker was one of the definitive quiet storm singers of the \\'80s. Gifted with a strong, supple alto, Baker was influenced not only by R&B, but jazz, gospel, and traditional pop, which gave her music a distinctly adult sophistication. Smooth and mellow, but hardly lifeless, it made her one of the most popular romantic singers of her time.\\n\\nBaker was born January 26, 1958, in Toledo, OH, and raised in nearby Detroit, where she grew up listening to female jazz singers like Sarah Vaughan, Nancy Wilson, and Ella Fitzgerald. At age 12, she began singing a gospel choir, and by age 16 she was performing with several local bands. In 1975, she successfully auditioned for Chapter 8, one of Detroit\\'s most popular acts at the time; the group eventually signed with Ariola and released an album in 1979, but were immediately dropped when the label was acquired by Arista (which didn\\'t care for Baker\\'s vocals). Chastened, Baker worked low-paying jobs in Detroit and eventually found steady work as a receptionist at a law firm. In 1982, Otis Smith -- an executive who\\'d worked with Chapter 8 -- contacted Baker about recording for his new label Beverly Glen. Happy with her employment benefits and skittish over the experience with Arista, Baker was reluctant at first, but eventually flew out to the West Coast to record her debut album, The Songstress, in 1983. Though it didn\\'t gain quite enough exposure to become a hit, it did help Baker build a strong fan base through word-of-mouth and she was signed by Elektra in 1985.\\n\\nWorking with producer Michael J. Powell (an old Chapter 8 cohort), Baker released her major-label debut Rapture in 1986. It was a platinum, Grammy winning smash, appealing to both urban and adult contemporary listeners and producing two all-time quiet storm classics in \"Caught Up in the Rapture\" and \"Sweet Love.\" Baker toured the world in 1987 and her guest appearance on the Winans track \"Ain\\'t No Need to Worry\" won a Grammy. Her equally stylish follow-up album, Giving You the Best That I Got, appeared in 1988, spawning more staples in the title track and \"Just Because.\" \"Giving You the Best That I Got\" also won Baker two more Grammys, for Best Female R&B Vocal and Best R&B Song. For her third Elektra album, Baker decided to handle a greater share of the songwriting, hence the title Compositions, which was released in 1990 and featured even stronger jazz inflections than Baker\\'s previous work (not to mention all live instruments).\\n\\nFollowing Compositions, Baker took a break from recording and touring; after having her first son in 1993, she returned to the studio to craft Rhythm of Love, which was released in 1994. In the years that followed, Baker was mostly silent, despite her fans\\' clamoring for a jazz album; instead, she raised her family and became embroiled in contract disputes with Elektra, which eventually led her to move to Atlantic. She began working on a new album in 2000, but had to start over from scratch due to defective recording equipment that made the original tracks unsalvageable. In 2004 it was announced that she had signed with Blue Note and still working on her new album. In the meantime, the Atlantic imprint Rhino released Night of Rapture: Live, a 1987 concert originally available on video. Baker finally returned to the studio in 2003 and issued My Everything, her first album in 10 years. Two years later she released her first holiday album, Christmas Fantasy. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Anita+Baker\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Steve Wariner (born Steven Noel Wariner, December 25, 1954, Noblesville, Indiana) is an American country music singer, guitarist and songwriter. He was one of the most popular artists during the 1980s, thanks to a string of No. 1 singles recorded for both RCA and MCA Records. After his popularity waned somewhat during the mid-1990s, he enjoyed a resurgence thanks to his 1998 hit \"Holes in the Floor of Heaven.\"\\n\\n\\n[edit] Career\\nWariner began performing as a youth in his father\\'s band and in local clubs. In 1971, he was hired as a bassist for Dottie West\\'s band. He also worked heavily with Chet Atkins (one of his childhood influences) and he played with Bob Luman\\'s band.\\n\\nHis first major recording contract was with RCA Records in 1978. His first single releases failed to chart in the top 40 of Billboard magazine\\'s Hot Country Singles chart, although the song \"I\\'m Already Taken\" was re-released in 1999, peaking at #3 that year. His first No. 1 hit came in December, 1981, with \"All Roads Lead to You.\"\\n\\nHowever, his real popularity didn\\'t take off until the mid-1980s, when he began recording for MCA Records. During his six-year stint with MCA, he scored 19 consecutive top 10 hits, eight of them going to No. 1 on Billboard magazine\\'s Hot Country Singles chart. The most successful of those songs included \"Some Fools Never Learn\" (1985, his second No. 1 hit), \"What I Didn\\'t Do\" (1985), \"You Can Dream of Me\" (1986), \"Lynda\" (1987) and \"I Got Dreams\" (1989).\\n\\nIn the early 1990s, Wariner continued his success with Arista Records, with several of his songs reaching the top 10. But his success soon tapered off, as radio programmers became more interested in newer performers.\\n\\nWariner, however, continued to maintain his popularity through his instrumental talents. One example was 1991\\'s \"Restless,\" a collaboration with Ricky Skaggs, Vince Gill and Mark O\\'Connor (from O\\'Connor\\'s album The New Nashville Cats). \"Restless\" won Wariner (as well as Skaggs and Gill) his first Grammy Award in 1991 for Best Country Vocal Collaboration. In 1996, Wariner released an album of all instrumental tracks called No More Mr. Nice Guy. Though well-received by critics, it proved to be Wariner\\'s last album for Arista.\\n\\nWariner also remained in the public eye with his songwriting talents. His composition, \"Longneck Bottle\" (a No. 1 hit by Garth Brooks), along with a No. 1 duet from early 1998 with singer Anita Cochran called \"What If I Said\" (his first No. 1 in more than eight years) reinvigorated Wariner\\'s career.\\n\\nThe highlight of Wariner\\'s career came in the spring of 1998. Now recording for Capitol Records, his song \"Holes in the Floor of Heaven\" - a song about dealing with grief of close friends and relatives - promptly shot to No. 2 and won the Country Music Association awards for Single of the Year and Song of the Year.\\n\\nWariner also collaborated with other well-known singers and songwriters, including Clint Black and Bill Anderson; he also scored several more hits, most notably 1999\\'s \"Two Teardrops\" and \"I\\'m Already Taken\" (the latter a re-recording of his 1978 debut release).\\n\\n\\n[edit] Discography\\nMain article: Steve Wariner discography\\n\\n[edit] External links\\nThe Official Fan Club Website \\nGrand Ole Opry Bio \\nRetrieved from \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wariner\"\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Wariner\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Anita Ward (born 20 December 1956 in Memphis, Tennessee, USA) is an American Disco and R&B singer.\\n\\nBefore signing a recording contract, Ward obtained a degree in psychology from Rust College in Holly Springs, Mississippi, and had become a schoolteacher. While recording her first album (on Juana records) Frederick Knight, who owned the label, presented her with a song he had written the previous year for singer Stacy Lattisaw. Ward did not like the song, but Knight insisted that a dance track was needed to capitalize on the current disco trend, and Ward relented. The song, which was originally a juvenile-targeted tune about teens talking on the telephone, was rewritten with more \"adult\" lyrics, and the result was the single \"Ring My Bell\" which reached number one in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom in 1979. Disputes with Knight, a car accident, and the fading appeal of disco music halted Ward\\'s career and she came to be regarded as a one hit wonder. Only one other single of hers made the Billboard charts in the U.S., \"Don\\'t Drop My Love,\" which halted at #87.\\n\\nOn New Year\\'s Eve 2002 she performed \"Ring My Bell\" in New York City\\'s Times Square before a crowd of revelers as part of the city\\'s official celebration. On New Years\\'s Eve 2005, Anita performed in Memphis, Tennessee at Backstreet. She sang her number one classic hit \"Ring My Bell\" and several other disco hits.\\n\\nShe has also appeared in Zagreb, Croatia on 4 January 2006, the night before the FIS World Cup slalom race on nearby Sljeme with some other groups and singers from disco era (Nile Rodgers & Chic, Village People, Thelma Houston and Rose Royce).\\n\\nSinger Anita Ward is most well-known for her 1979 disco single \"Ring My Bell,\" a number one pop hit in the U.S. and the U.K. Born on December 20, 1957 in Memphis, Tennessee, Ward developed an interest in music -- particularly gospel -- at an early age. She went on to sing with the Rust College A Cappella Choir (which included recording alongside renowned Metropolitan Opera vocalist Leontyne Price), and recorded an obscure album with her own gospel quartet. After graduation, however, Ward didn\\'t set out to pursue a career in music and instead became a substitute teacher in the Memphis elementary school system. It wasn\\'t long before Ward realized music was too much a part of her life to ignore, and her manager put her in contact with singer/songwriter Frederick Knight (who had scored a substantial hit in the summer of 1972 with \"I\\'ve Been Lonely for So Long\"). Knight signed on to help produce a three-song demo session with Ward, but once the tape was rolling, Knight became so taken by Ward\\'s singing ability that the sessions soon produced an album\\'s worth of material. \\n\\n After listening to what they\\'d recorded, both agreed that they were still one song short, which resulted in Knight digging up an old track titled \"Ring My Bell,\" which he had originally penned for a younger singer, Stacy Lattisaw (who would later score several hits in the early \\'80s). The song\\'s original lyrics dealt with teens chatting away on the phone and even though Knight gave the track a quick lyrical overhaul, Ward was less than enthusiastic about the song. Still, she agreed to record it, with Knight providing most of the musical accompaniment. Recorded over the course of two days, \"Ring My Bell\" turned out to be the best track of the bunch. It resulted in a recording contract with the T.K.-affiliated Juana label, and the release of Ward\\'s debut album, Songs of Love, in 1979. It didn\\'t take long for \"Ring My Bell\" to scale the charts. That summer, it topped Billboard\\'s Hot 100 and remained on that chart for five months. A subsequent single, \"Don\\'t Drop My Love\" -- taken from the quick-to-follow second album Sweet Surrender -- peaked at only number 87. A few songs were recorded during sessions for a third album abandoned prior to completion. They surfaced on various Ward anthologies released during the following decades. Although Ward rarely recorded -- she released a single in 2011 -- she continued to perform into the 2010s. ~ Greg Prato, Rovi\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Anita+Ward\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Peebles soon began writing and singing hits for the label, cowriting with label staff songwriter Don Bryant, whom she married in 1974. Peebles released a number of commercially successful and critically well received albums produced by Willie Mitchell on Hi Records throughout the 1970s, until the rise of disco in the late 1970s took her music out of the limelight.

       " 'Ann-Margret (born April 28, 1941) is a Swedish actress and singer who was born Ann-Margret Olsson in Valsjöbyn, Jämtland, Sweden. She moved to the United States when she was young and grew up in Wilmette, Illinois. She attended Northwestern University and was discovered singing in a nightclub by George Burns. She was often referred to as a \"sex-kitten\" and the \"female Elvis\".\\n\\nAnn-Margret started recording for RCA in 1961, but her recording career was not as successful as her concurrent movie career. She had a sexy, throaty singing voice comparable to Eartha Kitt or Nancy Sinatra, and RCA attempted to capitalize on her \"Female Elvis\" comparison by her recording a version of Presley\\'s \"Heartbreak Hotel\" and other songs stylistically similar to Presley. She scored one minor hit, \"I Just Don\\'t Understand\" (which entered the Billboard Top 40 in the third week of August 1961 and stayed 6 weeks, peaking at #17.) Her only charting album is The Beauty and the Beard (1964), on which she was accompanied by trumpeter Al Hirt. The contract with RCA ended in 1966.\\n \\nYears later, she returned to music at the end of Disco era. Her 1980 album, \"Ann-Margret\" became a success with both singles, \"Midnight Message\" and \"Love Rush\" reaching the Top 10 of the Hot Dance Club Songs chart. In the early 1980s, the album was followed up with the single, \"Everybody Needs Somebody Sometimes\" and the B-Side \"Hold Me/Squeeze Me.\" Ann Margret has continued to record music sporatically since then. \\n[edit]Film career\\n\\nIn 1961 she also made her film début for in Pocketful of Miracles, starring Bette Davis, Glenn Ford, and Hope Lange, a remake of the Oscar-winning 1933 film Lady for a Day; both versions were directed by the great Frank Capra. She followed that role with the successful remake of Rodgers\\' and Hammerstein\\'s musical State Fair in 1962. Her next starring role, as the all-American teenager in Bye Bye Birdie, made her a major star. When she filmed Viva Las Vegas with Elvis Presley the two began an affair that received considerable attention from the gossip columnists in various media. The reports led to a showdown with a very worried Priscilla Beaulieu, which she recounts in her 1985 book, Elvis and Me, including Ann-Margret\\'s attempt to \"cut her off at the pass\" with a press announcement that Ann-Margret and Elvis were engaged to be married. Although he ended the affair, Presley remained a friend and continued to send her flowers at the opening of each of her stage appearances until he died. Of all the Hollywood starlets he had worked with or had a relationship with, Ann-Margret was the only one to attend his funeral.\\nIn 1963, Ann-Margret was featured and guest-starred, in animated form, in an episode of Hanna-Barbera\\'s The Flintstones as \"Ann-Margrock.\" Decades later, she recorded the theme song to the live-action film The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas in character as Ann-Margrock. The song she recorded was a modified version of the \"Viva Las Vegas\" theme.\\\\\\n\\nIn March 1966, Ann-Margret and entertainers Chuck Day and Mickey Jones teamed up for a USO tour to entertain U.S. servicemen in remote parts of Vietnam and other parts of Southeast Asia. She still has great affection for the veterans and refers to them as \"my gentlemen\". [1] Ann-Margret, Day and Jones reunited for an encore of this tour for veterans and troops at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada in November 2005. [2]\\n\\nIn 1971, she starred in Mike Nichols\\'s Carnal Knowledge, marking a change from her sex-kitten musical roles, garnering a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. The following year, while performing at Lake Tahoe, Nevada, she fell 22 feet from the stage and suffered injuries that put her out of commission for several months. Throughout the 1970s, Ann-Margret balanced her live performances with a string of critically acclaimed dramatic film performances that played against her glamorous image, including Tommy in 1975, for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. In addition, she has been nominated for ten Golden Globe Awards, winning five times including Best Actress for Tommy. She also did a string of successful TV specials, starting with The Ann-Margret Show for NBC in 1968. Now in her mid-60s, she continues to act in movies.\\n\\nIn 1994, she published an autobiography titled Ann Margret: My Story (ISBN 0-399-13891-9).

       " 'Bobby Byrd (Robert Howard Byrd,  Toccoa, Georgia, August 15, 1934 – Loganville, Georgia, September 12, 2007) was an american funk, soul, rhythm & blues, gospel singer, songwriter and record producer.\\n\\nBobby Byrd was raised in the relative security of a church going family in Toccoa, Georgia. His family were respected members of their congregation and active in supporting their community. \\nHe was active in his local church\\'s gospel choir, The Zioneers and then made a local name for himself in the Gospel Starlighters. It was a time when Church elders disapproved of secular singing so Byrd and the other members of the Gospel Starlighters would leave the state to perform secular material as The Avons. Byrd provided vocals, piano and organ and led a group including: Sylvester Keels, Fred Pulliam, Doyle Onglesby, Nashpendle \"Nash\" Knox and Nafloyd Scott on guitar.\\n\\nJames Brown and The Famous Flames\\nIn 1952 Bobby Byrd was playing baseball against the inmates of the Alto Reformatory prison team and met the music mad James Brown apparently showing off his singing to other inmates. Byrd befriended him and arranged for Byrd\\'s family to oversee Brown\\'s parole.\\n\\nIt began a personal and professional association that lasted until 1973 and although Byrd had twenty years plus as a solo performer it is his association with Brown for which he is chiefly remembered. Brown was a remarkable tour de force of vitality and personality and within a short time he had not only joined the Avons but he was directing affairs changing their name to The Flames. Byrd recognised early that Brown was unique and that it would be impossible to control him: \\n\\'I didn\\'t need him in competition, I needed him with me, that\\'s why I worked so hard to get him over to my group\\'\\n\\nThe group, with the addition of Johnny Terry and Baroy Scott on bass, moved to Macon, Georgia and signed with the King subsidiary label, Federal. Their first record Please, Please, Please appeared in February 1956 as by James Brown and the Flames, a fact that did not please some members of the band and after just three sessions the original Flames had split. At the final session Byrd and Brown wrote the rhythm & blues dancer \\'Can\\'t be the same\\' the first of many co-colloborations with Brown many of which Byrd failed to gain credit.\\n\\nThe Flames without Brown changed their name to Byrd\\'s Drops of Joy but found the going tough so that when Brown approached them to reform the Flames they agreed. The power within the group was now with James Brown. At this point, The Famous Flames ceased being a vocal/instrumental group, and became a straight vocal group, as there was no need for additional instrumentalists, since Brown, in the interim, had already began to employ his own road band, the old J.C. Davis outfit, which became the first incarnation of the new James Brown Band (now a separate entity from The Flames,who were now all vocalists save for Byrd, who sang and occasionally also doubled on keyboards). Original Flames members Bobby Byrd and Johnny Terry returned, and new Flames members Bobby Bennett and Lloyd Stallworth were added. Original Flames guitarist Nafloyd Scott also returned, and was added to the band.This was in 1958.\\n\\nByrd also recorded many solo funk tracks, most famously \"I Know You Got Soul\" (1971), which have been sampled by musicians including Public Enemy, Eric B. & Rakim, Ice Cube, LL Cool J and A Tribe Called Quest.\\nHe was the original leader and founder of The Famous Flames, the vocal group with which James Brown first became famous. Byrd is actually the man who discovered James Brown.\\n\\nByrd and Brown met in a Georgia youth detention facility, where Brown was an inmate. Byrd\\'s local baseball team played the prison team of which Brown was a member. It was Bobby Byrd\\'s family that sponsored his release and took him in afterwards.\\n\\nByrd was leader and founder of a vocal group called The Avons when Brown joined in the mid 1950s. The Avons later became The Flames, then The Famous Flames, before they were repackaged with Brown as the frontman. James Brown and the Famous Flames, with Byrd as a member, recorded many hit singles, including \"Please, Please, Please\",\"Try Me\", \"Think\", \"Bewildered\", \"Oh Baby, Don\\'t You Weep\", \"I Don\\'t Mind\",\"Shout and Shimmy\" , \" I\\'ll Go Crazy\", and many more.\\n\\nBrown and The Flames were also known for their powerful on stage performances across the United States in venues such as the Apollo Theatre in New York, (where they recorded the million-selling Live At The Apollo album) the Regal in Chicago, and The Royal Theatre in Baltimore (where they recorded the 1964 Top 10 live album, Pure Dynamite! Live at the Royal) and on film in the 1964 concert film, The T.A.M.I. Show, where they upstaged The Rolling Stones. Byrd also appeared with Brown and the group in the film Ski Party (1965), Dick Clark\\'s American Bandstand, and twice on The Ed Sullivan Show. Byrd was the only member of The Flames to remain with Brown when the group disbanded in 1968.\\n\\nIn 1993 Byrd released a solo album On the Move on the German record Label, Soulciety Records.\\n\\nIn October 2004 Bobby Byrd\\'s songs \"I Know You Got Soul\" and \"Hot Pants\" were featured on the Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas soundtrack, playing on fictional radio station Master Sounds 98.3. In September 2005 his song \"Try It Again\" appeared on the soundtrack of Indigo Prophecy.\\n\\nHe was married, for many years until his death, to soul singer Vicki Anderson, another James Brown collaborator. His stepdaughter is Carleen Anderson. On September 12, 2007, surrounded by his family, Byrd died of cancer, aged 73 in Loganville, Georgia.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a long-running right-hand man, Bobby Byrd performed an invaluable function in the James Brown Show, warming up the crowds as a solo singer, then retreating to the sidelines as a member of the Famous Flames, Brown\\'s backup vocal group. Indeed, without Byrd, James Brown may have never made it out of Georgia: in the early \\'50s, Byrd and his family sponsored Brown\\'s parole from prison, and Byrd gave Brown a spot in his vocal group, the Flames (which, of course, Brown eventually took over and relegated to the background). Like many of Brown\\'s close associates and support musicians, Byrd got a chance to record his own records under Brown\\'s direction, releasing numerous Brown-produced singles between the early \\'60s and early \\'70s. Some of these were even modest R&B hits — \"We\\'re in Love\" (1965) and \"I Need Help (I Can\\'t Do It Alone)\" (1970) were the biggest, making the R&B Top 20. Brown\\'s backing musicians (and sometimes Brown himself) often figured heavily in the arrangements, and unsurprisingly the tracks often sounded like James Brown records featuring a different vocalist. The unfortunate problem was that Byrd was an average, even nondescript soul singer, sounding much more like a poor person\\'s Sam & Dave than a facsimile of Soul Brother Number One. The records were often fine, the early \\'70s hard funk singles in particular (which usually featured the JB\\'s cook), but you can\\'t help wondering if they might sound a lot better with J.B. himself on the front line. Still, fans of the James Brown groove will find a lot to like in Byrd\\'s best recordings, in much the same way as they\\'ll enjoy the James Brown\\'s Funky People series of recordings that J.B. oversaw (but did not sing lead on). Certainly Eric B. & Rakim thought so, reworking one of Byrd\\'s best singles (1971\\'s \"I Know You Got Soul\") so faithfully that legal action ensued. After splitting from Brown in 1973, Byrd recorded sporadically and performed often (particularly in Europe), releasing On the Move in 1994. Actually On the Move was released by TK records in Miami Florida earliier than 1994 with Byrds band the Brass Byrd Band a group from Saginaw Michigan but only two remained with the group from Saginaw at this time Arthur Dixion and Sax player and brother Errol (Earl the Pearl Lovechild) Caviness.

       " 'Anne Jacqueline Hathaway is an actress and singer.\\n\\nAnne Jacqueline Hathaway\\'s first major role came in the short-lived television series \"Get Real\" (1999). She gained widespread recognition for her roles in The Princess Diaries (2001) and its 2004 sequel as a young girl who discovers she\\'s a member of royalty, opposite Julie Andrews and Heather Matarazzo.\\n\\nShe also had a notable role in Nicholas Nickleby (2002) opposite Charlie Hunnam and Jamie Bell, and a starring role in Ella Enchanted (2004). A former top-ranking soprano in New York, Hathaway was reportedly a front-runner for the role of \"Christine\" in the 2004 The Phantom of the Opera (2004). However, due to scheduling conflicts with The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004), she couldn\\'t take the role, which was later given to newcomer Emmy Rossum.\\n\\nHathaway soon started to move away from family-friendly films. Following The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004), she appeared topless in the films Havoc (2005) opposite Josh Peck and Brokeback Mountain (2005) opposite Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Her desire to break out of her \"Princess Diaries\" image parallels that of her one-time co-star, Julie Andrews, who went topless in the film S.O.B. (1981) in order to break away from the image she created from her 1960s musicals. In interviews, Hathaway said that doing family-friendly films didn\\'t mean she was similar to their characters or mean she objected to appearing nude in other films.\\n\\nOther films she has starred in include The Devil Wears Prada (2006) opposite Meryl Streep, Becoming Jane (2007), in which she plays a young Jane Austen, and Rachel Getting Married (2008) in which she plays Rachel\\'s sister who comes home for her sister\\'s wedding after rehab.\\n\\nHathaway was born in Brooklyn, New York, U.S. Her father, Gerald Thomas Hathaway, is a lawyer, and her mother, Kathleen Ann (née McCauley), is an actress who inspired Hathaway to follow in her footsteps. The family moved to Millburn, New Jersey, when she was six years old. Hathaway has an older brother, Michael, and a younger brother, Thomas. She is of mostly Irish and French ancestry, with distant Native American and German roots. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Anne+Hathaway\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Music icon Anne Murray has sold more than 50 million albums in a distinguished career that spans four decades.  On January 15th, Manhattan/EMI will release Anne Murray Duets: Friends & Legends, an exceptional 17-track collection of her top hits and favorites, newly recorded as duets with some of the world’s top female recording artists. \\n\\nAnne Murray Duets: Friends & Legends showcases a wide variety of Anne\\'s favorite female vocalists.  Among the album’s tracks and collaborating artists are \"Snowbird\" with Sarah Brightman, \"You Needed Me\" with Shania Twain, \"Nobody Loves Me Like You Do\" with Anne’s daughter Dawn Langstroth, \"Danny\\'s Song\" with Martina McBride, “Another Pot O’ Tea” with Emmylou Harris, “A Little Good News” with Indigo Girls, “Cotton Jenny\" with Olivia Newton-John, “Could I Have This Dance” with Amy Grant, “Daydream Believer” with Nelly Furtado, “A Love Song” with k.d. lang, “Time Don’t Run Out On Me” with the song’s writer, Carole King, and more.\\n\\nIn 1979, Anne and Dusty Springfield each recorded the song \"I Just Fall In Love Again.\" Anne\\'s version became a hit single that garnered her Canada’s Juno Award for \"Single of the Year\" in 1980. Anne and Dusty remained friends until Dusty’s passing in 1999, and for Anne, releasing an album with this type of sisterly theme wouldn\\'t seem complete without Dusty\\'s inclusion.  With the blessing of the Springfield family and estate, a new version pairing Dusty\\'s original with Anne’s newly recorded vocals is featured on the album. \\n\\nAnne Murray Duets: Friends & Legends was produced by one of the most respected music producers in the world, Phil Ramone (Tony Bennett, Bob Dylan, Elton John, Barbra Streisand, Billy Joel), who counts 14 Grammy Awards and 32 Grammy nominations among his many honors.  Together, Anne and Phil decided they would treat the songs on their own terms and not adhere rigidly to the arrangements of Anne’s classic versions. While Anne had designs on how she imagined the arrangements, she gave Phil free rein to rework the songs. \\n“We approached the sessions as if we were just handed these songs and told to make this record,” explains Ramone. “While arrangements were changed, there are also licks on some songs that I didn’t mess with. We stayed true to the song.”\\nWorking with Anne for the first time, Ramone adds, was an easy task.  “What I love about Anne is there are no words minced about whatever she feels,” he says. “This is not a person you have to think, ‘Will she tell me the truth?’ When we met for a few hours in Michigan before we started, we agreed we wanted to bring some daring ideas and some freshness to this album.”\\n“I said to Phil,” joked Anne, “The only reason I asked you was that I’m the only singer left that you haven’t worked with!”\\n“I’ve done duets throughout my career,” Anne says. “I did duets when I started out on (CBC Television’s) ‘Singalong Jubilee.’ I did a duets album in 1971 with Glen Campbell. Growing up I did lot of group singing at school and sang with my brothers.  I’ve always loved singing harmony.”\\nSince releasing her debut album in 1967, Anne Murray has been honored with a spectacular number of awards. She is the proud recipient of four Grammy Awards, three American Music Awards, three Country Music Association Awards, three Canadian Country Music Association Awards and twenty-four Juno Awards. Anne has also been honored with the Legacy Award from the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame (2006), the East Coast Music Association Directors\\' Special Achievement Award (2001), induction into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame (2002), and induction into the Juno Hall of Fame (1993).\\n\\nAnne Murray will tour to several U.S. cities in February and March 2008 (confirmed tour dates listed below). For updates and additional information, visit Anne Murray’s official Website: www.annemurray.com\\nIn 2011, Billboard ranked her 10th on their list of the 50 Biggest Adult Contemporary Artists Ever, and on July 1, 2017, in celebration of Canada’s 150th Anniversary, the Toronto Sun listed Anne at #1 in Canada’s Top 160 Influences that helped define Canadian culture! <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Anne+Murray\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Later in life, in a would-be comeback, she recorded two demo records, but they were never released.\\n\\nBirthdate\\nFor many years it was believed that Annette had been born in 1910 and began her recording career shortly before her 16th birthday. However, it has recently come to light that she was in fact born nine years earlier, making her 24 at the time of her first commercial recording in September 1926. Her nephew, Frank W.

       " 'Aretha Franklin (March 25, 1942 - August 16, 2018) was a Memphis, Tennessee born and Detroit, Michigan reared American iconic gospel, soul, and R&B singer, songwriter and pianist. Many have called her \"The Queen Of Soul\" and \"Lady Soul\".\\n\\nShe is renowned for her soul and R&B recordings (on many, of which, she accompanied herself on keyboards and piano, a skill she learned at an early age, learning to play by ear, according to lifetime friend Smokey Robinson) but was also adept at jazz, rock, blues, pop, and gospel.\\n\\nShe is generally regarded as one of the best vocalists ever by such industry publications and media outlets as Rolling Stone and VH1, due to her phenomenal technical and interpretative talents.\\n\\nAdept at the piano as well as having a gifted voice, Franklin became a child prodigy. By the age of fourteen, she signed a record deal with Battle Records, where her father Reverend C.L. Franklin recorded his sermons and gospel vocal recordings, and she issued Songs of Faith in 1956.\\n\\nShe is the second most honored female popular singer in Grammy history (after Alison Krauss), having won eighteen competitive Grammys (including an unprecedented eleven for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, eight of them consecutive). The state of Michigan has declared her voice to be a natural wonder.\\n\\nFranklin is perhaps best-known for her interpretation of Otis Redding\\'s Respect, recorded in 1967 with sisters Carolyn Franklin and Erma Franklin. Many of her songs, however, were originals that have since been covered by other artists. Some of her best-known compositions include (Sweet Sweet Baby) Since You\\'ve Been Gone, Ain\\'t No Way, All the King\\'s Horses, Baby, Baby, Baby, Call Me, Dr. Feelgood, Rock Steady, Spirit in the Dark, and Think (which she performed in the film The Blues Brothers).\\n\\nOn March 25, 1942, Aretha Louise Franklin was born at 406 Lucy Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee, to Barbara (née Siggers) and Clarence LaVaughn \"C. L.\" Franklin. Her father was a Baptist minister and circuit preacher originally from Shelby, Mississippi, while her mother was an accomplished piano player and vocalist. Her parents both had children, three in total, from outside their marriage. The family relocated to Buffalo, New York, when Aretha was two. Before her fifth birthday, in 1946, C. L. Franklin permanently relocated the family to Detroit, Michigan where he took over the pastorship of New Bethel Baptist Church. Aretha\\'s parents had a troubled marriage due to stories of her father\\'s philandering and in 1948, the couple separated, with Barbara relocating back to Buffalo with her son, Vaughn, from a previous relationship. Contrary to popular belief, her mother did not abandon her children; not only did Aretha recall seeing her mother in Buffalo during the summer, but Barbara also frequently visited her children in Detroit. Aretha\\'s mother died of a heart attack on March 7, 1952, before Aretha\\'s tenth birthday. The news of her mother\\'s death was broken by her father, who had gathered Aretha and her siblings in the kitchen to tell them and that he \"could not have been more understanding.\" Several women, including Aretha\\'s grandmother, Rachel, and Mahalia Jackson took turns helping with the children at the Franklin home. During this time, Aretha learned how to play piano by ear.\\n\\nAretha\\'s father\\'s emotionally driven sermons resulted in his being known as the man with the \"million-dollar voice\" and earning thousands of dollars for sermons in various churches across the country. His celebrity status led to his home being visited by various celebrities, among them gospel musicians Clara Ward, James Cleveland and early Caravans members Albertina Walker and Inez Andrews as well as Martin Luther King Jr., Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke. Ward was not only a visitor to the home, but was romantically involved with Aretha\\'s father, though \"she preferred to view them strictly as friends.\" Ward also served as a role model to the young Aretha. Franklin attended Northern High School but later dropped out during her sophomore year.\\n\\nMusic career\\n\\nBeginnings (1952–1960)\\n\\nJust after her mother\\'s death, Franklin began singing solos at New Bethel, debuting with the hymn, \"Jesus, Be a Fence Around Me.\" When Franklin was 12, her father began managing her, bringing her on the road with him during his so-called \"gospel caravan\" tours for her to perform in various churches. He helped his daughter sign her first recording deal with J.V.B. Records, where her first album, Songs of Faith, was released in 1956. Franklin sometimes traveled with The Soul Stirrers during this time. In 1958, Franklin and her father traveled to California, where she met Sam Cooke. At the age of 16, Franklin went on tour with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and in 1968 sang at his funeral.\\n\\nAs a young gospel singer, Franklin spent summers on the circuit in Chicago, staying with Mavis Staples\\' family. After turning 18, Franklin confided to her father that she aspired to follow Sam Cooke in recording pop music, and moved to New York. Serving as her manager, C. L. agreed to the move and helped to produce a two-song demo that soon was brought to the attention of Columbia Records, who agreed to sign her in 1960. Franklin was signed as a \"five-percent artist\". During this period, Franklin would be coached by choreographer Cholly Atkins to prepare for her pop performances. Before signing with Columbia, Sam Cooke tried to persuade Franklin\\'s father to have his label, RCA, sign Franklin. He had also been courted by local record label owner Berry Gordy to sign Franklin and her elder sister Erma to his Tamla label. Franklin\\'s father felt the label was not established enough yet. Franklin\\'s first Columbia single, \"Today I Sing the Blues\", was issued in September 1960 and later reached the top ten of the Hot Rhythm & Blues Sellers chart.\\n\\nInitial success (1961–1966)\\n\\nIn January 1961, Columbia issued Franklin\\'s first secular album, Aretha: With The Ray Bryant Combo. The album featured her first single to chart the Billboard Hot 100, \"Won\\'t Be Long\", which also peaked at number 7 on the R&B chart. Mostly produced by Clyde Otis, Franklin\\'s Columbia recordings saw her performing in diverse genres such as standards, vocal jazz, blues, doo-wop and rhythm and blues. Before the year was out, Franklin scored her first top 40 single with her rendition of the standard, \"Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody\", which also included the R&B hit, \"Operation Heartbreak\", on its b-side. \"Rock-a-Bye\" became her first international hit, reaching the top 40 in Australia and Canada. By the end of 1961, Franklin was named as a \"new-star female vocalist\" in DownBeat magazine. In 1962, Columbia issued two more albums, The Electrifying Aretha Franklin and The Tender, the Moving, the Swinging Aretha Franklin, the latter of which reached No. 69 on the Billboard chart.\\n\\nIn the 1960s during a performance at the Regal Theater, a WVON radio personality announced Franklin should be crowned, \"the Queen of Soul\". By 1964, Franklin began recording more pop music, reaching the top ten on the R&B chart with the ballad \"Runnin\\' Out of Fools\" in early 1965. She had two R&B charted singles in 1965 and 1966 with the songs \"One Step Ahead\" and \"Cry Like a Baby\", while also reaching the Easy Listening charts with the ballads \"You Made Me Love You\" and \"(No, No) I\\'m Losing You\". By the mid-1960s, Franklin was netting $100,000 from countless performances in nightclubs and theaters. Also during that period, she appeared on rock and roll shows such as Hollywood A Go-Go and Shindig!. However, she struggled with commercial success while at Columbia. Label executive John H. Hammond later said he felt Columbia did not understand Franklin\\'s early gospel background and failed to bring that aspect out further during her period there.\\n\\nCommercial success (1967–1979)\\n\\nIn November 1966, after six years with Columbia, Franklin chose not to renew her contract with the company and signed to Atlantic Records. In January 1967, she traveled to Muscle Shoals, Alabama, to record at FAME Studios and recorded the song, \"I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)\", backed by the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. Franklin only spent one day recording at FAME, as an altercation broke out between manager and husband Ted White, studio owner Rick Hall, and a horn player, and sessions were abandoned. The song was released the following month and reached number one on the R&B chart, while also peaking at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Franklin her first top-ten pop single. The song\\'s b-side, \"Do Right Woman, Do Right Man\", reached the R&B top 40, peaking at number 37. In April, Atlantic issued her frenetic version of Otis Redding\\'s \"Respect\", which shot to number one on both the R&B and pop charts. \"Respect\" became her signature song and was later hailed as a civil rights and feminist anthem.\\n\\nFranklin\\'s debut Atlantic album, I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You, also became commercially successful, later going gold. Franklin scored two more top-ten singles in 1967, including \"Baby I Love You\" and \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\". Her rapport with producer Jerry Wexler helped in the creation of the majority of Franklin\\'s peak recordings with Atlantic. In 1968, she issued the top-selling albums Lady Soul and Aretha Now, which included some of Franklin\\'s most popular hit singles, including \"Chain of Fools\", \"Ain\\'t No Way\", \"Think\" and \"I Say a Little Prayer\". That February, Franklin earned the first two of her Grammys, including the debut category for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance. On February 16, Franklin was honored with a day named for her and was greeted by longtime friend Martin Luther King Jr. who gave her the SCLC Drum Beat Award for Musicians just two months before his death. Franklin toured outside the US for the first time in May, including an appearance at the Concertgebouw, Amsterdam where she played to a near hysterical audience who covered the stage with flower petals. She appeared on the cover of Time magazine in June.\\n\\nFranklin\\'s success expanded during the early 1970s, during which she recorded top-ten singles such as \"Spanish Harlem\", \"Rock Steady\" and \"Day Dreaming\" as well as the acclaimed albums Spirit in the Dark, Young, Gifted and Black, and her gospel album, Amazing Grace, which sold more than two million copies. In 1971, Franklin became the first R&B performer to headline Fillmore West, later that year releasing the live album Aretha Live at Fillmore West. Franklin\\'s career began to experience problems while recording the album, Hey Now Hey, which featured production from Quincy Jones. Despite the success of the single \"Angel\", the album bombed upon its release in 1973. Franklin continued having R&B success with songs such as \"Until You Come Back to Me\" and \"I\\'m in Love\", but by 1975 her albums and songs were no longer top sellers. After Jerry Wexler left Atlantic for Warner Bros. Records in 1976, Franklin worked on the soundtrack to the film Sparkle with Curtis Mayfield. The album yielded Franklin\\'s final top 40 hit of the decade, \"Something He Can Feel\", which also peaked at number one on the R&B chart. Franklin\\'s follow-up albums for Atlantic, including Sweet Passion (1977), Almighty Fire (1978) and La Diva (1979), bombed on the charts, and in 1979 Franklin opted to leave the company.\\n\\nLater years (1979–2018)\\n\\nIn 1980, after leaving Atlantic Records,[48] Franklin signed with Clive Davis\\'s Arista Records and that same year gave a command performance at London\\'s Royal Albert Hall in front of Queen Elizabeth. Franklin also had an acclaimed guest role as a waitress in the 1980 comedy musical The Blues Brothers.[49][50] Franklin\\'s first Arista album, Aretha (1980), featured the No. 3 R&B hit \"United Together\" and her Grammy-nominated cover of Otis Redding\\'s \"I Can\\'t Turn You Loose\". The follow-up, 1981\\'s Love All the Hurt Away, included her famed duet of the title track with George Benson, while the album also included her Grammy-winning cover of Sam & Dave\\'s \"Hold On, I\\'m Comin\\'\". Franklin achieved a gold record—for the first time in seven years—with the 1982 album Jump to It. The album\\'s title track was her first top-40 single on the pop charts in six years.\\n\\nIn 1985, inspired by a desire to have a \"younger sound\" in her music, Who\\'s Zoomin\\' Who? became her first Arista album to be certified platinum. The album sold well over a million copies thanks to the hits \"Freeway of Love\", the title track, and \"Another Night\". The following year\\'s Aretha album nearly matched this success with the hit singles \"Jumpin\\' Jack Flash\", \"Jimmy Lee\" and \"I Knew You Were Waiting for Me\", her international number-one duet with George Michael. During that period, Franklin provided vocals to the theme songs of the TV shows A Different World and Together. In 1987, she issued her third gospel album, One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism, which was recorded at her late father\\'s New Bethel church, followed by Through the Storm in 1989. Franklin\\'s 1991 album, What You See is What You Sweat, flopped on the charts. She returned to the charts in 1993 with the dance song \"A Deeper Love\" and returned to the top 40 with the song \"Willing to Forgive\" in 1994.\\n\\nIn 1998, Franklin returned to the top 40 with the Lauryn Hill-produced song \"A Rose Is Still a Rose\", later issuing the album of the same name, which went gold. That same year, Franklin earned international acclaim for her performance of \"Nessun dorma\" at the Grammy Awards, filling in at the last minute for Luciano Pavarotti, who had cancelled after the show had already begun. Her final Arista album, So Damn Happy, was released in 2003 and featured the Grammy-winning song \"Wonderful\". In 2004, Franklin announced that she was leaving Arista after more than 20 years with the label. To complete her Arista obligations, Franklin issued the duets compilation album Jewels in the Crown: All-Star Duets with the Queen in 2007. The following year, she issued the holiday album This Christmas, Aretha, on DMI Records.\\n\\nFranklin performed The Star-Spangled Banner with Aaron Neville and Dr. John for Super Bowl XL, held in her hometown of Detroit in February 2006. She later made international headlines for performing \"My Country, \\'Tis of Thee\" at President Barack Obama\\'s inaugural ceremony with her church hat becoming a popular topic online. In 2010, Franklin accepted an honorary degree from Yale University. In 2011, under her own label, Aretha\\'s Records, she issued the album Aretha: A Woman Falling Out of Love.\\n\\nIn 2014, Franklin was signed under RCA Records, controller of the Arista catalog and a sister label to Columbia via Sony Music Entertainment, and was working with Clive Davis. An album was planned with producers Babyface and Danger Mouse. On September 29, 2014, Franklin performed to a standing ovation, with Cissy Houston as backup, a compilation of Adele\\'s \"Rolling in the Deep\" and \"Ain\\'t No Mountain High Enough\" on the Late Show with David Letterman. Franklin\\'s cover of \"Rolling in the Deep\" was featured among nine other songs in her first RCA release, Aretha Franklin Sings the Great Diva Classics, released in October 2014. In doing so, she became the first woman to have 100 songs on Billboard′s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart with the success of her cover of Adele\\'s \"Rolling in the Deep\", which debuted at number 47 on the chart.\\n\\n\\nFranklin, waiting to perform at the White House in 2015\\nIn December 2015, Franklin gave an acclaimed performance of \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\" at the 2015 Kennedy Center Honors during the section for honoree Carole King, who co-wrote the song. During the bridge of the song, Franklin dropped her fur coat to the stage, for which the audience rewarded her with a mid-performance standing ovation. She returned to Detroit\\'s Ford Field on Thanksgiving Day 2016 to once again perform the national anthem before the game between the Minnesota Vikings and Detroit Lions. Seated behind the piano, wearing a black fur coat and Lions stocking cap, Franklin gave a rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" that lasted more than four minutes and featured a host of improvizations. Franklin released the album A Brand New Me in November 2017 with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, which uses archived recordings from her past. It peaked at number 5 on the Billboard Top Classical Albums chart.\\n\\nMusic style and image\\nAccording to Richie Unterberger, Franklin was \"one of the giants of soul music, and indeed of American pop as a whole. More than any other performer, she epitomized soul at its most gospel-charged.\" She had often been described as a great singer and musician due to \"vocal flexibility, interpretive intelligence, skillful piano-playing, her ear, her experience\". Franklin\\'s voice was described as being a \"powerful mezzo-soprano voice\". She was praised for her arrangements and interpretations of other artists\\' hit songs. Describing Franklin\\'s voice as a youngster on her first album, Songs of Faith, released in 1956 when she was just 14, Jerry Wexler explained that it \"was not that of a child but rather of an ecstatic hierophant\".\\n\\nPersonal life\\n\\nAfter being raised in Detroit, Franklin relocated to New York City in the 1960s, where she lived until moving to Los Angeles in the mid-1970s. She eventually settled in Encino, Los Angeles where she lived until 1982. She then returned to the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills, Michigan to be close to her ailing father and siblings. Franklin maintained a residence there until her death. Following an incident in 1984, she cited a fear of flying that prevented her from traveling overseas; she performed only in North America afterwards. Franklin was the mother of four sons. She first became pregnant at the age of 12 and gave birth to her first child, named Clarence after her father, on January 28, 1955. According to the news site Inquisitr, \"The father of the child was Donald Burk, a boy she knew from school.\" On January 22, 1957, then aged 14, Franklin had a second child, named Edward after his father Edward Jordan. Franklin did not like to discuss her early pregnancies with interviewers.\\n\\nBoth children took her family name. While Franklin was pursuing her career and \"hanging out with [friends]\", Franklin\\'s grandmother Rachel and sister Erma took turns raising the children. Franklin would visit them often. Franklin\\'s third child, Ted White Jr., was born in February 1964 and is known professionally as Teddy Richards. He has provided guitar backing for his mother\\'s band during live concerts. Her youngest son, Kecalf Cunningham was born in 1970 and is the child of her road manager Ken Cunningham.\\n\\nFranklin was married twice. Her first husband was Theodore \"Ted\" White, whom she married in 1961 at age 19. Franklin had actually seen White the first time at a party held at her house in 1954. After a contentious marriage that involved domestic violence, Franklin separated from White in 1968, divorcing him in 1969. Franklin then married her second husband, actor Glynn Turman, on April 11, 1978 at her father\\'s church. By marrying Turman, Franklin became stepmother of Turman\\'s three children from a previous marriage. Franklin and Turman separated in 1982 after Franklin returned to Michigan from California, and they divorced in 1984. At one point, Franklin had plans to marry her longtime companion Willie Wilkerson. Franklin and Wilkerson had had two previous engagements stretching back to 1988. Franklin eventually called the 2012 engagement off. Franklin\\'s sisters, Erma and Carolyn, were professional musicians as well and spent years performing background vocals on Franklin\\'s recordings. Following Franklin\\'s divorce from Ted White, her brother Cecil became her manager, and maintained that position until his death from lung cancer on December 26, 1989. Sister Carolyn died the previous year in April 1988 from breast cancer, while eldest sister Erma died from throat cancer in September 2002. Franklin\\'s step-brother Vaughn died two months after Erma in late 2002. Her half-sister, Carl Kelley (née Jennings; born 1940) is C. L. Franklin\\'s daughter by Mildred Jennings, a then 12-year-old congregant of New Salem Baptist Church in Memphis, where C. L. was pastor.\\n\\nFranklin was performing at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas, on June 10, 1979, when her father, C. L., was shot twice at point blank range in his Detroit home.[92] After six months at Henry Ford Hospital, still in a state of coma, C.L. was moved back to his home with 24-hour nursing care. Aretha moved back to Detroit in late 1982 to assist with the care of her father, who died at Detroit\\'s New Light Nursing Home on July 27, 1984.[93] Some of her music business friends have included Dionne Warwick, Mavis Staples, and Cissy Houston, who began singing with Franklin as members of the Sweet Inspirations. Cissy sang background on Franklin\\'s hit \"Ain\\'t No Way\". Franklin first met Cissy\\'s daughter, Whitney, in the early 1970s. She was made Whitney\\'s honorary aunt, not a godmother as has been occasionally misreported, and Whitney often referred to her as \"Auntie Ree\".\\n\\nWhen Whitney Houston died on February 11, 2012, Franklin said she was surprised by her death. She had initially planned to perform at Houston\\'s memorial service on February 18, but her representative claimed that Franklin suffered a leg spasm and was unable to attend. In response to criticism of her non-attendance, she stated, \"God knows I wanted to be there, but I couldn\\'t.\"\\nFranklin was a registered Democrat.\\n\\nHealth problems\\nFranklin dealt with weight issues for years. In 1974, she dropped 40 pounds (18 kg) during a crash diet and maintained her new weight until the end of the decade.[100] She again lost weight in the early 1990s, before gaining some back. A former chain smoker who struggled with alcoholism, she quit smoking in 1992. She admitted in 1994 that her smoking was \"messing with my voice\", but after quitting smoking she said later, in 2003, that her weight \"ballooned\".\\n\\nIn 2010, Franklin canceled a number of concerts, after she decided to have surgery for an undisclosed tumor. Discussing the surgery in 2011, she quoted her doctor as saying that it would \"add 15 to 20 years\" to her life. She denied that the ailment had anything to do with pancreatic cancer, as had been rumored. On May 19, 2011, Franklin had her comeback show in the Chicago Theatre. In May 2013, she canceled two performances to deal with an undisclosed medical treatment. Later the same month, she canceled three June concerts and planned to return to perform in July. A show scheduled for July 27 in Clarkston, Michigan was canceled due to continued medical treatment. In addition, she canceled an appearance at a Major League Baseball luncheon in Chicago honoring her commitment to civil rights on August 24. She also canceled a performance of September 21 in Atlanta due to her health recovery. During a phone interview with the Associated Press in late August 2013, Franklin stated that she had a \"miraculous\" recovery from her undisclosed illness but had to cancel shows and appearances until her health was at 100%, estimating she was about \"85% healed\". Franklin later returned to live performing, including a 2013 Christmas concert at Detroit\\'s MotorCity Casino Hotel. She launched a multi-city tour in mid-2014, starting with a performance on June 14 in New York at Radio City Music Hall.\\n\\nIn 2017, Franklin canceled a series of concerts due to health reasons. During an outdoor Detroit show, she asked the audience to \"keep me in your prayers\". In July 2017, Franklin reemerged, appearing to have lost more weight before a performance at the Wolf Trap in Virginia. In 2018, she canceled a series of shows, citing doctor\\'s orders. Franklin\\'s final performance was at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine in New York City during Elton John\\'s 25th anniversary gala for the Elton John AIDS Foundation on November 7, 2017.\\n\\nFinal illness and death\\nOn August 13, 2018, Franklin was reported to be gravely ill at her home in Riverfront Towers, Detroit. She was reported to be under hospice care and surrounded by friends and family. Stevie Wonder, Jesse Jackson, and ex-husband Glynn Turman, among others, visited her on her deathbed. Franklin died at her home on August 16, 2018, aged 76. The cause was reported to be pancreatic cancer. Numerous celebrities in the entertainment industry and politicians paid tribute to Franklin, including former U.S. president Barack Obama who said she \"helped define the American experience\". Civil rights activist and minister Al Sharpton called her a \"civil rights and humanitarian icon\".\\n\\nA private funeral was arranged for August 31, following a two-day public viewing of Franklin\\'s casket at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History in Detroit.\\n\\nLegacy and honors\\n\\nFranklin wipes a tear after being given the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 9, 2005, at the White House. She is seated between fellow recipients Robert Conquest (left) and Alan Greenspan.\\nFranklin received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1979, had her voice declared a Michigan \"natural resource\" in 1985, and became the first woman inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences awarded her a Grammy Legend Award in 1991, then the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994. Franklin was a Kennedy Center Honoree in 1994, recipient of the National Medal of Arts in 1999, and was bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005. She was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2005.\\n\\nFranklin became the second woman inducted to the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. She was the 2008 MusiCares Person of the Year, performing at the Grammys days later. Following news of Franklin\\'s surgery and recovery in February 2011, the Grammys ceremony paid tribute to the singer with a medley of her classics performed by Christina Aguilera, Florence Welch, Jennifer Hudson, Martina McBride, and Yolanda Adams. That same year she was ranked 19th among the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time top artists, and ranked first on the Rolling Stone list of Greatest Singers of All Time.

Born in Boca Raton, Florida, Grande began her career in 2008 in the Broadway musical, 13. She rose to prominence for her role as Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television series, Victorious (2010–2013) and in its spin-off, Sam & Cat (2013–2014). As she grew interested in pursuing a music career, Grande recorded songs for the soundtrack of Victorious and signed with Republic Records in 2011 after the label\\'s executives discovered videos of her covering songs that she uploaded onto YouTube. She released her debut album, Yours Truly, in 2013. A 1950s doo-wop-influenced pop and R&B album, it debuted atop the US Billboard 200 and spawned her first US top-ten single, \"The Way\", featuring rapper Mac Miller. \\n\\nGrande\\'s second studio album, My Everything (2014), continued the pop-R&B sound of its predecessor and incorporated EDM elements. It topped the Billboard 200 and featured four US top-ten singles: \"Problem\", \"Break Free\", \"Bang Bang\", and \"Love Me Harder\" featuring The Weeknd, the most of any artist that year. Grande\\'s pop-R&B styles extended on her third studio album, Dangerous Woman (2016), which was her first of three consecutive number-one albums in the UK, and spawned top ten hits such as the Grammy nominated title track and \"Side to Side\". \\n\\nOn her next two albums, Sweetener (2018) and Thank U, Next (2019), Grande experimented with trap while maintaining her characteristic pop-R&B tones; being projects with her most creative control yet and showing a more personal and vulnerable side, both debuted at number one in several countries and were acclaimed by music critics. The former won a Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Album and spawned the international top three hit \"No Tears Left to Cry\", while the latter broke several streaming records. Grande became the first solo artist to hold the top three spots on the Billboard Hot 100 simultaneously when \"7 Rings\", \"Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I\\'m Bored\" and \"Thank U, Next\" did so in 2019. She is also the first artist to have the lead singles from each of their first five studio albums debut within the top ten in the US.\\n\\nGrande released her sixth studio album, Positions (2020) with its lead single, \"Positions\" debuting at number one in the US and the UK simultaneously. A deluxe version of Positions was released in February 2021, with four new songs and a remix of \"34+35\" featuring Doja Cat and Megan Thee Stallion.\\n\\nGrande has received various accolades, including two Grammy Awards, one Brit Award, two Billboard Music Awards, and three American Music Awards. All five of Grande\\'s full-length albums have been certified platinum by the RIAA. As one of the leading streaming pioneers in the world, she has amassed over 35 billion streams on platforms like YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music and is the most listened female on the latter two. An influential figure on social media, she is an outspoken feminist and supporter for LGBT rights. She asserts control over her public image and is known for her ponytail hairdo and bold fashion statements. In February 2019, she became the most followed woman on Instagram. Forbes ranked her amongst the highest-paid celebrities in 2019, and Time named Grande as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2016 and 2019.

He graduated from the Stockbridge School of Massachusetts in 1965, and briefly attended Rocky Mountain College.\\n\\nHis most famous work is Alice\\'s Restaurant, a talking blues song that lasts eighteen minutes and twenty seconds (in its original recorded version; Guthrie has been known to spin the story out to forty-five minutes in concert). The song, a bitingly satirical protest against the Vietnam War draft, is based on a true incident. In the song, Guthrie was called up for a draft examination, and rejected as unfit for military service as a result of a criminal record consisting in its entirety of a single arrest, court appearance, fine and clean-up order for littering. In reality, Guthrie, though a carrier of the genetically inherited disease Huntington\\'s chorea, was classified as fit (1A); however, his draft-lottery number did not come up. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Arlo+Guthrie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Armand Van Helden is a house music artist and music remixer whose biggest commercial successes came from his remixes of the 1996 Tori Amos song \"Professional Widow\", which reached the top of the UK singles chart, and his own track \"You Don\\'t Know Me\" which was Number 1 in the UK in January 1999.\\n\\nVan Helden was born in Boston on February 17, 1970 to a Dutch-Indonesian father and a French-Lebanese mother, but travelled around the world as a child spending time in the Netherlands, Turkey and Italy, as his father was a member of the US Air Force. At the age of thirteen, he bought a drum machine and started DJing two years later.\\n\\nHe returned to Boston in 1988 but also moonlighted as a DJ in Boston clubs. He attended Boston University. He quit his legal review job in 1989 to work as a remixer/producer for Mega-Mixx Productions DJ Remix Service (co-founded by his long time manager, Neil Petricone) where he reworked and re-edited a number of club records for the DJ-only service, including Shawn Christopher\\'s \"Another Sleepless Night.\" He also took up an occupancy at \\'The Loft\\', Boston\\'s leading nightclub. \\n\\nMega-Mixx\\'s success was short lived. Mismanagement brought the company to a halt in early 1991. Later that year, he and Petricone, along with founding A&R coordinator, Tony Zeoli, launched X-Mix Productions, a similar DJ Remix service, which still exists today (http://www.xmix.com). Catching the attention of legendary Strictly Rhythm and Nervous Records A&R guru, Glady Pizarro, in 1992 Van Helden released his first official single \"Stay On My Mind\" under the psuedonym Deep Creed, through Nervous Records.\\n\\nHe released \"Move It To the Left\" (credited to Sultans of Swing) in 1992 on the Strictly Rhythm label, which became a moderate club hit. His first track to make the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart was \"Witch Doktor\" which made the top 5 in 1994.\\n\\nThe success of \"Witch Doktor\" led to opportunities to remix acts such as The Real McCoy (\"Another Night\", New Order (\"Bizarre Love Triangle\"), Blondie (\"Atomic), Capella (\"U Got To Know\"), Lightning Seeds (\"Jackie Lucky\"), Deep Forest (\"Marta\\'s Song\"), Jimmy Somerville (\"Heartbeat\"), Deee-Lite (\"Dewdrops In The Garden\") and Faithless (\"Insomnia\"). However, it was the \"Professional Widow\" remix that established him and became a dance hit around the world as well as a number one hit in the UK. Unfortunately, Van Helden did not receive a penny for this mix as he presented it uncommissioned, and thus was not entitled to compensation. However, it led to work remixing The Rolling Stones, Janet Jackson, Britney Spears and Puff Daddy as well as Daft Punk and the Sneaker Pimps, and adding to his reputation as one of the world\\'s top house musicians.\\n\\nWithin dance music circles, Van Helden is widely credited for the introduction of the U.K. bred Speed Garage sound to the U.S. club scene with incredible set of remixes. The sound, identifiable by its deep bass subtones, long melodic breaks, and devestatingly hard hitting beats are exemplified in the following remixes beginning in 1995 with Jimmy Somerville \"Heartbeat\"; CJ Bolland\\'s \"Sugar Is Sweeter\"; Faithless \"Insomnia\"; Tori Amos \"Professional Widow\"; Apollo 440 \"Ain\\'t Talkin\\' \\'Bout Dub\"; and Sneaker Pimps \"Spin, Spin, Sugar.\"\\n\\n\"Cha Cha\" was another top ten dance hit from his first album Old School Junkies released in 1996, along with \"The Funk Phenomena\". A greatest hits album appeared the next year followed by a breakbeat album later in 1997. \"U Don\\'t Know Me,\" a collaboration with vocalist Duane Harden from the album, \"2 Futur 4 U,\" was a number two hit on the Billboard dance chart, a Number one in the UK and a top 20 single on the pop charts in Australia and Canada.\\n\\nIn 1000 UK #1 Hits by Jon Kutner and Spencer Leigh, Armand Van Helden explained, \"You Don\\'t Know Me was a perfect example of putting 2 simple things together, the beats from Jaydee\\'s Plastic Dreams and a disco loop from Carrie Lucas.\"\\n\\nVan Helden released the Killing Puritans album in 2000 which contained the dance hit \"Koochy\". His single \"Why Can\\'t You Spend Some Time\" made the number 34 in the UK in 2001. His New York: A Mix Odyssey album released in 2004 produced two hits:\\n\\n    * \"Hear my Name\" reached number 7 on the Billboard dance chart, was top 30 on world and internet charts, made number 34 in the UK, and reached the top 40 in Australia; and\\n    * \"My My My\" reached number 4 on the world internet charts, number 5 in the Belgian and Dutch charts, number 6 in Australia, number 15 in the UK and top 30 in the world dance charts.\\n\\nIn 2010 Van Helden teamed with A-Trak to form the duo Duck Sauce.

       " 'Armin van Buuren (born Armin Jozef Jacobus Daniël van Buuren, December 25, 1976) is a trance (mostly progressive trance and uplifting trance) music producer and DJ from the Netherlands. His musical career started in 1995.\\n\\nHe has been named number one in the prestigious DJ MAG Top 100 poll four times in a row, from 2007 till 2010 and for the 5th time in 2012. He\\'s the first DJ in the history of the DJ Magazine to achieve that and an indication of his prolific output over more than 14 years he’s been dj’ing and producing. Being the official World’s Most Popular DJ is just one of his many achievements, but the driving force behind his success is an overriding passion for electronic dance music.\\n\\n2008 began with the success that the number one DJ seems to attract; he was awarded with the prestigious Buma Cultuur Pop Award in January. This was followed by being voted as the Best Trance Artist in the Beatport Music Awards in March; judged on the musician’s artistic achievements, national and international success, it is evident that Armin van Buuren has become one of the decade’s most influential trance acts.\\n\\nEven a basic list of recent successes reads like a lifetime of work: ‘Best Album’ for artist album ‘Shivers’ at both the Dutch Release Dance Awards and the prestigious Edison Awards; ‘Best Compilation’ for ‘A State Of Trance’, in 2006, claiming the ‘Best European DJ’ award in 2007 and ‘Best Mix Radio Show’ at the Miami Winter Music Conference in 2006 and 2007, for radio show ‘A State Of Trance’ – now broadcasting on a massive 40 FM stations as well as satellite and internet radio, with over 26 million listeners a week; a 5th year residency in Ibiza at Amnesia and over 50,000 downloads every week from podcasting high end chart-bothering positions all over the world for singles, albums and compilations , with single “Rush Hour” used as the theme tune to the UEFA European Youth Championship; the #1 entry in the Dutch album charts with his artist album ‘Imagine’, the #1 entry of the DVD registration of ‘Armin Only ‘ Imagine’ – the landmarks just keep coming!\\n\\nThe 350th episode and the 7th year of the hit radio show ‘A State of Trance’ was celebrated in May 2008 with an eight hour live broadcast from Antwerp in Belgium to over 40 radio stations internationally. Fans were invited to a free party with a line up that had been voted for by the show’s listeners; another example of the importance the DJ places on the satisfaction of his fans. Considering the popularity of the radio show the introduction of ‘A State of Trance Podcast’ was a natural progression. The weekly podcasts which contain highlights and Armin’s favourite tracks from the previous episode ensure that trance lovers across the world will never miss another episode!\\nSold-out shows for Armin Only in 2005 and 2006 created eager anticipation of the third edition, which kicked off in a sold-out Jaarbeurs in Utrecht in 2008; over 16,000 fans attended and were enthralled by the DJ’s nine hour set. The theme of the night was ‘Imagine’, described by Armin as “the celebration of our sensations both in life and in clubland.” Fans all around the world should not despair, as ‘Armin Only’ tour dates have also been set for Romania, Poland, Belgium and Australia; the DJ will also be touring in England, Scotland, Ibiza, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, and the USA, with expected dates in, for an example, the Czech Republic.\\n\\nBorn in Leiden, Holland (on December 25, 1976) to a musical family, Armin indulged his passion for music from a young age. He spent all the money he earned with his paper round on records. His mum won a computer when he was 10, gaining Armin’s interest. “So as a little nerdy kid I was writing my own basic programmes, and learnt about the technology from there.” He progressed from making low-profile mix tapes for friends to higher profile mixes when he discovered experimenting with different sequences on his computer through his uncle. “I was so stunned by what I saw him doing on the computer, that I got addicted to creating music right there and then!”\\n“I loved dance music immediately – this great rebellious sound that was so different to the ‘beautiful’ songs of the years before”. Armin cites electronic pioneer Jean Michel Jarre as a major influence (famed for his awesome visuals as well as his groundbreaking synth sounds), as well as Dutch producer Ben Liebrand, who later mentored him in his mixing and producing.\\nIn the early days, Armin thought it was wise to have something extra in case the DJ’ing didn’t work out. So he studied for a law degree. The final year of his course was inevitably stretched as he juggled his studies with his increasingly hectic schedule; his rise to fame included lots of productions and remixes, as well as playing out to packed clubs every weekend. It took him three years to graduate, but his determination made him succeed!\\n\\nArmin’s own productions have all made a huge impact and quickly gain worldwide acclaim; his latest artist album titled ‘Imagine’ entered the Dutch Album Top 100 Chart at number one; this is the first time a dance producer has ever accomplished such a feat in the history of Dutch music. The first single to be taken from this album, ‘Going Wrong’ with DJ Shah featuring Chris Jones, entered the Dutch Singles Chart at number five. The ‘Armin Only DVD’ was also released and reached the acclaimed number one spot in its second week. His back catalogue includes Blue Fear, Communication, Sound of Goodbye, Shivers, Rush Hour, Burned With Desire, Exhale, Love You More, This World Is Watching Me, and Yet Another Day. While the remix offers flood in, Armin only takes on tracks that he really loves. He uses exactly the same criteria for his compilations, meaning that every release from Armin or his long-running Armind label is a bone fide stormer that’s earned its place. His output includes tracks for the cult TV series 24, and the likes of Motorcycle’s As The Rush Comes.\\nArmin is a dedicated trance lover, but isn’t imprisoned by a single genre, saying “What makes trance work so well is that it doesn’t stick to one style, and can incorporate electro, minimal, whatever it likes.” His desire to showcase more of the great music he hears, along with the number of people sending him tracks they wanted to release, led to the obvious step of starting his own label, Armada, in 2003.\\n\\nThe label is a joint venture between Armin, Maykel Piron (former head of A&R for Warner Music) and David Lewis, who\\'d previously managed Armin. \"What we wanted was a company that could offer everything for an artist: representation, a booking agency, and a record company. Artists can choose full management, or to just release a record or play out at gigs. Armada lets the artists choose what they want without telling them what to do\".\\nArmin is now a fully-fledged artist in his own right, having made his songwriting debut on his album, the award-winning Shivers; The events continue to get bigger and bigger, and Armin regularly headlines the likes of Sensation White, Global Gathering, Dance Valley, ZoukOut, Mysteryland, Coachella, Beats In Brazil, Trance Energy, Fort Dance, Summer Days – basically whether you’re in Australia, Russia, the Middle East, the US or Europe, you can catch Armin van Buuren at a club or festival near you!\\n\"This is just what I really want,\" says Armin. \"It’s not just love for music, it’s my passion. It goes beyond liking, and beyond a hobby, it’s about a way of living. Music is essential to my life”.\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Armin+van+Buuren\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Art Garfunkel (born Arthur Ira Garfunkel on 5 November 1941 in Forest Hills, Queens, NYC, USA) is an American singer and actor, best known as half of the folk duo Simon & Garfunkel. He is of Romanian Jewish ancestry.\\n\\nHe met his future singing partner, Paul Simon, in the sixth grade. Between 1956 and 1962, the two had performed together as Tom & Jerry. Garfunkel (\"Tom Graph\") chose his nickname because he liked to track, or \"graph\" hits, on the pop charts. Garfunkel attended Columbia University in the early sixties, where he sang with the Kingsmen, an all-male a cappella group. While at Columbia, he was also a Brother of the Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity. In 1962 Garfunkel earned a Bachelor of Arts degree majoring in art history, followed eventually by a Master\\'s degree in mathematics.\\n\\nIn 1963 he and Simon reformed the duo under their own names as Simon and Garfunkel and released their first album, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M. on Columbia Records in October 1964. It was not a critical success, and the duo effectively split again after recording. The next year their producer Tom Wilson lifted the song \"The Sound of Silence\" from the record, redubbed an electric backing onto it, and released it as a single, which eventually went to #1 on the Billboard pop charts. They reunited and went on to become two of the most popular artists of the 1960s, releasing a total of five studio albums. However, citing personal differences and divergence in career interests, they split following the release of their most critically acclaimed album, Bridge Over Troubled Water, in 1970.\\n\\nSolo career\\n\\nIn the 1970s, Garfunkel released a few solo albums, and although he did not reach the heights that Simon and Garfunkel had reached, he still scored hits with \"I Only Have Eyes For You\" (a 1934 song originally written by Harry Warren [1]) and \"Bright Eyes\" (both British #1 hit singles), and \"All I Know\" (#9 in the United States). A version of \"Bright Eyes\" also appeared in the movie Watership Down. He briefly reunited with Paul Simon in the 1975 hit \"My Little Town\".\\nArt Garfunkel (centre) with his band after the show at Liseberg fairground on June 4 1998\\nEnlarge\\nArt Garfunkel (centre) with his band after the show at Liseberg fairground on June 4 1998\\n\\nIn between, he also acted in a few movies, including Catch-22 and Carnal Knowledge (1971) with Jack Nicholson, Candice Bergen, and Ann-Margret.\\n\\nFollowing disappointing sales of his 1981 album Scissors Cut, Garfunkel reunited with Paul Simon for the famous concert in Central Park. The subsequent world tour went well musically, but they had disagreements during the tour, with the disappointment for Art Garfunkel that Paul Simon excluded Art\\'s voice from the new album that was announced as a S&G album and came out as a new Paul Simon solo album Hearts and Bones. The reason for that was that Paul Simon\\'s songs were very personal. After this, Garfunkel left the music scene for several years, but returned in 1988 with the album Lefty. None of these projects garnered much critical success, and Garfunkel did not release another album until 1993\\'s Up \\'til Now. Perhaps his most noteworthy recent release is his live 1996 concert Across America, recorded live at the registry hall on Ellis Island. The concert features several musical guests, including James Taylor, Garfunkel\\'s wife, Kim, and his son James Arthur.\\n\\nGarfunkel also performed the theme song for the 1991 television series, \"Brooklyn Bridge\", and in 1998 Garfunkel sang \"The Ballad of Buster Baxter\" for an episode of the PBS Kids cartoon Arthur.\\n\\nRecent events\\n\\nIn 2003, Garfunkel made his debut as a songwriter on his well-received Everything Waits to Be Noticed album. Teaming up with singer-songwriters Maia Sharp and Buddy Mondlock, the album represented some of Garfunkel\\'s strongest solo performances to date, and contained several songs whose origins were poems penned by Garfunkel. Everything Waits to Be Noticed is recognized as his first true effort at songwriting, save his teenage years with Paul Simon in Tom and Jerry.\\n\\nIn 2003, Art Garfunkel and Paul Simon reunited one more time and buried their disagreements once and for all. The world tour in 2003 and 2004 that followed was this time very joyful and was a big success. After the tour, they went their own ways.\\n\\nGarfunkel made news in early 2004 when he was arrested for possession of cannabis.\\n\\nThe only new recording on the collection The Art Garfunkel Album (1984), the song \"Sometimes When I\\'m Dreaming\" (written by Mike Batt), was re-recorded in 2005 by ex ABBA singer Agnetha Fältskog on her comeback album My Colouring Book.\\n\\nIn August 2005, Garfunkel received his second cannabis possession charge after a state police trooper found a joint in the ashtray of his car while in New York State.

       " 'Should melodic hooks and intelligent introspection be mutually exclusive? Not if you ask Sullivan, the North Carolina rock band whose debut album \"Hey I\\'m A Ghost\" boasts a surprising mix of instrumental depth and instantly memorable pop-leaning crooning. Produced by Matt Goldman (Copeland, Underoath) and mixed by Mike Watts, the album is shocking in its depth, recalling the greatest moments of Jimmy Eat World and Sunny Day Real Estate while carving out a niche that is distinctly Sullivan\\'s sole territory. Sullivan has come leaps and bounds from when singer/guitarist Brooks Paschal and bass player Zach Harward were writing songs with a drum machine a few years ago, adding drummer Phil Chamberlain (brother of Underoath vocalist Spencer) and guitarist Tyson Shipman to fully realize their sound and their shared dream of truly connecting with fans emotionally. Sullivan\\'s sophomore album, \"Cover Your Eyes\" came out June 5th 2007 and is a continuation of their melodic hooks and intelligent lyrics.\\n\\n\\nAs of November 10th, 2007, Sullivan has broken up.\\n\\nThere\\'s at least one other band with the name Sullivan. It\\'s a French band and one of their greatest hits was Hashish Faction. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sullivan\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Arthur Alexander (May 10, 1940 – June 9, 1993), born in Florence, Alabama, was perhaps one of the biggest stars to arise out of the American country-soul scene. Working with Muscle Shoals, a pioneering record label, Alexander\\'s \"You Better Move On\" was the label\\'s first hit and perhaps his best-known song, covered by The Rolling Stones. \"Anna (Go to Him)\" a US rhythm and blues Top Ten Hit (covered by The Beatles), \"Soldier of Love\" (covered by The Beatles, Marshall Crenshaw and Pearl Jam) and \"Set Me Free\" (covered by Esther Phillips and Joe Tex) were also major hits and established Alexander as a pioneering arranger of others\\' tunes, as well as an established songwriter in his own right. He switched to another label, Sound Stage 7 founded by Fred Foster, and although a 1972 album for Warner Brothers was promising, the singer\\'s potential seemed to wither. He secured a pop hit with \"Every Day I Have To Cry\" on Buddah Records (1975), but the success remained shortlived. For many years, Alexander was out of the music business; he was a bus driver for much of this time. He began to perform again in 1993 as renewed interest was shown in his small but important catalogue. His last album \"Lonely Just Like Me\" was his first in 21 years. He signed a new recording/publishing contract in May 1993 but suffered the cruelest fate when he collapsed and died of a heart attack the following month, three days after performing in Nashville with his new band.\\n\\nArthur Alexander deserves a special mention in pop and rock history for his particular influence, as indicated, on the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. It is believed that John Lennon, in particular, was heavily influenced in his singing style by Arthur Alexander. The above-mentioned tracks such as \\'Anna\\', \\'You Better Move On\\' and \\'Soldier of Love\\', in particular, but maybe also \\'Go Home Girl\\' might confirm this artist\\'s influence on the Beatles and his influence, if the listener needs further convincing after hearing \\'You Better Move On\\', on the Rolling Stones. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Arthur+Alexander\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Real name: Arthur Baker / Born: April 22 1955, Boston, MA USA\\n\\nArthur Baker was among the most visible and widely-imitated of the early hip-hop producers, masterminding breakthrough experiments with tape edits and synthetic beats before crossing over to introduce the art of remixing into the pop mainstream. He began his career as a club DJ in Boston, and landed his first production work at Emergency Records, debuting with Northend\\'s Happy Days.\" After relocating to New York in 1979, Baker quickly immersed himself in the nascent hip-hop scene; there he was recruited by the Salsoul label to helm a session for Joe Bataan which yielded the rap novelty \"Rap-O-Clap-O.\" His stay in the Big Apple largely unsuccessful, he then returned to Boston, producing a handful of singles which went nowhere, among them Glory\\'s \"Can You Guess What Groove This Is?\" A move back to New York followed, at which time Baker joined the staff of Tommy Boy Records, where he teamed with co-producer Shep Pettibone to record Afrika Bambaataa\\'s groundbreaking 1982 single \"Jazzy Sensation,\" a remake of Gwen McCrae\\'s \"Funky Sensation.\"\\n\\nAssuming sole production control, Baker next reunited with Bambaataa for the classic \"Planet Rock,\" a watershed in hip-hop\\'s early evolution -- a wholly-synthesized record inspired by Kraftwerk\\'s Trans-Europe Express, its programmed beats left an indelible imprint on the music released in its wake. Baker\\'s success at Tommy Boy led to the formation of his own label, Streetwise Records; after helming underground club hits for Rockers Revenge, Nairobi and Citispeak, he signed a then-unknown New Edition, issuing the teen vocal group\\'s debut single \"Candy Girl\" in 1982. Baker\\'s gradual absorption into the pop mainstream continued in 1983, when the cutting-edge British dance group New Order contacted him to produce their single \"Confusion; \" the record became an immediate club classic, even scraping into the American R&B charts. Remixes of the track also help pioneer the remix aesthetic throughout the rock mainstream, and soon Baker was producing material for Naked Eyes, Face to Face, Diana Ross, Jeff Beck and others.\\n\\nIn 1989, he also assembled artists including Al Green, ABC and Jimmy Somerville to record the all-star LP Merge, credited to Arthur Baker and the Backbeat Disciples. After a follow-up, 1991\\'s Give in to the Rhythm, he returned to production, albeit no longer exerting the same kind of influence as in the decade prior.\\n\\n\"The spirit of making dance records is exactly the same to me as its always been. You have more control now in the studio, that\\'s the whole new thing. But the spirit in which people make dance records is still DJs and the kids who want to go to clubs and hear their own records. I\\'ve never made a great dance record that wasn\\'t the direct result of being in a club the night before. Never. When you make a dance record the objective is clear - to make people dance and have a good time. You really can\\'t take it too seriously.\"\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Arthur+Baker\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Arthur Lee Conley (January 4, 1946 – November 17, 2003) was an American soul singer.  He is best known for the 1967 hit Sweet Soul Music which shot to the number two spot on both the pop and R&B charts in America, earning Conley the number eleven male artist ranking for 1967.  The song pays homage to great soul singers like Lou Rawls, Wilson Pickett and James Brown.\\n\\nConley was born in McIntosh County, Georgia and grew up in Atlanta. He first recorded in 1959 as the lead singer of Arthur & the Corvets. With this group he released three singles from 1963 through 1964 (Poor Girl, I Believe, and Flossie Mae) on the Atlanta-based label National Recording Company.\\n\\nIn 1964 he moved to a new label (Ru-Jac Records) and released I\\'m a Lonely Stranger.  When Otis Redding heard it he asked Conley to record a new version, which became the second release on Redding\\'s own fledgling label Jotis Records.\\n\\nConley met Otis Redding in 1967.  After this meeting Redding took Conley under his care and taught him the fine points of the music business. Together they rewrote the Sam Cooke song Yeah Man into Sweet Soul Music, which at Redding\\'s insistence was released on the Atco-distributed label Fame Records. It proved a massive hit and went to the number two position on the U.S. charts and the Top Ten across much of Europe. It is said that Conley never accepted Otis Redding\\'s death of December 1967.\\n\\nAfter several years of lackluster singles in the early 1970s he relocated to England in 1975 and then spent several years in Belgium before settling in the Dutch village of Ruurlo and the cultural centre of Ganzenhoef (an extension southeast of Amsterdam) in 1980.  He legally changed his name to Lee Roberts (his middle name and his mother\\'s maiden name).  He occupied himself with promoting new music by means of his Art-Con Productions company and was also active as a designer of specialized tapestries and furniture.\\n\\nA live performance on January 8, 1980 featuring Lee Roberts & the Sweaters was released as an album titled Soulin\\' in 1988.\\n\\nHe died after a long battle with intestinal cancer in Ruurlo, Netherlands at age 57. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Arthur+Conley\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Arthur H is Arthur Higelin\\'s stage name. Higelin (born Paris, France, 27 March 1966), is a French pianist, songwriter and singer. He is the son of the French singer Jacques Higelin and Nicole Courtois. After traveling in the West Indies, he studied music in Boston before returning to Paris and developing his eclectic but highly personal musical style, drawing on such influences as Thelonious Monk, Serge Gainsbourg, the Sex Pistols, jazz, blues, Middle Eastern music and the tango. He is best known in France for his live performances - four of his albums were recorded live - and remains relatively little-known in the English-speaking world.\\n\\nArthur H first performed in 1988 in clubs in Paris, as leader of a trio with bassist Brad Scott and drummer Paul Jothy. His first album, Arthur H (1990), combined rhythmic experimentation and bal-musette elements with a vocal style which has been compared to Tom Waits. He toured widely around this time, particularly in France and Japan, adding a fourth band member, Jon Handelsman (saxophone), and produced a second album, Bachibouzouk (1992). In early 1993, he did a six week season at the Magic Mirrors, an antique circus big top, which was later put on as a touring show and recorded on the live album En chair et en os. In 1996, he released the album Trouble Fête, following which he performed a season at the Gymnase in Paris. The live album Fête Trouble (1997) included some tracks from these shows as well as others recorded on tour in Africa. He toured the USA and Canada in 1998.\\n\\nIn 2000, he wrote the soundtrack for Michel Couvelard’s film, Inséparables, before touring in Asia and Canada. His next album, Pour Madame X (2000), featured the touring band of Nicolas Repac (guitar), Brad Scott (double bass) and Laurent Robin (drums). In 2001, he took part in the show \"Cabaret Imprudent\" with \"Le Cirque Cahin-caha\". The following year, he released the album Piano Solo, recorded live in a studio and mainly consisting of solo interpretations of earlier songs. This was followed by a band album, Négresse Blanche (2003), comprising tracks dedicated to the memory of famous women such as \"Marilyn Kaddish\" and \"Bo Derek\". In 2005, a planned tour of China was cancelled, and he returned to the studio to record the album Adieu Tristesse. This was the most commercially successful of his career, and included several duets, one with his father and another, \"Est-ce que tu aimes?\", with the musician -M- (Matthieu Chedid). He subsequently toured widely in France, Lebanon and Canada. In 2006 he published a book, \"Onirique attaque\", containing lyrics, reflections and photographs. He also composed the soundtrack for the film \"L’homme qui rêvait d\\'un enfant\", directed by Delphine Gleize. The soundtrack was performed by an ensemble of children from a local music school. The album \"Show Time\", issued late in 2006, was recorded live on tour and includes duets with Matthieu Chedid, Pauline Croze, Lhasa de Sela and Jacques Higelin. In June 2008 he released the album \"L\\'Homme du Monde\".\\n\\nDiscography\\n    * 1990 : Arthur H\\n    * 1991 : Cool Jazz (remixes)\\n    * 1992 : Bachibouzouk\\n    * 1993 : En chair et en os (live)\\n    * 1996 : Trouble-Fête\\n    * 1997 : Fête Trouble (live)\\n    * 1999 : Inséparables (soundtrack)\\n    * 2000 : Pour Madame X\\n    * 2002 : Piano Solo (live)\\n    * 2003 : Négresse Blanche\\n    * 2005 : Adieu Tristesse\\n    * 2006 : Show Time (live)\\n    * 2008 : L\\'Homme du Monde\\n\\nwww.arthurh.net <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Arthur+H\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Arthur Prysock (Born January 2, 1929 in Spartanburg, South Carolina – Died Bermuda, June 7, 1997) was an American baritone singer,  whose widest exposure may have come from singing the \"Tonight, Let It Be Lowenbrau\" beer jingle in the late 1970\\'s. Prysock who recorded for 43 years, released some 60 albums, with bandleaders including Buddy Johnson & Count Basie,  on labels such as Mercury & Verve, but the bulk of his  work was released via the Old Town label. His voice had a deep, rich smokey resonance, comparable to the smooth balladeering of Billy Eckstine, Brook Benton or Lou Rawls. \\n\\n In 1944 popular touring bandleader Buddy Johnson found Prysock in Hartford Connecticut and signed him as a vocalist. Prysock became a mainstay of the live big band performance circuit, singing on several of Buddy Johnson’s hits on Decca Records (\"Jet My Love\", 1947 and \"I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone\", 1948) and later on Mercury Records (\"Because\", 1950). Other signature tracks that Prysock recorded for Buddy Johnson\\'s Orchestra between 1944 and 1952 included “They All Say I’m the Biggest Fool,” and “At Last.” \\n\\nHe went solo in the early 1950\\'s, and had an R&B hit with \"I Didn\\'t Sleep a Wink Last Night,\" and was oft found performing on the road with his saxophonist brother Red Prysock.  Tracks like \"I Worry \\'Bout You\" in 1958,  \"The Very Thought of You\" in 1960, and 1965\\'s \"It\\'s Too Late Baby, It\\'s Too Late\"  were hits on the Old Town label.  Old Town, became his home through much of the late 50\\'s & early 60\\'s and again through the 70\\'s after a brief late 60\\'s stint with Verve. \\n\\nWith his concert popularity building, Verve picked him up, and paired him with Count Basie for an album in 1965, and after years of one-nighters on the Chitlin circuit, he finally performed at Carnegie Hall in 1966. Many productions from the 60\\'s & 70\\'s place Prysock in baths of syrupy strings & over orchestrated arrangements that have woefully buried his voice. He remains largely under appreciated as an \\'easy listening\\' artist by modern audiences, with the Verve Music Group not even bothering to provide a bio on their website, despite selling his recordings. \\n\\nIn the 70s, he kept recording for Old Town, and had smatterings of success like the circa \\'73 Northern Soul In The Rain fave and a surprise disco hit with \"When Love Is New\". By 1980 \"I\\'m Never Gonna Let You Go\" was recorded for Gamble & Huff\\'s Philadelphia International label . In 1985, recorded his first new album in almost a decade,signing with Milestone Records in 1986. He continued recording jazz ballads & blues for Milestone, accompanied by his brother Red Prysock.  His Milestone recordings were considered comebacks and “A Rockin’ Good Way,” (’85) and its follow up, “This Guy’s in Love with You,” (’86) rekindled his career, and he received 2 Grammy nomination for his latter career efforts, one a duet with Betty Joplin. His last studio effort was released in 1987, and a collection of his Milestone Recordings was re-issued in 2000 via the Concord Music Group. Prysock received a Pioneer Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in 1995 and passed away in 1997 after suffering an aneurysm at age 73 in Bermuda where he had a retirement residence.\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Arthur+Prysock\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Ashanti (born Ashanti Shequoiya Douglas on October 13, 1980 in Glen Cove, New York, United States), is a Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter, record producer, actress, model & fashion designer who has been performing since 2000.\\n\\nAshanti is most famous for her eponymous Grammy Award-winning debut album Ashanti which featured the hit song Foolish. The album set a Soundscan record as the most albums sold by any first-time female artist in the chart\\'s history, outselling debuts by Alicia Keys and Lauryn Hill. Later that year, she was acclaimed as the \"Princess of Hip-Hop & R&B\" by the media and capped off her successful debut by winning eight Billboard awards and two American Music Awards. \\n\\nAshanti cites Mary J. Blige and  Ella Fitzgerald as her musical influences. Praised as a gifted songwriter by her peers and critics alike, Ashanti has written/co-written the bulk of all her music. She is currently an independent artist on her own record label entitled Written Entertainment.\\n\\nIt was when she was noticed by Murder Inc. mastermind Irv Gotti that Ashanti began to blossom. Gotti noted her dancing and acting abilities in addition to her vocal skills. In 2001, Ashanti was first featured as a background vocalist on rapper Big Pun\\'s song How We Roll. In the same year, Ashanti was featured on fellow labelmate Caddillac Tah\\'s singles Pov City Anthem and Just Like A Thug. She also appeared on the 2001 The Fast and the Furious soundtrack as a featured artist on Vita\\'s 2001 hip hop remake of Madonna\\'s Justify My Love and on the solo track When a Man Does Wrong. She appeared as a background vocalist on I\\'m Real (Murder Remix), a collaboration by labelmate Ja Rule and Jennifer Lopez (she also appeared in the music video for Ain\\'t It Funny (Murder Remix), the 2nd duet between Lopez & Rule), and was featured on Fat Joe\\'s What\\'s Luv? and Ja Rule\\'s Always on Time. What\\'s Luv? and Always on Time were released simultaneously and became two of the biggest hit songs of 2002. Ashanti became the first female to occupy the top two positions on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart when Always on Time and What\\'s Luv? were number-one and number-two respectively.\\n\\nFollowing the success of her collaborations with Ja Rule and Fat Joe, Ashanti released her debut single, Foolish, which contained a sample of the 1983 song Stay With Me by DeBarge (also utilized by Notorious B.I.G. in his 1995 hit One More Chance). She became the second artist (after the The Beatles) to have their first three chart entries in the top ten of the Hot 100 simultaneously. Ashanti\\'s self-titled debut album, Ashanti, was released on Irv Gotti\\'s Murder Inc. record label in April 2002. It debuted at number-one on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart, selling over 503,000 copies in its first week (the most successful first week sales for a debut R&B female artist up through that point--record later broken by Mary J. Blige\\'s The Breakthrough). The album has been certified 3x platinum in the U.S and platinum (300,000 copies) in the UK. The album has sold over 6.5 million copies worldwide. Ashanti penned all 12 songs on the album, most written on-the-spot in the studio.\\n\\nAshanti\\'s follow-up singles, Happy and Baby, were not as successful as her debut single but did peak in the top ten and top twenty in the U.S. respectively. During the summer of 2002, Ashanti appeared on Ja Rule\\'s Down 4 U with labelmates, female rappers Vita and Charli Baltimore. The song appeared on a Murder Inc. compilation titled Irv Gotti Presents The Inc. Ashanti\\'s debut album earned her many awards including eight Billboard Music Awards, two American Music Awards, a Lady of Soul Award for \"Aretha Franklin Entertainer of the Year,\" and a Grammy Award.\\n\\nIn July 2003, Ashanti released her second album, Chapter II, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with first week sales of 326,000 copies in the U.S.. The album went Platinum, selling 1.5 million copies in U.S. The album\\'s success was somewhat eclipsed, however, by all the negative drama surrounding the Murder Inc. camp at the time (i.e., the FBI investigation and the G-Unit feuding). Chapter II\\'s first single, Rock wit U (Awww Baby), became a hit, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. Its video, which showed Ashanti in a bikini frolicking on a beach and riding an elephant named Bubbles, was nominated for two 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. A remix of the song contains interpolations of Michael Jackson\\'s Rock with You. The second single, Rain on Me, reached the number-seven spot on the Hot 100 and number two on the Hot 100 R&B Songs chart. Chapter II was nominated for a 2004 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album, and Rock wit U (Awww Baby) and Rain on Me were nominated in the categories of Best R&B Song and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, respectively. At the end of 2003 in November, Ashanti performed at The American Music Awards and was nominated in two categories.\\n\\nIn November 2003, Ashanti\\'s Christmas album, Ashanti\\'s Christmas was released. The album containing 10 Christmas songs, six classic covers and four she wrote herself. To coincide with the release Ashanti premiered a Christmas Medley video for the album. While on BET\\'s 106 & Park, Ashanti said the concept of the Christmas Album came from a guest spot she did on Steve Harvey\\'s radio show. While playing a game with Stevie Wonder, he began playing Christmas medleys on the piano and Ashanti began singing them, giving her label head the idea to push for a Christmas Album. Ashanti went into the studio to record the album during the summer of 2003. According to soundscan, the album sold just around 100,000 units in the U.S.\\n\\nBefore Concrete Rose was released, Ashanti did some major promotion for her single Only U, when she premiered it at the 2004 Vibe Music Awards. In 2004, Ashanti was invited back to perform at VH1\\'s Divas 2004. She appeared on stage with Patti LaBelle, Gladys Knight, Jessica Simpson, and others. She performed Diana Ross\\' single \"I\\'m Coming Out\", and she performed a soul-influenced rendition of Chaka Khan\\'s funk driven \"Ain\\'t Nobody. Later that year Ashanti collaborated with male R&B newcomer and labelmate Lloyd on the song Southside, which was released as his debut single and was a moderate hit. Wonderful—with Ja Rule and R. Kelly—peaked at number five in the U.S. and at number one in the UK, and Jimmy Choo with rapper Shyne reached number fifty-five on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart. Alongside artist such as Wyclef Jean, Mary J. Blige, Eve, Brandy, Fabolous, Jadakiss, Missy Elliott, and many others, Ashanti participated in a cover of \"Wake Up Everybody\" in support of ACT, the left-leaning political action committee.\\n\\nIn December 2004, Ashanti released her third studio album, Concrete Rose, the title of which took on Tupac Shakur\\'s pseudonym \"The Rose That Grew from Concrete\". The album debuted at number seven in the U.S with first week sales of 254,000 copies, and eventually became her third platinum certified album; according to Nielsen SoundScan, it has sold 871,000 copies. The first single, the gold-certified Only U, reached number thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100 and became her biggest hit in the United Kingdom, peaking at number two. A second single, the ballad Don\\'t Let Them, garnered little chart success after Def Jam refused to fund a music video due to Irv Gotti\\'s legal troubles during his money laundering trial. Ashanti used her own money to deliver the second video to her fans, with Gotti acting as director. The single was released only in the U.S., where it failed to chart, and the UK, where it reached the lower end of the top forty. In 2005, Ashanti graced the stage at the MTV Japan Music Awards, where she performed her hit single, Only U. She also won a Style award during the show. She performed alongside huge acts like Mariah Carey and Korean star Rain.\\n\\nIn December 2005, Ashanti released a remix album of Concrete Rose titled Collectables by Ashanti. It features six remixes of previously released tracks and four newly recorded songs, including the single Still on It, which features rappers Paul Wall and Method Man. The album was an opportunity for her to fulfill her contract with Def Jam (and have the option of working with another label), and did not fare well on the charts.\\n\\nHer fourth studio album, The Declaration, was released on June 3, 2008. Ashanti ventured out and acquired producers and collaborators primarily outside The Inc. for the first time. She said the album was a representation of the freedom she felt she had at that time in her career. \"I\\'m steering my own ship and taking the lead on everything. You can definitely hear the growth; I\\'m working with producers I\\'ve never worked with before\". Irv Gotti was quoted as saying, \"she\\'s having her little Janet Jackson Control moment. Every artist has their moment when they feel they need to take over their own music and this is hers\".\\n\\nThe album debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 with sales of 86,000 copies, Ashanti\\'s lowest first-week sales for a studio album. As of September 2008, The Declaration had sold 230,000 copies in the U.S., according to Nielsen SoundScan.

Simpson, who is the younger sister of pop singer Jessica Simpson, rose to prominence in mid-2004 through the success of her number-one debut album Autobiography and the accompanying reality series The Ashlee Simpson Show. Simpson received widespread criticism when she used a pre-recorded vocal track on Saturday Night Live in October 2004. Following a North American concert tour and a film appearance, Simpson released a second number-one album, I Am Me, in October 2005. Her third album, Bittersweet World, was released in April 2008.\\n\\nHer breakout came with her debut single, \"Pieces of Me\", which was released in 2004, became a top-five hit in the United States, and topped the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart based on radio airplay. The success of the single and her reality show helped propel her debut album, Autobiography, also released in 2004, to the top of the Billboard 200 albums chart. The project sold over five million copies worldwide, making it her most successful album to date. Simpson had a leading role in the film Undiscovered (2005), which became a critical and commercial flop. The failure of the film, along with multiple critically panned performances, led to media scrutiny.

The album went on to receive a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\\n\\nFollowing her appearance as Roxie Hart in the West End production of Chicago, Simpson announced that she had begun working on her third studio album. The album differed from the pop-rock sound of her previous efforts, featuring a dance-pop and 1980s-themed sound. Bittersweet World was released in 2008 with positive critical reception, but it saw a decline in sales. The effort reached number 4 on the Billboard 200. The following year, Simpson joined the main cast of the Melrose Place revamp, which was met with harsh critical reception. Later that year, she made her Broadway debut reprising her role as Roxie Hart in Chicago on Broadway.\\n\\nSimpson announced a fourth studio album that same year. She independently released the single \"Bat for a Heart\", though it failed to have success. Simpson eventually scrapped the album and focused on her child. Simpson reprised her role as Roxie Hart for the third time in a 2-dates special production in Hollywood Bowl in July 2013 directed by Brooke Shields. In October, Simpson and her husband Evan Ross released their debut EP by Ashlee + Evan through Access Records, which was supported by a tour in select cities across North America, and their TV reality show.\\n\\nShe was married to musician Pete Wentz from 2008 to 2011.

       " 'Doc Gynéco (real name Bruno Beausir) launched his career at the age of 19, writing a few tracks for the hardcore rap group Ministère AMER. After this rap group parted, Virgin Records signed him with the intent of converting his demos into an album in Paris.\\nThis project partially fell through, due to the mediocrity of the resulting work; Doc Gyneco then agreed to leave for Los Angeles to work with a famous American producer, Ken Kessie. The result of this work would be \"Première Consultation\", released in 1996, which received large media praise and huge success both in France and the world. Singles from the album include \"Est-ce que ça le fait?\", \"Viens voir le docteur\", \"Dans Ma Rue\", \"Passements de Jambes\", and \"Né Ici\".\\nTwo years later on the December 1st of 1998 his second album appeared in the shops, entitled \"Liaisons Dangereuses\". Although the main single -- \"C\\'est Beau La Vie\" -- created with the help of a politician (Bernard Tapie) was a flop, the album still sold reasonably well and earned its author even more notoriety.\\nIn the spring of 2001, Doc Gynéco tried to come back at the front of the music scene after a few years of silence with his third creation \"Quality Street\" . The single \"Caramel\", the first release from this new album met little success; yet guest stars on the album include the Wu-Tang Clan and Gregory Isaac.\\nIn August of 2002, the 4th album called \"Solitaire\" came out.

Doc Gyneco was criticized for \\'selling out\\', making this album out of a need for money.

       " 'Heitor Villa-Lobos (March 5, 1887 —  November 17, 1959) was a pioneering Brazilian modernist composer. He penned twelve symphonies, four operas, five ballets, and one of the most important string quartet cycles of the twentieth century. His music is noted for its exotic sound palette and formal inventiveness, influenced both by Brazilian folk music and stylistic elements from the European classical tradition.\\n\\nVilla-Lobos was born in Rio de Janeiro. After his father died, he earned a living for his family by playing in cinema orchestras and street bands in Rio. As a cellist in an opera company, he made early attempts at composing grand opera. Encouraged by Arthur Napoleão, a pianist and music publisher, he decided to compose seriously.\\n\\nFrom 1905 Villa-Lobos began exploring Brazil\\'s interior in a series of expeditions that exposed him to native Brazilian musical culture. Though serious doubt has been cast on some of his tales from this decade of travel - about his capture and near escape from cannibals, for instance - his experiences turned him off the idea of conventional compositional training and rendered him a lifelong advocate of nationalist themes in Brazilian classical music.\\n\\nEuropean influences were still vital to his development. A 1917 tour by the Ballets Russes left a strong impact. That year Villa-Lobos also met the French composer Darius Milhaud, who was in Rio as secretary to Paul Claudel at the French Legation. Milhaud brought the music of Debussy, Satie, and possibly Stravinsky; in return Villa-Lobos introduced Milhaud to Brazilian street music. In 1918, Villa-Lobos also met the pianist Artur Rubinstein, who became a lifelong friend and champion; this meeting prompted Villa-Lobos to write more piano music. In the mid to late 1920s, Villa-Lobos gained significant recognition in Paris, where he also met Varèse, Picasso, Stokowski and Copland. Pieces from this period include the Chôros, a sequence of chamber and orchestral pieces based around melodic kernels of street music.\\n\\nIn the 1930s, Villa-Lobos turned propagandist for the Vargas era, writing patriotic songs for schools and civic occasions. He was the chair of a committee whose task was to arrange a definitive version of the Brazilian national anthem. But he was also working on his now widely-played Bachianas Brasileiras - less radical statements of Brazilian folk style built around the musical templates of J.S. Bach.\\n\\nAfter the end of Vargas and the Second World War, Villa-Lobos received a huge number of commissions, and fulfilled many of them despite failing health. He composed concertos for piano, cello (the second one in 1953), classical guitar (in 1951), harp (in 1953) and harmonica (in 1955–6). Other commissions included his Symphony No.11 (for the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1955), and the opera Yerma (1955–56) based on the play by Federico García Lorca. His prolific output prompted criticisms of note spinning and banality: critical reactions to his Piano Concerto No. 5 included the comments \"bankrupt\" and \"a piano tuners\\' orgy\". Yet the period also saw the composition of the important late string quartets - seventeen were completed, with one unfinished. In June 1959, Villa-Lobos alienated many of his fellow musicians by expressing his disillusionment with Brazilian cultural life, saying in an interview that Brazil was \"dominated by mediocrity\". In November he died in Rio; his state funeral was the final major civic event in that city before the capital transferred to Brasília. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Heitor+Villa-Lobos\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Ever have that distinct feeling of deja vu, but just can\\'t seem to put your finger on where you\\'ve met before? You\\'re positively sure you\\'ve heard the voice. Most of us are even familiar with the name. Yet by the time the majority of us fully experience The Art Of A Woman, the solo debut by singer/songwriter/producer ATHENA CAGE, we\\'ll be left wondering why we haven\\'t heard more of this crystal-clear, keenly melodic and spirited voice. Bringing forth an overall bright and contemporary Pop/R&B sound, ATHENA breaths new life into new millennium urban music with sharp melodies, lively and warm production, put across with an upbeat and optimistic attitude. \\n\\nIn ATHENA\\'s world, there\\'s no more brooding over lost loves, working through dramatic break-ups or letting relationship woes get you down. Instead, through the lyrics that comprise her stunningly infectious debut disc, ATHENA chooses to put a more optimistic spin on matters of the heart. \"I\\'d like people to know through my music that relationships that don\\'t work, don\\'t necessarily have to be negative,\" she conveys. \"You can take something positive from every experience and move forth. You can always use the lesson for your next experience, so that you don\\'t make the same mistake.\" Drawing on both personal experiences and those of people around her, ATHENA takes a detour from the sassy, attitude-laced \"battle of the sexes\" message that has been prominent in recent Pop/R&B sounds, opting instead to co-write songs for her solo debut that tell \"positive stories.\"\\n\\nAsked why she chose the title The Art of A Woman, ATHENA responded, \"Music is art. Just as a painter uses his brush to paint pictures, a singer uses her voice to sing songs. So I look at each of my songs as a painting. The songs on my CD represent a collection of my art, thus, The Art of A Woman. I don\\'t know what the critics will say, because my art, if you will, represents a diversity of genres. Some may say it\\'s risky. But I trust music lovers and hope there\\'s something for everyone.\"\\n\\nWhat you hear from ATHENA on The Art Of A Woman has an ultimately refreshing tone. Unlike your run of the mill Pop/R&B diva, ATHENA was intimately involved both in the songwriting and recording process, having co-wrote and co-produced nearly every song on the album, including the first single \"Hey Hey,\" a funky club jam on which she shares a writing and production credit. \"I\\'m also very proud of the fact that most of the album was recorded with live instruments,\" explains Athena. \"Live strings, horns, guitars, piano and percussion. You won\\'t find a single sample on the entire album.\"\\n\\nWith production by such sonic superstars as Rodney Jerkins, with whom she co-wrote the confident and empowering \"All I Need Is Me,\" a track Jerkins produced with a brand new twist on his million dollar sound, Damon Elliot (Destiny\\'s Child) and Steve Rhythm (Pink), ATHENA presents herself as that modern-day young woman who wants the truth -- no matter how much it initially hurts. \\n\\nOn the lush, easy-paced track \"Let Me Know,\" as her sugar-kissed, multi-layered vocals assure, \"I\\'ll be fine all by myself/It won\\'t be hard to find someone else.\" Continuing the legacy of women demanding their props, her sexy, yet assertive \"Respect\" can\\'t help but seep into your subconscious with its steady-driving, mid-tempo rhythm, while even a bit of hip-hop makes the mix amidst the slick \\'n\\' shifty glide of \"Make You Really Wanna.\"\\n\\nYet you\\'ll find her approach to more delicate material just as enthralling. While ATHENA feels that the very personal \"Dream Lover\" is \"just absolutely beautiful,\" her on-point sense of melody propels the smooth-groovin\\', Pop/R&B beat balladry of \"Take It Out On Me.\" In a more soul-baring mode, she turns in the nearly angelic, honey-coated profession of love with \"You,\" while \"Until You Come Back To Me,\" with its live string arrangement, and one of ATHENA\\'s favorites, lays it all on the line in the most tender of ways. \\n\\nATHENA also found time in between writing and recording her solo debut to record the pivotal track for Paramount Pictures/MTV Films #1 release \"Save The Last Dance.\" Entitled \"All or Nothing (Live Your Dreams),\" the song is a catchy, up-tempo number included on the movie\\'s accompanying soundtrack. The hugely successful soundtrack is the third consecutive platinum album on which ATHENA has appeared. Her previous two were with her frequent collaborator, Keith Sweat. \\n\\nGiven her track record, it\\'s no small wonder how she managed such a way with a song. For as far back as she can recall, her Kentucky upbringing was filled with a variety of influences, listening to everything from Shirley Caesar, The Winans and Whitney Houston to Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Dionne Warwick and even Shania Twain. \"I just got into listening to everything,\" she fondly recollects. \"Ever since I can recall, I knew that this was the business for me; I just wanted to be a singer as far back as like eight or nine years-old. I remember barricading myself in my room, just listening to the radio all day long. It was in my blood; I just knew from the beginning -- without a doubt -- that this is what I wanted to do.\" \\n\\nThough she\\'d always envisioned herself as a solo singer, steadfast determination found her signed to platinum-selling r&b singer Keith Sweat\\'s Elektra-distributed Keia Records, as a member of girl group Kut Klose. \"Kut Klose allowed me to get my feet wet, and see what this business is like,\" is how she sums the group experience. Though they created quite a buzz with their Surrender LP and \"I Like\" single, ATHENA would enjoy even greater chart success and notoriety with \"Get Up On It\" and the unforgettable \"Nobody,\" her Number One, multi-platinum, hit duet with Keith Sweat. In 1998, ATHENA was honored with the prestigious BMI pop Song of the Year award for co-writing \"Twisted\" with Keith Sweat. \"Twisted\" was one of the most successful singles of the previous year. The resulting momentum created by her chart success would find her spending nearly two years on the road, touring non-stop. \\n\\nResisting the big-city lure of music industry capitals like New York and Los Angeles, ATHENA decided to return to her native Kentucky, where she spends much of her free time writing songs. \"This is the part of the country that was basically forgotten in terms of music,\" ATHENA says. \"You think of New York, L.A. and Atlanta, but no one really thinks about what kind of talent is in Kentucky. So, I wanted to come back and base my music companies here in Bowling Green to take advantage of the wealth of musical talent in the area. Another reason is that I enjoy the peacefulness and being around my family. To me, these are the things that keep you grounded. Plus, when I\\'m home, I\\'m a bit more introspective. I really dig deep into myself and come up with song ideas.\" Thus, while she concentrated on the creative, her management team took care of handling the business end. \"I knew I wanted to make the transition into being a solo artist,\" confides ATHENA, \"so my management was negotiating with a few companies.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the old adage goes, \"For those who wait, good things do come.\" For ATHENA, that \"good thing\" would be a solo recording contract with Priority Records, that \"right situation\" she\\'d held out for. For lovers of fresh-feeling contemporary pop and r&b music for the new millennium, that \"good thing\" comes in the form of The Art Of A Woman. Ecstatic over the prospects of her long-anticipated solo career, ATHENA enthuses, \"I just wanted my debut album to be all me, and basically, I\\'ve achieved that. In my estimation, we\\'ve got a lot of great songs. I\\'m very excited over how things are going. You could say I\\'m positive and upbeat about life, the long and short of it.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Athena+Cage\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'With the love and hustle of the Crescent City running through his veins, August is eager to follow in the footsteps of the NOLA music legends that paved his way. His recently inked deal Def Jam Recordings looks to be a great step in the right direction, but music wasn’t always in his future. \\n\\nAugust learned at an early age that drugs and money could make you, or break you. With both his father and stepfather battling crack addiction, August’s mother moved their family to Houston, Texas in search of a fresh start. But Houston provided no happy ending. For years, a young August endured a home life plagued by drugs and violence. At just 14, he got word from New Orleans that is father, August Sr., lost his battle with drugs and alcohol. \\n\\nIn an attempt to escape his reality, August took to Youtube, where he posted dozens of homemade performance videos. His clips covering the likes of Musiq Soulchild and Lyfe Jennings went viral, generating millions of views in just over a month. It seemed that he was finally taking his first steps toward a bright future in music, but just a year later, reality hit home when his best friend was shot and killed in the streets of Houston. As quickly as August appeared, he vanished form Youtube, back to the real world. With tensions mounting, 16-year-old August was kicked out of his mother’s home. Alone, he returned to New Orleans. He bounced around between family and friends houses, but on some nights, only the corner store provided him shelter. Eventually, he took to the streets, selling drugs as a means of survival.\\n\\nWith his older brother also in the streets hustling, it wouldn’t be long before August learned that the addiction to money could be just as deadly as the addiction to drugs. Just days before August’s 18th birthday, his older brother was gunned down in New Orleans East, another unsolved murder in one of the nations most dangerous cities. “I never expected them [the police] to find his killer”, August explains. “People die everyday in the streets of New Orleans. Unfortunately, death has become a way of life,” but not for August. His brother’s death became his motivation to not become a statistic, but to pursue his musical aspirations on an entirely new level.\\n\\nUnder the guidance of NNTME MuCo, AKA Noontime, (management/production company), August relocated to Atlanta in 2011 to begin carving his own musical path, creating music in a lane that would separate him from his R&B counterparts. His experiences in life are what shaped him, so those experiences, no matter how brutally honest, positive or negative, would serve as the focal point of his artistry. In April of 2012 August teamed up with Hoodrich/MMG’s own DJ Scream for the release of his debut mixtape, ‘The Product’, which garnered him an internet and radio buzz, and spawned the Sound Mob produced single, “Sucka” featuring fellow New Orleans native, R&B crooner Lloyd. The anti-love track offers the opinion that “love is for suckas”, providing an alternative to the sappy love songs associated with today’s R&B.\\n\\nThis past May, Alsina returned with his second installment of ‘The Product‘ series, this time teaming up with DJ Drama and his Gangsta Grillz brand. The debut single “I Luv This Shit” finds August paired with fellow Def Jam label mate, Trinidad Jame$. The top 10 hit, produced by Knucklehead, speaks to the rebellious and, sometimes, reckless lifestyle that finds August singing words that many can relate to, “I’m way too drunk to be talking like this, I’m way too high to be trippin like this, I’m way too young to be livin like this, ask me why I do it I’ma put it like this... God Damn it, I luv it”. It’s that honest and rebellious tone that caught the ear of Cash Money CEO/Rich Gang boss, Birdman, who jumped on the remix to stamp the fellow New Orleans native.\\n\\nWith his buzz building, August’s next stamp would come from media giant MTV, as he was named one of 2013’s Fab 5, their annual list of hip-hop artist to watch. Exposure on the network helped to make his independent video “Downtown” ft. Kidd Kidd, a viral hit, generating nearly 1 million views in less than 2 months. The autobiographical song/visual would become the title track for Alsina’s first official NNTME/Radio Killa/Def Jam release, an 8-song EP titled, ‘Downtown: Life Under the Gun’, which offers collaborations between Alsina and the previously mentioned Jame$ & Kidd Kidd, along with NOLA veteran Curren$y, and Atlanta newcomer Rich Homie Quan. Of the EP, Alsina says, “It allows you to walk through my hood with me and see where I’m from. Don’t get it confused, this isn’t my album, just a few songs to let people know what I’m about and why I do this”. \\n\\nWhile just 21 years old, and already a lifetime of experiences behind him, August Alsina is living proof that your past doesn’t have to dictate your future, and that life’s hardships can be the motivation required for success.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/August+Alsina\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Austin Mahone may have discovered music the old-fashioned way, but his rise to stardom has been undeniably cutting-edge. Begging his mom for a drum set at 6 years-old, he caught the proverbial \"bug\" after roaming around a local La Vernia, TX music store. Luckily, the drums ended up under the Christmas tree that year. Fast forward to 2010, Mahone started uploading covers of everyone from Drake and Justin Bieber to Ne-Yo and Bruno Mars to his YouTube page, and a massive following began to organically amass.\\n\\n  \"I\\'d either check Billboard or iTunes Top 10 for the hottest songs, and I\\'d record my own versions,\" the 16 year-old explains. \"That\\'s how people began to find me online.\"\\nThey found him in droves too.

By 2012, he\\'d garnered 1.8 million Facebook fans, 1.5 million Twitter followers, 545k YouTube subscribers, and notched over 96 million views without a record label, marketing team, or any standard industry machinery. After quickly selling 100k downloads of his infectious song \"11:11\" independently, he had become a veritable phenomenon. However, he could back everything up on stage too. Selling out high-profile shows at the Best Buy Theater Times Square in New York and Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles, he landed on Live! With Kelly & Michael, Entertainment Tonight, Access Hollywood, E! News and VH1, while appearing in The Wall Street Journal, The Hollywood Reporter, and more. \\n\\n  Everything is set to change again with the release of his forthcoming full-length debut for Chase Records and Republic Records. The first official single, \"Say You\\'re Just a Friend\" featuring Flo Rida, updates the Biz Markie classic with a fiery, fresh, and fun little twist. Mahone\\'s impressive vocal delivery pulsates over a big dance floor groove just before Flo Rida drops a sizzling verse. It\\'s an immediately irresistible anthem.\\n\\n  \"I want to make upbeat pop that you can party to,\" says Mahone. \"I\\'ve always been a huge fan of Flo Rida, and I thought it\\'d be cool to get him on this track. It\\'s about being friends with a girl that you like more than just a friend. You can\\'t tell her though because it might ruin that friendship. It\\'s something a lot of people can relate to. We had a blast with it though.\"\\nWith a 2013 tour with Taylor Swift on the horizon and more music coming, everybody is about to have a blast along with Mahone though—especially the countless \"Mahomies\" worldwide who have fallen for him.  \"I hope everyone can connect with the songs and love them,\" he concludes. \"I want to make music that people can listen to over and over again and feel good about.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Austin+Mahone\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'There are two artists of this name: an Israeli jazz bassist and an Israeli jazz trumpet player Avishai E. Cohen.\\n\\n1. Avishai Cohen (born 1970 in Jerusalem) is an Israeli jazz bassist, composer and arranger. He was raised by a musical family, and as a child he started playing piano. After a few years he moved to the bass guitar. Later, after playing in the army for a while, he moved to New York City. After performing some small clubs, he was noticed by Chick Corea and was given a record contract. He has performed in two of Chick Corea\\'s bands, \"Origin\" and the \"Chick Corea New Trio\".\\n\\nAfter having recorded \"Adama\" in 1997 and \"Colors\" three years later, Avishai decided to create his own label in 2003. The label released its debut CD, \"Lyla\" in September 2003. In February of 2005 Razdaz Recordz released \"At Home\", an album that was arguably Avishai Cohen\\'s most compelling and striking new recording to date.\\n \\nThat is until the artist conceived of, and recorded his newest studio CD, the spectacularly beautiful, \"Continuo\". Cohen’s third recording on his label Razdaz Recordz, and his seventh as a leader, was recorded in Gothenburg, Sweden in December 2005 with Avishai\\'s core trio of pianist/keyboardist Sam Barsh and drummer/percussionist Mark Guiliana.\\n\\nNew album \"Gently Disturbed\" released in 2008 performed by Avishai\\'s trio. Avishai also shows more of his \"Avishai Cohen & Ensemble\" on their world tour.\\n\\n\\n2. Avishai E. Cohen - trumpet player, who received the Clark Terry award. He recorded under his own name, with his brother and sister as the \\'3 Cohens\\', and with \\'Third World Love\\'. Bio excerpt from his website (http://www.avishaicohenmusic.com/):\\nAlbums under his own name are The Trumpet Player   &   After the Big Rain   &   Triveni II \\n\\nAvishai Cohen is a leading figure on the international jazz scene and one of the most sought-after players of his generation — “an assertive and accomplished trumpeter with a taste for modernism,” according to Nate Chinen of The New York Times. Though deeply rooted in the bebop and post-bop tradition, Avishai is taking jazz in new directions, making waves as an improviser, composer and bandleader. Originally from Tel Aviv, he began performing at age 10. He toured the world with the Young Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra and went on to become the trumpet player of choice for many leading jazz, rock, pop, studio and television projects. He received a full scholarship to attend the Berklee College of Music in Boston, and in 1997 he placed third in the prestigious Thelonious Monk Jazz Trumpet Competition.\\n\\nAvishai came of age as part of the fertile scene at Smalls, the storied New York jazz club, where he developed his artistic vision alongside such friends and colleagues as pianist Jason Lindner, bassist Omer Avital and vocalist Claudia Acuña. Here the imperatives of jazz tradition and innovation were not in conflict, but rather merged into one powerful creative stream. Avishai flourished in an environment where hard-driving swing, open-ended funk, Latin and Middle Eastern rhythms, complex extended forms and free improvisation converged under one roof, drawing enthusiastic audiences. All of Avishai’s diverse work, as a leader, co-leader and sideman, is informed by this broad-minded legacy, which has given jazz new vitality and relevance in the 21st century.\\n\\nAvishai made his debut as a leader in 2003 with The Trumpet Player, a burning straightahead session with bassist John Sullivan (Roy Haynes), drummer Jeff Ballard (Chick Corea, Pat Metheny) and special guest Joel Frahm on tenor. His second album, After the Big Rain, is the last part of “The Big Rain Trilogy,” a series of recordings that is now nearing completion. The trilogy also includes Before the Big Rain (part one), a large-group outing, and The Big Rain (part two), a trio encounter with Yonatan Avishai on piano and Daniel Freedman on percussion. Avishai’s music is alternately moody and joyous, richly atmospheric yet beat-driven and grooving, suffused with compositional depth, inspired improvisation and a profound world-music influence. Avishai plays open and muted trumpet but also routes his horn through electronic effects that range from the dreamy to the snarling and distorted. He’s been developing these sounds over the course of the last decade. “When I play effects, I play a different instrument,” he says. “The whole concept changes.” \\n\\nAvishai’s other credits range from touring with the celebrated French-American singer-songwriter Keren Ann, to sharing the stage with the great Bobby Hutcherson in the all-star San Francisco Jazz Collective. In addition, Avishai is the co-leader of Third World Love, with Omer Avital, drummer Daniel Freedman and pianist Yonatan Avishai, a group with four recordings to its credit. He also leads a funk-oriented band with bassist Me’shell Ndegeocello and drummer Adam Deitch, and continues to perform extensively with the 3 Cohens, which he formed with his sister Anat and brother Yuval, both gifted reeds players. With his incredible instrumental skill and world-spanning musical interests, Avishai, in the words of critic Ben Ratliff, “has all the power and tenacity he’s going to need.\\n\\nAvishai is the chosen artist of Israel Cultural Excellence Foundation (IcExcellence) since 2004. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Avishai+Cohen\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Catapulted to overnight fame in the early 80s with his single \"Cargo de nuit\", Axel Bauer appears to have spent most of the last two decades struggling against the \\'one-hit wonder\\' syndrome. Axel finally managed to shake off his \"Cargo de nuit\" image at the end of the 90s and his latest album proves his worth as a genuinely talented singer-songwriter.\\n\\nBorn in Paris on 7 April 1961, Axel Bauer grew up in a talented musical family, which included a classical concert pianist (his aunt) and a professional jazz musician (his father). Axel\\'s father honed his musical skills playing drums with Django Reinhardt and went on to work with the crème de la crème of the jazz world. Surrounded by music from an early age, Axel acquired an extensive musical culture and a passion for British and American groups.\\n\\nAxel took piano lessons as a child, but without any great enthusiasm. The instrument which was to prove the love of his life was the guitar. Throughout his teenage years the budding young musician spent considerably more time hanging out in local rock clubs than he did studying at his lycée. Nevertheless, Axel passed his baccalauréat with no trouble at all and went on to enrol at art school, where he developed another great passion in life, drawing.\\n\\nMusic won out over art in the end, however, and by the late 70s Axel had bought his first guitar and was spending most of his time playing chords and songwriting. Axel went on to trade his first guitar in for a Stratocaster while on a trip to Africa and this legendary make of guitar seemed to act as a lucky charm on his career.\\n\\nOn The Waterfront\\n\\nIn the early 80s Axel was introduced to the songwriter Michel Eli and the pair embarked upon successful songwriting collaboration together. In fact, it was one of their early numbers that launched Axel\\'s career.\\n\\nBy 1983 pop videos were all the rage on the French music scene and any artist who wanted to make their way in the world had to have an eye-catching video clip. Axel Bauer excelled in this department, enlisting the services of French video-maker and fashion photographer Jean-Baptiste Mondino. Taking inspiration from the movie \"Querelle de Brest\", Mondino shot an elegant 80s twist on the film classic in which Axel strode through the streets of a deserted French port dressed in a sexy polo neck, braces and cloth cap. Bauer\\'s single \"Cargo de nuit\" proved to be a huge hit with the French public and over the next few months half of France walked round singing \"Trente-cinq jours sans voir la terre / Pull rayé, mal rasé\" (35 days and still no sight of land/ Here I am on deck, unkempt and unshaven in my stripy sailor\\'s top).\\n\\n\"Cargo de nuit\" went on to sell a staggering 700,000 copies, catapulting Axel to fame within a few weeks of its release. This lightning rise to fame turned out to be more of a curse than a blessing, however. It was difficult enough for a 22-year-old singer to be thrust into the media spotlight, but Axel\\'s other problem was that he quickly became the victim of a \\'one-hit wonder\\' phenomenon, music fans associating his success with a well-tuned marketing machine rather than the good, honest slog of a singer-songwriter. What\\'s more, the look Mondino had created for Axel in his \"Querelle de Brest\" video soon became a subject of mockery.\\n\\nAxel attempted to repeat the success of \"Cargo de nuit\" with \"Phantasmes\", but his second single sold just 200,000 and sales of his third single, \"Jessy\", plummeted to 60,000. In short, Axel\\'s fall from grace proved to be as rapid as his lightning rise to fame. One stroke of bad luck was followed by another and after his record company, Vogue, went bankrupt, Axel found himself totally abandoned by the French music industry.\\n\\nThe Exile Years\\n\\nFollowing this string of disappointments and disasters in France, Axel decided to re-locate to London in 1987. The wind of fortune changed for him once he had crossed the Channel, however, and after sending out a tentative demo tape Axel was offered a recording deal with EMI. (This was a major achievement in itself, for Axel was the first French artist to be signed by the label which had launched The Beatles).\\n\\nAxel concentrated on his live career from this point on, touring extensively throughout the UK. Five years after his first hit, he went on to bring out a debut album \"Les Nouveaux seigneurs\", which half-heartedly experimented with techno. But Axel failed to repeat his early success - \"Les Nouveaux seigneurs\" sold a mere 20,000 copies.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Axel had not been forgotten in France (although he seemed to be forever associated in most people\\'s minds with \"Cargo de nuit\" and his \"Querelle de Brest\" video). While the record-buying public failed to see beyond Axel\\'s public image, several French musicians recognised his talent. And when Axel returned to France in 1989 one of the first people to call him was Jean-Louis Aubert (the former lead singer of Téléphone), who invited him into the studio to work on his forthcoming album. Axel ended up guesting on two tracks on Aubert\\'s album, \"Bleu Blanc Vert\".\\n\\nEncouraged by the fact that he had not been forgotten on the French music scene, Axel, by now in his thirties, returned to the studio. In 1990 he released a second album entitled \"Sentinelles\" (which many people actually took to be his first). Apart from several songs penned by Axel himself, \"Sentinelles\" featured tracks written by a host of well-known French songwriters including Boris Bergman, Catherine Ringer (from Rita Mitsouko), Jean-Louis Aubert and Christine Lidon.\\n\\nThis second album, a combination of rock, guitar riffs and romantic ballads, appeared to be much better-suited to Axel\\'s personality and, although \"Sentinelles\" failed to score a huge hit with French music critics, it did produce one chart-topping single, \"Eteins la lumière\". This melodic electric guitar ballad (written and composed by Bauer himself), proved that a genuinely talented musician lay beneath the one-hit wonder image of \"Cargo de nuit\".\\n\\nFollowing the success of the single, Axel Bauer embarked upon an extensive two-month French tour (October – November 1990), bringing the house down when he performed at l\\'Elysée Montmartre in Paris on October 25th.\\n\\nThe Travelling Life\\n\\nAxel gradually began to shake off his \"Cargo de nuit\" image, but inventing a new persona in the French public\\'s mind proved to be a long and arduous image. Keen to stay out of the showbiz spotlight the second time round, Axel decided to go off travelling for a while and shortly after his \"Sentinelles\" tour he disappeared into the Sahara, going off to live with the Touareg community for several months. When he returned from his adventures in the desert, he went off to live in the French countryside where he took up his songwriting activities once again.\\n\\nAxel spent most of his three years in the countryside working on material for a new album, entitled \"Simple mortel\". Mixed and produced by UK studio wizard Steve Forward, this album featured a return to 70s-style rock and brought Axel\\'s descant vocals to the fore. Released in March \\'98, \"Simple mortel\" got an enthusiastic reception in the French media but failed to produce a chart-topping single.\\n\\nAxel appeared satisfied with his new album however and, after taking time off to spend with his girlfriend and new-born baby, he set off on tour again in 1999, appearing on the French club circuit with a three-piece backing band.\\n\\nIt had been a long uphill struggle for Axel to shake off \"Cargo de nuit\", but by the end of his 1999 tour he finally appeared to have done so. This break with the past left him free to embark upon new projects and in 2000, Axel re-surfaced on the French music scene with a new album entitled \"Achille\".\\n\\nAxel\\'s 11-track album featured a richer, fuller, more mature style and contributions from guest vocalists Miossec and Zazie (a long-term friend). Axel\\'s songwriting had come a long way since \"Cargo de nuit\" and he wrote much of the material on his new album himself. \"Achille\" also featured songs written by Juan Tamayo, Arnaud Giroux and his girlfriend Ilhem Kadid. Axel began touring his new album in December 2000 and brought the house down when he appeared in Paris, performing at La Scène (a \\'bar-restaurant\\' in Bastille) on January 23rd 2001.Axel returned to La Scène to play three concerts in May.\\n\\nGold disc\\n\\nAxel rocketed back to the top of the charts after \"A ma place\", a duet he recorded with Zazie, was released as a single at the start of the summer. The single went on to reach no.6 in the French singles chart in June. Following his new chart success, Axel kicked off a mini-tour in the autumn of 2001 with a concert in Paris at the Elysée Montmartre on 22 October. The concert, an absolute sell-out, featured guest appearances by a variety of artists including Zazie, Jean-Louis Aubert and the musicians from Parisian band Aston Villa. At the end of the tour Axel\\'s record company presented him with his first gold disc, after sales of his album (which had since been re-released with a new cover and a new title \"Personne n\\'est parfait\") topped the 100,000 mark.\\n\\nIn January 2002 the single \"A ma place\" went on to win the NRJ Music Award for Best Francophone Song of the Year. Following this new success Axel joined the Enfoirés tour, performing a series of fund-raising concerts for French charity \"Restaurants du Cœur\". Then on 12 February he continued his fund-raising activities for Survival (an organisation fighting to protect indigenous peoples). Later that month Florent Pagny released his new album, \"2\", which included a duet recorded with Bauer entitled \"Terre\".\\n\\nBauer remained busy with live concerts throughout the spring of 2002, performing a mini-tour which included an appearance in Francis Cabrel\\'s native village, Astaffort (near Toulouse) on 30 March.\\n\\nHaving reached the 20-year milestone in his career, 2003 seemed to be an appropriate year for Axel Bauer to release a greatest hits album. Needless to say \"La Désintégrale\", released in April of that year, included his biggest chart hit \"Cargo.\"\\n\\nA few months after the release of his greatest hits compilation, Axel was already hard at work writing material for a new album. He ended up composing the majority of the music for this new opus, which featured his usual mix of rock and mainstream sounds. Working in collaboration with producer Daniel Presley, Axel did try and move back towards his musical roots, however, keeping the overall sound on the album as raw and live as possible. A number of well-known songwriters contributed lyrics to the album including Ilhem Kahid, Pierre-Yves Lebert – who wrote the first single release \"Tu me tues\" (featuring music by Philippe Uminski) - Kemar (a former member of No One is Innocent) and Fred (from the  group Aston Villa). This musical \\'family\\' appeared to suit Axel Bauer down to the ground. His new album, \"Bad Cowboy\", would finally be released in April 2006.\\n\\nThe following month, Axel Bauer made a welcome return to the live circuit, performing a series of concerts across France.\\n\\n(excerpt from http://www.rfimusique.com/siteen/biographie/biographie_6249.asp) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Axel+Bauer\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Zazie (born Isabelle de Truchis de Varennes on 18 April 1964 in Boulogne-Billancourt) is a French singer and songwriter who also co-produces her own albums.\\n\\nZazie\\'s mother was an architect and her father a music teacher. Her songs range from upbeat rock or pop songs to languid downtempo tunes and are characterised by the wit of their lyrics based on puns, alliterations, homophones and double-entendres.\\n\\nZazie debuted in 1992 with the album \"Je Tu Ils\" and the single \"Sucré salé\".\\n\\nIn 1995, she released her sophomore album Zen, which was co-written and co-produced with Vincent-Marie Bouvot. It included the singles \"Zen\" and \"Homme Sweet Homme\". Her 1996 single \"Un point c\\'est toi\" from the same album was discussed on Canada\\'s MuchMusic TV program Too Much 4 Much due to its controversial content. Ultimately, the discussion panel deemed the video okay for audiences. In the video, a group of four smitten women, including Zazie, follow a pair of men down to a lake. There, the two men strip off their clothes and swim in the water. Zazie fantasizes about undressing one of the men and kissing him. To shock of the women, however, the two men kiss each other.\\nIn 1997, Pascal Obispo and Zazie released the single \"Les Meilleurs Ennemis\".\\n\\nHer 1998 album Made in Love was co-produced by Ali Staton, Pierre Jaconelli, and herself. The album photos were taken by fashion designer Jean-Baptiste Mondino. The songs \"Ça Fait Mal Et Ça Fait Rien\", \"Tous des anges\", and \"Tout Le Monde\" were released as singles. This album was followed by a live album, Made in Live, the next year. In 1999 she also wrote a song for Jane Birkin in Jane Birkin\\'s album .\\nIn 2001, Zazie dueted with Axel Bauer on the single \"A Ma Place\". It was her most successful single in France, reaching number four on the French charts.\\n\\nZazie once again addressed gay content on her 2002 single \"Adam et Yves\" from her 2001 album La Zizanie. This album was produced solely by Pierre Jaconelli. Other singles included \"Rue de la paix\" and \"Danse avec les loops\". In 2003, she released another live album, Ze Live.\\n\\nHer 2004 album Rodéo was co-produced and co-written with Jean-Pierre Pilot and Philippe Paradis. A short film \"Rodéo indien\" was made using songs from the album as a soundtrack. Zazie played the role of an Indian woman who leaves her cheating husband. She followed this album up with a live album, Rodéo Tour in 2006.\\n\\nIn  2007 her sixth studio album \"Totem\" was released and debuted at number 1. The second single (but first commercially released) was \"Je Suis Un Homme\" which became Zazie\\'s first solo top ten hit in France.

       " 'Axelle Red was born Fabienne Demal in Hasselt, Flanders, Belgium, on February 15, 1968. She is a singer-songwriter. Despite being Flemish, she chose to write and perform songs in the French language. She has achieved great critical success in both Belgium and France. Her musical style varies from jazz to piano ballads.\\n\\nBiography\\n\\nFabienne Demal, better known to European music fans as Axelle Red, was born in the north of Belgium, in the Flemish town of Hasselt, on February 15 1968. She was thus brought up in an environment where everyone spoke Dutch. But Axelle\\'s parents were both originally from Wallonia, the French-speaking part of Belgium, and at home they would speak to their daughter in French as well as Dutch. So Axelle grew up speaking both languages fluently. (This talent would serve the singer well in later life, for she was able to record her songs in Dutch as well as French and build up a strong following of fans across the whole of Belgium). Axelle\\'s parents would also encourage their daughter\\'s passion for music, introducing her to the sound of legendary American soul stars such as Aretha Franklin - a singer whom Axelle Red still cites as one of her greatest musical influences.\\n\\nAxelle\\'s passion for music intensified during her teenage years and, besides her love of soul music, she also became a committed Abba fan, learning all the Swedish supergroup\\'s hits by heart. The young teenager also devoted a great deal of time and energy to dance lessons.\\n\\nAxelle soon proved to have a powerful singing voice and, at the tender age of 15, she was spotted by a talent scout from a Belgian record company. Axelle was immediately invited into the studio to record her first single - and, as they say in the music world, the rest is history. The single \"Little Girls\" went rocketing to the top of the Belgian Top 50 in 1983, catapulting the young Axelle Red to overnight stardom.\\n\\nEncouraged by this early success, Axelle began spending more time in the studio and she eventually went on to record a highly accomplished demo tape. In 1985 Axelle\\'s tape would fall into the hands of the English guitarist Mick Ronson (famous for his work with rock legend David Bowie). Ronson was greatly impressed by Axelle\\'s voice and put forward the idea of producing an album with the young Belgian singer. Unfortunately, Ronson\\'s record label, Redbus, rejected the idea of releasing an album by a relative unknown and the project bit the dust. But Axelle gained a great deal of confidence from this experience. \\n\\nAfter this brief interlude, Axelle returned to her studies with renewed enthusiasm, dividing her time between a law degree and a drama course at a performing arts school. But in 1988 Axelle would abandon both her law studies and her drama course to launch a full-time singing career, after signing a major recording deal with BMG.\\n\\nAxelle called upon her brothers, Seff, Daniel and Richard, to help her with her first single and the family songwriting team would come up with Axelle\\'s legendary hit \"Kennedy Boulevard\". This single proved a huge hit in Belgium, earning Axelle Red her first gold disc in 1988. The following year the young singer was back at the top of the charts with another best-selling single entitled \"Aretha et moi\".  \\n\\nIn 1992 Axelle Red left BMG after signing a new deal with the Belgian branch of Virgin. Instead of returning to the recording studio immediately, however, Axelle would spend the next few months concentrating on writing new material for her first album.\\n\\nThe singer was finally ready to go into the studio the following year and set to work on her debut album, \"Sans plus attendre\". Released in September of that year, Axelle Red\\'s first album would not only prove a huge smash in Belgium, it would also rocket the young Belgian singer to fame in other European countries. Indeed, the catchy soul and r\\'n\\'b fusion of \"Sensualité\", the first single release from the album, would go on to become an enormous hit in France.  \\n\\nAxelle Red makes music history in belgium\\n\\nAxelle Red\\'s two follow-up singles \"Elle danse seule\" and \"Je t\\'attends\", soon echoed the success of \"Sensualité\" in Europe and Quebec. But it was Axelle Red\\'s album \"Sans plus attendre\" which was to prove the greatest success story of all. Shortly after its release \"Sans plus attendre\" went gold not once, not twice, but five times in the singer\\'s native Belgium, selling a staggering 500,000 copies - a score which made it the best-selling album of all time in Belgium !\\n\\nFollowing this phenomenal success, Axelle Red set off on her first major tour, proving that her exceptional voice was just as impressive on stage as it was on her studio recordings. The young Belgian singer was soon invited to perform at a number of prestigious European music festivals - including the famous Francofolies festival in La Rochelle, where she brought the house down in 1994.\\n\\nMeanwhile Axelle Red continued with her songwriting, working on new tracks for her second album. In 1995 the singer would achieve one of her greatest childhood dreams, flying out to the U.S.A. to record her second album in a studio in Nashville, the legendary birthplace of country music.\\n\\nAxelle Red\\'s second album, \"A tâtons\", was released in October 96. This album, which displayed even greater soul influences than Axelle\\'s first album, featured a number of special guest stars from the soul scene including Isaac Hayes and Steve Cropper, the songwriter responsible for Otis Redding\\'s legendary hit \"Dock of the Bay\".\\n\\nThe success of Axelle Red\\'s second album established the young singer as one of Belgian\\'s leading musical exports. And at the end of 97 the young Belgian star was chosen, together with Senegalese star Youssou N\\'Dour, to perform at the opening ceremony of the World Cup (held in France in June 98). The two artists were asked to perform their famous duet \"La cour des grands\", a song which they performed for the first time at the award ceremony for the Nobel Peace Prize held in Oslo on 11 December 1997.\\n\\nOn 21 March 1998 Axelle celebrated a happy event in her personal life, when she married her manager/teenage sweetheart Filip Vanes (whom she had known since law school) at a ceremony in Marrakesh (Morocco). Shortly afterwards, Axelle returned to the studio to record a Spanish version of some of her greatest hits, adapted into Spanish by Ignacio Ballesteros. The album, entitled \"Con Solo Pensarlo\", was released on 8 June 1998. Two days later Axelle, a renowned football fan, performed at the opening ceremony of the World Cup (held at the famous Stade de France) with world music star Youssou N\\'Dour. This memorable ceremony was broadcast worldwide on satellite TV.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Axelle Red\\'s album sales continued to go from strength to strength. By the end of 98 sales of Ms. Red\\'s début album had topped the 400,000 mark and her second album, \"A tâtons\", had sold 370,000 copies to date. Axelle, who has been a passionate soul fan all her life, realised one of her childhood dreams at the end of 98, organising a concert with some of the greatest living legends of the soul scene. On 16 November 1998 the Belgian star presented her special tribute show - appropriately entitled \"The Soul of Axelle Red\" - at the Palais des Congrès in Paris, taking to the stage with a host of prestigious stars including Sam Moore (of Sam and Dave fame), Eddie Floyd and Percy Sledge.\\n\\nA few weeks later Axelle Red was due to appear at another major musical event. Fans expected to catch her in concert at Amnesty International\\'s mega-concert (organised at Bercy Stadium in Paris on 10 December 98). However, the flame-haired Belgian star was forced to cancel her appearance at the last moment. Doctors advised Axelle, who was four months pregnant at the time, against performing. On 21 January 1999 the singer gave birth to a baby daughter called Janelle. Although Axelle is apparently delighted with her new role of mother, the singer was eager to get back to work as soon as possible. And it appears that Axelle wasted no time at all - she is already working on material for a new album!\\n\\nMeanwhile, Axelle\\'s career continues to go from strength to strength. Indeed, on 20 February 99 the young Belgian star triumphed at the \\'Victoires de la Musique\\' (the annual French music awards), carrying off the award for Best Female Artist of the Year.\\n\\nThat same year, she released an album in French. Entitled \"Toujours Moi\", it featured her hit, \"Ce Matin\". She then embarked upon a big tour including no less than 400 dates. A public recording released soon after the tour under the title \"Alive\" reflected the intensity of the experience.\\n\\nA Duet with Renaud\\n\\nExhausted after such a performance, Axelle Red took a year off in 2001 and travelled around the world with her family.\\n\\nIn 2002, Renaud who was working on his new opus asked her for a duet. She agreed and they recorded \"Manhattan-Kaboul\" which soon rocketed to the top of the French singles chart and scooped up the Victoires de la Musique 2003 as best song of the year.\\n\\nGoing back to the studio to record a new album, Axelle Red decided to pay a tribute to disco music, a genre she had danced upon as a teenager and rediscovered by accident during her year of travelling around. In November 2002, she released \"Face A/Face B\" that she co-produced with Al Stone (who also works with Jamiroquaï and Björk). The first single was entitled \"Je me fâche\". Even though she was expecting a child, Axelle Red embarked upon the promoting tour and did two dates at the Olympia on March 28th-29th 2003. On June 24th she gave birth to a little girl called Gloria.\\n\\nLater that year, the singer\\'s record company released a special boxed 3-CD set of Axelle Red hits which included a compilation of remixes, a series of acoustic piano-vocals numbers and bonus duets with the likes of Arno, Isaac Hayes and Charles Aznavour.\\n\\n2004 saw the release of \"French Soul\", the first Axelle Red \\'greatest hits\\' compilation. This included two CDs and a double DVD featuring all the singer\\'s video clips as well as a concert recorded live at Le Bataclan, in Paris, in November 2003 where Axelle took to the stage with four musicians from Memphis.\\n\\nAxelle Red\\'s vocal talent and her work for humanitarian causes – the singer has worked as an ambassadress for UNICEF since 1997 – were officially recognised on 6 September 2006 when the French culture minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres made her a \"Chevalier dans l\\'ordre des Arts et Lettres.\"                                                     \\n\\n2006: \"Jardin secret\"\\n\\n2006 found Axelle Red going back to her musical roots, serving up a smooth mix of soul on her new album, \"Jardin secret\", released in October. Axelle\\'s fifth studio album was recorded in Memphis, in the legendary Royal Studio owned by Al Green\\'s producer Willie Mitchell. Axelle worked with the musicians who had accompanied her on her 2003 tour and the final mix of \"Jardin secret\" was carried out in Patrice Cramer\\'s studio in Miami.\\n\\nOn 1 October 2006, a week before voting began in Belgium\\'s local elections, Axelle Red took a social stand, performing a free concert in Brussels. The singer took to the stage as part of the \"Initiative 0110\" festival campaigning against racism and promoting greater tolerance. The festival, which the media billed as an \"anti-far right\" gig, attracted a major turn-out, drawing a crowd of almost 100,000 from across the country.\\n \\nThe following year, Axelle Red was back on the live circuit, kicking off her \"Jardin secret\" tour. This included a stint at La Cigale (30 January - 10 February 2007), the venue where she had launched her career in Paris. In keeping with the soft, soul ambience of her album, Axelle kept her concerts as low-key and intimate as possible. All of them revolved around the same principle: 50 minutes of \"Jardin Secret\" followed by a handful of hits from her chart-topping years.\\n\\n*\\n\\nStraddling Belgium\\'s linguistic and cultural divide, Axelle Red has achieved enormous popularity in both the north and south of her homeland. The young Belgian singer has also proved herself to be one of the rare European artists capable of following in Aretha Franklin\\'s footsteps and performing real soul music <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Axelle+Red\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Trevor George Smith Jr. (born May 20, 1972 in Brooklyn, New York), better known by his stage name Busta Rhymes, is an American rapper and actor signed to Universal Motown. He began his rap career in the group Leaders of the New School, and had his breakout moment when they featured on A Tribe Called Quest\\'s hit, Scenario. Busta then released his debut album, The Coming, in 1996. He has since released 1997\\'s When Disaster Strikes, 1998\\'s E.L.E. (Extinction Level Event): The Final World Front, 2000\\'s Anarchy 2001\\'s Genesis, 2002\\'s It Ain\\'t Safe No More, 2006\\'s The Big Bang and 2009\\'s Back on My B.S. His ninth studio album, The Chemo, will be released early 2010 and is said to be 80% completed. \\n\\nBorn to parents Geraldine Green (1947) and Trevor George Smith Sr, and he has a younger brother, Paul Smith. His parents divorced when he 10 years old. Busta’s time during the year of 1983 was that of change, his parents got divorced and his way of thinking was altered, during that year he also changed his religious beliefs and re-named himself ‘Born Justice God Allah’ because of the supreme sorts of names that he now believed in and looked up to. He discovered hip hop music through listening to the Zulu Beats Radio Show, something influenced him from that show and three years later he would form a group. Busta also went to school in the United Kingdom, where he lived in Blackpool, Preston and Morecambe. Ended up graduating from George Westinghouse High School in downtown Brooklyn. \\nAs a youngster he played basketball, football and soccer.\\n\\nHis Panamanian baby-sitter, Aunt Mitzi, made him listen to all the rap radio stations. So, He would sit there at 2 in the morning rapping when he was supposed to be sleeping. I just couldn\\'t be too loud or Mitzi\\'s poodle would start dancing around and barking. One night, the poodle barked and Mitzi took my radio away. So he said, \"I don\\'t need that radio. I\\'ll write my own rap songs.\" Busta Rhymes later became part of a B-Boy crew with mainly latinos, a couple of white kids, and Busta, the only black one. When he was about 10 years old after he moved from Brooklyn to Long Island, where he became a member of the crew when it was a big contest happening which the leader of the crew, Johnny Juice watched. Busta just came up to him like, \"Are you Johnny Juice?\" and Johnny answered like \"Yeah.\" and he said he wanted to be down with this crew. He started poppin\\' and Johnny said he was dope so he said \"We\\'re about to do this contest\" and they wanted to put him down with them, but he didn\\'t know the routines. But they put him down anyways and they lost the contest because they didn\\'t know where to put him in the routine. The next contest they had was more of a battle, for the crown of best b-boys in Long Island and they had their crew there and they won. Busta destroyed these other guys, when he was poppin. Johnny Juice says \"even if you listen to his rhymes now, you can tell by the way he rhymes and the way he moves around he\\'s really dope on the popping shit\".\\n\\nBefore his leap to stardom, Rhymes, was a rambunctious middle-class kid from Long Island who wrote \"rap poetry\" and dropped out of high school to pursue a music career. \"I really thought he\\'d be a dancer,\" says his mother, Geraldine Green. \"At family cookouts he would win all the dance contests. He was always a showman.\" He reminds his worst job: “I used to work as a stock boy at a department store called Cheap John’s,” he says. “I knew that I couldn’t really wrap my head around doing that kind of work. Even if your heart is not in something, your mind has to at least be able to be willing to do it. So, I took the job and I worked for about two weeks, and then I quit.” Why?\\n“They just had me doing too much. I had to line up the roach sprays on the shelves and make sure they were all in order, facing the same way, with the logos facing the front. The dishwashing liquids, the detergents, the boxes that they came in when they came from the actual shipping companies that they were manufactured at. After I lined them up on the shelves, I had to cut up the cardboard boxes, fold them up neatly and tie them up so that they could do the recycling thing with them. After a couple paper cuts too many, and hands that were calloused and ashy and bruised, I said ‘this is definitely not the thing for me to continue to be doing.’”\\n\\nBusta adds, “I used that as inspiration to go into the studio all the time when I had a free moment. After work, during my lunch break, traveling back and forth to work … to just apply myself creatively, and the opportunity finally came one day when I was downtown.” At 17, Rhymes landed a six-figure record deal.\\n\\nLONS signing with Elektra\\n\\nHis first name as a rapper was Chill-o-ski, but he thought it was a corny name, and Chuck D from Public Enemy gave him a new name, Busta Rhymes. He got the name from an american football player from the eighties, George \"Buster\" Rhymes, and people always asked him to \"Bust-a-rhyme\", so the choice was easy. In the end of the eighties he met Charlie Brown at Turtlehook Middle School and they formed Leaders of the New School with Dinco \"The rhyme scientist\" D and Milo In De Dance (aka The Cut Monitor). They were on Rush Management. They was signed to Elektra Records December 12th 1989. First Recorded Appearance: “Mt. Airy Groove” from the Rubaiyat compilation, Elektra 1990. A&R Dante Ross heard about Leaders of the New School from Hank Shocklee [Bomb Squad] and Chuck D [Public Enemy] and them.He says \"I knew they were one of their burgeoning groups and I also knew they didn\\'t have a record deal. I heard they were performing and I went to check them out. I had just got my A&R gig at Elektra. I went there, saw them perform, grabbed them right after the performance and told them they had a record deal if they wanted one. LONS released 2 albums, \"A future without a past\" in 1991, and \"T.I.M.E.\" in 1993. In 1992 Busta\\'s girl was pregnant, but the baby died right after he was born, and Busta had big personal problems after that, but he got great support from his group members. In 93 they where divided because of ego in the group.\\n\\nA couple of other things that made him well known before his solo career was a couple of cameo performances, among them A Tribe Called Quest\\'s remix of \"Scenario\" with Leaders Of The New School, and the \"Flava in ya ear remix\" with Craig Mack and Rampage.\\n\\nIt took Busta three years before he released an album for Elektra, in 1996 he released \"The Coming\" with the hits \"Woo hah! Got you all in check\" featuring Rampage and \"It\\'s a party\" featuring Zhane. while recording his debut album, he left the studio to check on his new SUV. He\\'d recently purchased the Toyota Land Cruiser, a giant vehicle that gives the impression of driving on an elevated track, for $40,000. Rhymes took the elevator down and came out on Broadway, in lower Manhattan, at 11:30 p.m. His ride was gone. Furious, he marched back inside and closed the door in the recording booth. \"There was nothing I could do at that point, so I just vented that angry energy into three songs,\" he says. Woo-Hah!! Got You All in Check, one of the tracks he completed by morning, went on to become a street anthem and crossover hit, his first ever.\\n\\nThere was a short gap between the release of Busta’s first album and his second album, but it came sooner than people imagined it to. Busta was sceptical about bootleggers copying the new album so for reviewing purposes he only sent out album samplers. In 1997 he released his second album, \"When Disaster Strikes\", and after that, his popularity exploded. 1998 became a very good year for Busta, he started his own clothing line, BUSHI designs, and released his third album \"Extinction Level Event (The final world front)\" and Flipmode Squad\\'s debut \"The Imperial\". Flipmode Squad at that point included Busta Rhymes, Rah Digga, Spliff Star, Rampage, Baby Sham & Lord Have Mercy. \\n\\n1999 became a year with problems for Busta, he had to visit the courthouse a couple of times because of child support, and police stopped his car and found an unregistered gun. He lost the case about child support, and he got a 5 year probation for the other case. Now Elektra started to shut him down with less studio time and promotion for his next album. Busta didn\\'t like that, and took his squad over to J Records in 2001 after his fourth release in 2000, \"Anarchy\".\\n\\nJ Records\\n\\nHis first album at J was \"Genesis\", with the hits \"What it is\" featuring Kelis, \"Break ya neck\" & \"Pass the courvoiser part 2\" featuring Pharrell and P. Diddy. Now he is CEO for Flipmode Records. In november 2002 he released his most fervent album so far, \"It Ain\\'t Safe No More\" with the singles \"Make it clap\" featuring Spliff Star, and a remix of it featuring Spliff Star and Sean Paul. Other achievements in 2002 was the movie roles he had in \"Halloween: Resurrection\" and \"Narc\". In 2003 his SUV was shot up with 6 bullets while he was in the Violator offices, that happened just a month after a couple of people shot inside their offices. The collaboration with Mariah Carey & Flipmode Squad named \"I know what you want\" on \"It ain\\'t safe no more\" became Busta\\'s biggest hit so far.\\n\\nAftermath\\n\\nIn February 2004, Flipmode Squad joined Aftermath Records, New members was added to the squad: M. Dollars, Labba and former Blackstreet Chauncey Black joined them. In March he got a six month probation sentence after pleading no contest to a charge that he assaulted a woman during a concert in Fall River, Massachusetts, in December 2002.\\n\\nIn November 2005 the first official single off the album \"Touch it\" was released to radio. The video premiered in December. He is now the father of four children (born in 93, 99, 00 and 02). In February, while making the second video for \"The Big Bang\"- the \"Touch it remix\" ft. Mary J. Blige, Missy, Rah Digga, Lloyd Banks, Papoose and DMX, one of his bodyguards, Israel Ramirez, who recently started working security for Busta as his jewelry handler, was shot and killed shortly after midnight outside of the Kiss The Cactus Production studio in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, NY. According to eyewitnesses, the shooting was a result of an argument that began inside the studio and continued outside.\\n\\nThe Aftermath chief Dr. Dre said before the release of The Big Bang that ”All of sudden I’m hearing people in the streets talking about hos Busta’s back. In my mind, he never left, and that’s why I wanted to fuck with in the first place. He’s got that drive, and he never stops trying to top himself. Anybody who knows Busta knows that he’s always gonna come with heat.\" His third video from \"The Big Bang\" was released 10th May, \"I love my bitch\". The video features actress Gabrielle Union and the Black Eyed Peas\\' Will.i.am, who produced the song, but Kelis who is featured on the song, was not in the video. The single also features Kelis, but she\\'s not featured in the video. Also changed is his appearance, as he has cut off his trademark dreadlocks as part of a personal renewal. \"Eight years of court appearances later and I was awarded custody of my children,\" he explained. \"My hair was remindful of the unnecessary rocks in my career and life. So it was time to shed the locks... I\\'ve got my career and family right.\" \"The Big Bang\" was released 13th June. The fourth video was released in July, \"New York shit\" and the fitth video came out in August, \"In the ghetto\". The album was certified Gold in that month too. This month he was also charged with an assault after the Amsterjam Music Festival on Randalls Island, and he was ticketed after police saw him talking on his mobile while driving past a Manhattan police station.\\n\\nOn January 3rd 2007 he turned himself in to police custody after he allegedly attacking someone on Boxing Day. Lt. John Grimpel said a man told police that Rhymes, had punched and kicked him repeatedly after an argument over money. On May 3rd was arrested on a drunk driving charge by police in New York City. Officers stopped Rhymes at about 12:40 a.m. because the sport utility vehicle he was driving had overly tinted windows, officers then smelled alcohol on the rapper\\'s breath and he was subsequently arrested. was released on $7,500 bail, set by Judge Tanya Kennedy. After a 8th May court appearance, he was free to drive. Rhymes\\' lawyer said a judge ruled against a prosecution motion to suspend the rapper\\'s license following the driving-while-intoxicated arrest. He also turned down a plea deal that day that would have sent him to jail for one year, the Manhattan district attorney\\'s office said.\\n\\nBus appeared in a Super Bowl finale commercial for Pepsi Max Diet in February. Busta Rhymes pleaded guilty on 23rd January to assault, two driving infractions and weapons possession, avoiding a trial and the yearlong prison sentence recommended by prosecutors. But Judge Larry Stevens disagreed with prosecutors that Rhymes deserved time behind bars. Instead, he sentenced him to three years\\' probation and 10 days of community service for beating a fan who reportedly spat on his car in August 2006, and then assaulting his driver, Larry Hackett, that December. Rhymes was also fined $1,250 for driving with a suspended license in 2006 and driving while intoxicated in 2007. \"I just want to say that I\\'m very grateful to the judge, I\\'m very grateful to the system. I believe in the system. It hasn\\'t failed me personally yet,\" Rhymes, dressed in a crisp black pinstripe suit, said outside the courtroom.\\n\"I\\'m just glad that all of this is finally behind me and I can go back to doing what I do best - making great music and great films and being a people person,\" he said.\\n\\nHis 8th solo album \"Blessed\" was set for a release in July 2008. First he called it \"When Hell Freeze Over\" then he changed it to \"Back On My B.S.\", a title Pharrell helped him come up with, last it was changed to \"Blessed\" in April 08.

       " 'B. B. King (b. September 16, 1925 in Itta Bena, Mississippi; died May 14, 2015 in Las Vegas) was a U.S. blues guitarist and songwriter. He is among the most respected electric guitarists; Rolling Stone magazine ranked him third in its list of the hundred greatest guitarists of all time.\\n\\nBorn as Riley B. King, he began broadcasting his music live on a Memphis radio station called WDIA. At first, he used the name The Peptikon Boy on air, which later was changed to The Beale Street Blues Boy, and then further shortened to just Blues Boy or B.B.\\n\\nKing\\'s first hit on the R&B charts was \"Three o\\'Clock in the Morning\" in 1951. He first found success outside the blues market with the 1968 remake of the Roy Hawkins tune, \"The Thrill Is Gone\", which became a hit on both pop and R&B charts, a rare feat. King\\'s mainstream success continued throughout the 1970s with songs like \"To Know You Is to Love You\" and \"I Like to Live the Love\". From 1951 to 1985, King appeared on Billboard\\'s R&B charts seventy-four times.\\n\\nKing continued to record until his 80\\'s, compilations of classic songs with other top artists, and new collaborative material with artists like Eric Clapton.\\n\\nFurther facts:\\nEarly life\\n\\nKing was born in a cabin on a cotton plantation outside of Berclair, Mississippi, to Albert King and Nora Ella Farr on September 16, 1925. In 1930, his father left the family, and his mother married another man. King was raised by his maternal grandmother Elnora Farr in Kilmichael, Mississippi.[8]\\nAs a kid, King sang in the gospel choir at Elkhorn Baptist Church in Kilmichael. It seems that at the age of 12, he purchased his first guitar for $15.00,[8] although another source indicates he was given his first guitar by Bukka White, his mother\\'s first cousin (King\\'s grandmother and White\\'s mother were sisters).[9] In 1943, King left Kilmichael to work as a tractor driver and play guitar with the Famous St. John\\'s Quartet of Inverness, Mississippi, performing at area churches and on WGRM in Greenwood, Mississippi.\\nIn 1946, King followed Bukka White to Memphis, Tennessee. White took him in for the next ten months. However, King shortly returned to Mississippi, where he decided to prepare himself better for the next visit, and returned to West Memphis, Arkansas, two years later in 1948. He performed on Sonny Boy Williamson\\'s radio program on KWEM in West Memphis, where he began to develop an audience. King\\'s appearances led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis and later to a ten-minute spot on the Memphis radio station WDIA. King\\'s Spot became so popular, it was expanded and became the Sepia Swing Club.\\nInitially he worked at WDIA as a singer and disc jockey, gaining the nickname Beale Street Blues Boy, which was later shortened to Blues Boy and finally to B.B. It was there that he first met T-Bone Walker. \"Once I\\'d heard him for the first time, I knew I\\'d have to have [an electric guitar] myself. \\'Had\\' to have one, short of stealing!\", he said.\\nCareer\\n\\n1949–2005\\nIn 1949, King began recording songs under contract with Los Angeles-based RPM Records. Many of King\\'s early recordings were produced by Sam Phillips, who later founded Sun Records. Before his RPM contract, King had debuted on Bullet Records by issuing the single \"Miss Martha King\" (1949), which did not chart well. \"My very first recordings [in 1949] were for a company out of Nashville called Bullet, the Bullet Record Transcription company,\" King recalls. \"I had horns that very first session. I had Phineas Newborn on piano; his father played drums, and his brother, Calvin, played guitar with me. I had Tuff Green on bass, Ben Branch on tenor sax, his brother, Thomas Branch, on trumpet, and a lady trombone player. The Newborn family were the house band at the famous Plantation Inn in West Memphis.\\n\\n\\nPerforming with his famous guitar, Lucille\\nKing assembled his own band; the B.B. King Review, under the leadership of Millard Lee. The band initially consisted of Calvin Owens and Kenneth Sands (trumpet), Lawrence Burdin (alto saxophone), George Coleman (tenor saxophone),[17] Floyd Newman (baritone saxophone), Millard Lee (piano), George Joyner (bass) and Earl Forest and Ted Curry (drums). Onzie Horne was a trained musician elicited as an arranger to assist King with his compositions. By his own admission, he cannot play chords well[18] and always relies on improvisation. This was followed by tours across the USA with performances in major theaters in cities such as Washington, D.C., Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit and St. Louis, as well as numerous gigs in small clubs and juke joints of the southern US states.\\nIn the winter of 1949, King played at a dance hall in Twist, Arkansas. In order to heat the hall, a barrel half-filled with kerosene was lit, a fairly common practice at the time. During a performance, two men began to fight, knocking over the burning barrel and sending burning fuel across the floor. The hall burst into flames, which triggered an evacuation. Once outside, King realized that he had left his guitar inside the burning building. He entered the blaze to retrieve his beloved instrument, a Gibson hollow electric. The next day, King learned that the two men were fighting over a woman named Lucille. King named that first guitar Lucille, as well as every one he owned since that experience, as a reminder never again to do something as stupid as run into a burning building for a replaceable guitar.\\nKing meanwhile toured the entire \"Chitlin\\' circuit\" and 1956 became a record-breaking year, with 342 concerts booked. The same year he founded his own record label, Blues Boys Kingdom, with headquarters at Beale Street in Memphis. There, among other projects, he produced artists such as Millard Lee and Levi Seabury.\\nIn the 1950s, B.B. King became one of the most important names in R&B music, amassing an impressive list of hits including \"3 O\\'Clock Blues\",[14] \"You Know I Love You,\" \"Woke Up This Morning,\" \"Please Love Me,\" \"When My Heart Beats like a Hammer,\" \"Whole Lotta Love,\" \"You Upset Me Baby,\" \"Every Day I Have the Blues\", \"Sneakin\\' Around,\" \"Ten Long Years,\" \"Bad Luck,\" \"Sweet Little Angel\", \"On My Word of Honor,\" and \"Please Accept My Love.\" King was extremely busy during this period and made 342 appearances and 3 recording sessions in 1956 alone. In 1962, King signed to ABC-Paramount Records, which was later absorbed into MCA Records, and this hence into his current label, Geffen Records. In November 1964, King recorded the Live at the Regal album at the Regal Theater in Chicago, Illinois.\\nKing won a 1970 Grammy Award for the song \"The Thrill Is Gone\"; his version became a hit on both the pop and R&B charts, which was rare during that time for an R&B artist. It also gained the number 183 spot in Rolling Stone magazine\\'s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. He gained further visibility among rock audiences as an opening act on The Rolling Stones\\' 1969 American Tour. King\\'s mainstream success continued throughout the 1970s with songs like \"To Know You is to Love You\" and \"I Like to Live the Love\".\\nKing was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980, and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. In 2004 he was awarded the international Polar Music Prize, given to artists \"in recognition of exceptional achievements in the creation and advancement of music.\"\\n\\n\\nB.B. King in concert in France 1989\\nFrom the 1980s onward he has continued to maintain a highly visible and active career, appearing on numerous television shows and performing 300 nights a year. In 1988, King reached a new generation of fans with the single \"When Love Comes to Town\", a collaborative effort between King and the Irish band U2 on their Rattle and Hum album. Also that year King played for the 1988 Republican National Convention at the behest of the notorious Republican operative Lee Atwater. King has remained friendly with the Bush Family ever since and in 1990 was awarded the Presidential Medal of the Arts by George H.W. Bush and the Medal of Freedom by George W. Bush in 2008. In 2000, King teamed up with guitarist Eric Clapton to record Riding With the King. In 1998, King appeared in The Blues Brothers 2000, playing the part of the lead singer of the Louisiana Gator Boys, along with Clapton, Dr. John, Koko Taylor and Bo Diddley.\\n2006–present: farewell tour and later activities[edit]\\nOn 2006, King went on a \"farewell\" world tour, although he has been active ever since it ended. partly supported by Northern Irish guitarist Gary Moore, with whom King had previously toured and recorded, including the song \"Since I Met You Baby\".

       " 'B.G. (born Christopher Dorsey on September 3rd, 1980 in New Orleans, Louisiana) is an American rapper. Short for \"Baby Gangsta\" or \"B. Gizzle\", The rapper is often referred to as simply B.G..\\n\\nEarly life\\n\\nChristopher \"Doogie\" Dorsey was a normal kid growing up in the 13th Ward of New Orleans which is Uptown. In elementary school, young Dorsey rapped as a hobby. When Dorsey was 12, his father was murdered in a robbery, and young Dorsey drifted into street life. Dorsey began selling marijuana, cocaine, and eventually heroin — to which he later became addicted.\\n\\nThis time, local independent rap label Cash Money Records was looking for new talent, and Dorsey was recommended to the label by his barber, who also happened to cut the hair of the Cash Money CEO brothers Brian \"Baby\" Williams and Ronald \"Slim\" Williams. After an impromptu audition, Dorsey was signed to the budding label. His first effort was True Story, album as a part of The B.G.\\'z, group whom he formed with another preteen rapper, Baby D (who will later become Lil Wayne). Originally his moniker was \"Doogie\" or \"Gangsta D\", but since \"True Story\" was considered his solo CD, pseudonym B.G. stuck to him.\\n\\nMusic career\\n\\nThe second youngest artist signed to Cash Money Records, Dorsey, given the stage name \"B.G.\" (\"Baby Gangsta\"), released his debut LP, True Story, in 1992 at the young age of 12. (Lil Wayne signed at 11) As the only Cash Money artist to survive several roster purges, B.G. was instrumental in helping carry Cash Money to regional fame. Multi-millionaire label head Brian Williams, who also became an artist for the label under the name \"Baby\", allowed B.G. to catapult to success.\\n\\nHis 1996 release Chopper City is considered a southern classic and sold 147,000 copies independently. He was only 15 years old when he recorded the album. The next year, he released the albums It\\'s All on U, Vol. 1 and It\\'s All on U, Vol. 2 when Cash Money signed a $30 million deal with Universal in 1997, B.G. went to work on his seminal Chopper City in the Ghetto LP. The album spawned the massive hit \"Bling Bling\", which, along with Juvenile\\'s \"Back That Azz Up\", made Cash Money a nation wide success. \"Bling Bling\" also became a popular hip-hop slang term for any sort of expensive jewelry, automobiles, or other forms of opulence, which were featured heavily in Cash Money videos and on Cash Money album covers, as well as in B.G.\\'s life. He began wearing multiple Rolex watches and large necklaces while flashing his solid gold teeth in celebration of his success and extreme wealth.\\n\\nB.G. remained with Cash Money for the rest of the 1990s, and was a member of the Hot Boys with Juvenile, Lil\\' Wayne, and Turk. He left the label in early 2001 after disputes with Brian \"Baby\" Williams over personal issues (B.G. recently claimed that Williams used his heroin addiction to control him and cheat him out of royalties, for which he is now suing), and later signed an independent deal for his Chopper City Records label with Koch Records. In 2001, he attended a drug treatment program in Minnesota for his heroin addiction. In 2003, the Hot Boys came off a 4-year hiatus and released Let \\'Em Burn. Later in 2003, B.G. left Cash Money again, this time on bad terms with his boss Baby and longtime friend Lil\\' Wayne. He went on to release his first offering on the Koch label entitled Living Legend, which was sold as a 2-disc set. In 2004, he released Life After Cash Money. In 2005, he released The Heart of Tha Streetz Vol. 1. He also helped record \"Y\\'all Heard of Me\" with C-Murder.\\n\\nB.G. currently lives in Detroit, Michigan, running his Chopper City Records label as the C.E.O. He\\'s a veteran in the hip-hop industry at only the age of 25 and he says he\\'s not going to stop rapping anytime soon. He recently released his latest LP, The Heart Of Tha Streetz, Vol. 2, and his new single \"Move Around\" featuring Mannie Fresh. It marks the first time B.G. has worked with Mannie Fresh since they were labelmates at Cash Money Records years ago, and may well mean a boost to B.G.\\'s career commercially.\\n\\nB.G. is one of four superstar members who left Cash Money after 2003 along with Juvenile, Mannie Fresh, and Turk. Although they have all gone their separate ways, all four remain good friends and still keep in touch. There are rumors of a Hot Boyz reunion in the future, minus Lil\\' Wayne and Baby. Juveniles top song, \"Whats happenin\\'\" has a Mannie Fresh remix which includes Juvenile, B.G., and Mannie. This may be the closest to a \"Hot Boys\" reunion.\\n\\nB.G. has recently inked a deal with Atlantic Records and T.I. has been appointed executive producer of B.G.\\'s new album which is scheduled for a fall release. After spending time there on and off, B.G. permanently relocated to Detroit in 2005 as a result of Hurricane Katrina.\\n\\nIn 2006, Trina release a mixtape diss in which she humiliated B.G. along with Gillie da Kid and southern rapping rival Khia. The mixtape was recorded in response to a statement made by B.G. where he claimed Trina had a sexual relationship with both Baby and Lil\\' Wayne, whom are both rappers. Trina is currently involved with Lil\\' Wayne. Trina referred to B.G. as a \"Cash Money reject\" and a \"street n*g*a beefin\\' with a chick.\" B.G. responded (along with VL Mike) with a mixtape track \"Just A Warning \\'Till My Album Drop\" (set to the beat of DJ Drama\\'s \"Cannon Remix\", which Lil\\' Wayne collaborated on.) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/B.G.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Prince Of Rap\" (also known as just \"The Prince of Rap\") belongs to artist Bernard Greene, who, since the beginning of the 90s, has been contributing to the German dance scene. His albums \\'The Power Of Rhythm\\' (1991) and \\'The Time Is Now\\' (1994) have brought him the success he deserved.\\n\\nSince 1985 this native American has been living in Germany, and like so many artists before him, the U.S. Army brought him to Europe. After he left the Army, he began to live of his talents of singer and dancer which he had discovered during his scholarship. \"Everything began in a Gospelchoir at school\", he tells. \"My first musical experience was in a Rhythm & Blues style, which still remains my favourite music style\". \\n\\nWithout any difficulty he made his place on the Frankfurter scene, awarding first places in many rap contests. So much talent could not remains unnoticed, and he was soon contacted by the producers who would launch his international career. Among these internationally recognized people was Jam El Mar who had already made some remixes for Dr. Alban, Enigma, Frankie Goes to of Hollywood or Quincy Jones, and Stefan Benz, who co-wrote the lyrics of B.G.\\' s songs. With this team B.G. could really deserve his surname \\'The Prince OF Rap\\'. \\n\\nFor BG the public shows are as significant as the presence on the radio and in the charts. \\'Live appearances\\', he says, \\'are particularly important to me. There I can really emphasize fully my qualities of rapper. In studio I can only show a part of what I can do\\'. His shows are thus already well-known, and they allow BG to make his public discover his new creations, like Stomp. Released in 1996, this tracks contains some fast rap inserts, carried by very housy beats. \\'It\\'s a cover of a song by Brother Johnston, a song I always enjoyed. The idea of transposing it in the 90s made me enthousiastic\\'. This single announced a new album, with \\'more raps, and more soul in the accommodations\\'. \\n\\nIn 2004, B.G. was featured by Big T for the single Bad Boy. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/B.G.+The+Prince+Of+Rap\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Before his solo career, he sang in a church choir as a teenager, then joined the musical group The Triumphs. During his senior year he made friends with Roy Head of Roy Head and The Traits.

Adamson High School with such other future noted musicians as Michael Martin Murphey, Ray Wylie Hubbard and Larry Groce. As a teen he played in a variety of local rock bands before attending college, eventually joining the U.S. Air Force; upon returning from duty Stevenson settled in the Austin area, where he became a frequent attraction on the city\\'s thriving club circuit. Upon signing to RCA he was marketed primarily to country listeners, enjoying little success with either his 1972 self-titled debut or its follow-up Lead Free; the title track of 1973\\'s My Maria, however, became a Top Ten pop favorite, reaching #9 on Billboard\\'s Hot 100, although ironically it missed the country charts altogether. Stevenson had several other successful chart singles, including A Little Bit of Understanding and the original version of Daniel Moore\\'s Shambala, which, in a cover version by Three Dog Night, reached #3. However, Stevenson never again regained the success he had with the release of My Maria.\\nAfter 1974\\'s Calabasas he landed at Warner Bros. to issue We Be Sailin\\' a year later.

       " 'Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman on May 24, 1941 in Duluth, Minnesota, United States)  is an American singer-songwriter. Often regarded as one of the greatest songwriters of all time, Dylan has been a major figure in popular culture during a career spanning more than 60 years.\\nDylan started his musical odyssey in 1959 when he began playing in Dinkytown, Minneapolis while attending the University of Minnesota. Shortly after starting to play he changed his stage name to Bob Dylan, after being influenced by the poetry of Dylan Thomas before legally changing his name in 1962. \\n\\nMuch of his best known work is from the 1960s, when he became an informal documentarian and reluctant figurehead of American unrest, promoted by Joan Baez. Some of his songs, such as \"Blowin\\' in the Wind\" and \"The Times They Are A-Changin\\'\", became anthems of the anti-war and civil rights movements, with Joan Baez and Dylan singing together at the March on Washington in 1963. However he later became disenchanted with the civil liberty protest scene, feeling that he had been used by them.\\n\\nHis album Bringing It All Back Home marked a move away from the folk scene and a move towards rock and roll and Dylan began to consciously distance himself from his early association with civil rights. He also started to become irritated when being interviewed, often given facetious or irreverent answers to questions. Bringing It All Back Home was a controversial album as it the first on which he played electric guitar. This was seen by some of his fans as a betrayal of this folk roots, with some saying that it obscured his meaningful and poetic lyrics.\\n\\nThe second half of the 1960s was marked by a string of well received releases, with his song \"Like a Rolling Stone\", released in July of 1965, later being named \"The Greatest Song of All Time\" by Rolling Stone magazine in 2004, placing #1 in a list of 500 titles. It also marked the formation of Dylan\\'s backing band The Hawks (who would later call themselves simply The Band). Dylan embarked on a world tour of Australia and Europe in 1966, during which he seemed to be under a lot of strain and pressure by both his fans, the music press and his own promoters. Dylan himself admitted that he began taking drugs seriously whilst on this tour, and found it immensely hard work. On returning to New York he crashed his motorbike, sustaining serious injuries in the process, and went into a period of withdrawal while he recuperated. During the late 1960s, Dylan again changed stylistic tradition, moving away from the psychedelic culture of the time. It was then that he recorded All Along the Watchtower, perhaps more famously recorded by Jimi Hendrix.\\n\\nThe 1970s were a period during which Dylan was more sporadic in his output, releasing some poorly received LPs. He rarely appeared in person until 1974, when he began touring again with his backing band The Band. He also wrote one of his most extensively covered songs, Knockin\\' On Heaven\\'s Door, as well as what is now recognised as one of his best albums Blood On The Tracks. Towards the end of the 1970s, Dylan discovered Christ, and released some albums of gospel music. He started to talk to the crowd about his faith during his performances, and wouldn\\'t play any of his early work, which alienated some of his previous fans.\\n\\nDylan today still remains an influential and popular artist; despite a period of little note between 1980-2000, his 2006 album Modern Times reached the US chart at #1, as did his 2009 album Together Through Life, in the US, Britain, France and several other countries. His 2012 album Tempest was also critically acclaimed. Since 1988, Dylan has been on the so-called Never Ending Tour, during which his performances have provoked controversy, with some critics claiming that his lyrics have become incomprehensible, an experience which is not helped by his tendency to change his set-list and vocals almost every performance.\\n\\nBob Dylan\\'s strong influence over the past few years is becoming even more prominent amongst a growing group of younger emerging artists such as George Ellias and Devendra Banhart. Dylan\\'s early lyrics incorporated politics, social commentary, philosophy and literary influences, defying existing pop music conventions and appealing widely to the counterculture of the time. While expanding and personalizing musical styles, Dylan has shown steadfast devotion to traditions of American song, from folk and country/blues to rock and roll and rockabilly, to Gaelic balladry, even jazz, swing and Broadway.\\n\\nDylan performs with the guitar, keyboard and harmonica. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s. He has also recently performed alongside other iconic artists, such as Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell, Tom Petty and Eric Clapton. Although his contributions as a performer and recording artist have been central to his career, his songwriting is generally held as his highest accomplishment.  \\n\\nNobel Prize for Literature (2016)  - On October 13, 2016, Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for “for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition”. The prestigious award has been given annually since 1901 and previous Nobel Laureates for Literature include Harold Pinter and Samuel Beckett. Here is the speech written by Dylan, although unable to attend:\\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/10/arts/bob-dylan-nobel-prize-acceptance-speech.html?_r=0 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Brazil - aka Bia), who released her début recording in 1996 and sings in French, Portuguese and Spanish.\\n\\nDuring the years of Brazilian military government, her parents were forced into exile. They moved to Chile, then Peru and finally Portugal. She was 12 when the family went back to their homeland after the Amnisty Law. For a few years she was just a kid going to school and listening to music, brazilian music but also latin-american or anglo-saxon pop music, singing and playing guitar to her friends. Then she enters the University (Journalism) and disappointment comes : the scholar world seems too narrow for someone who’s been travelling since age 3. She chooses to take a break and go Europe for a year. It finally became years.\\n\\nBïa spends a few years sailing around the Atlantic and Mediterranean, learning more about nature, literature, languages, music and politics than she would in any school. In 1995, she decides she won’t be anything else but a musician, and starts going professional. She is living in France and so she sings in French as well as in her mother tongue, Portuguese, or Spanish that she had learned as a child.\\n\\nIn 1996, French author and producer Pierre Barouh offers her a first opportunity to record, after listening to her demo : This first album is called « La Mémoire du Vent », and earns an important prize, the « Grand Prix de l’Académie Charles Cros ». She signs translations in French of some of the songs of the great brazilian songwriter Chico Buarque, who warmly and publicly encourages her.\\n\\nIn 1998 she sings the soundtrack of a Claude Lelouch picture, goes touring in Japan, Italy and Canada, besides France where she starts to be quite well-known.\\n\\nShe releases her second album, « Sources », in 2000. Partly recorded in Rio de Janeiro, this album shows the maturity she is gaining as a songwriter, as well as her need to return to her country’s sources of inspiration. She also pays a tribute to the Beatles, which she has always loved, by covering « Golden Slumbers ».\\n\\nHer exposure in Quebec, Canada, is getting wider and wider. She makes more than a hundred concerts, radio and TV shows, and the press and public support her.\\n\\nIn 2003, Bïa releases her third album, « Carmin ». Most of the songs are hers, but she still pays hommages to her favourite songwriters such as brazilian Chico Buarque, italian Gianmaria Testa or french Henri Salvador. And she brings into light a wonderful Inca mantra, « Inti », a pre-colombian hymn to the sun played in a drum & bass unexpected and beautiful arrangement.\\n\\nPartly recorded in Paris, partly in Montreal, where she spends much of her time, this new record is sensuous, graceful, creative and irresistible.\\n\\nBia goes on singing in several latin languages, creating tasty mixes between bossa-nova or samba rithms and french language, pop flavours sang in south-american way, and some very brazilian or afro-brazilian songs. \\n\\nCarmin has been produced by Robson Galdino, a carioca (from Rio) guitar player and studio wiz living in Paris, and Erik West Millette, a bass, guitar and slides player from Montreal. Together they have managed to express all the richness and fertility of Bïa’s musical universe, in a modern and accoustic way that shows maturity and profoundness as well as playfulness.\\n\\nAfter her remarquable concert for the International Jazz Festival of Montreal in July 2003, Bïa and her group go back to Europe for concerts in Italy and France, before returning for a new tour in Québec.

       " 'Russell Tyrone Jones (November 15, 1969 – November 13, 2004) was an American rapper from New York known by the stage name Ol\\' Dirty Bastard (often shortened to ODB by mainstream media) since 1988. He was one of the founding members of the hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan.\\n\\nOl\\' Dirty Bastard simultaneously brought a measure of humor and a touch of the absurd to the Wu-Tang Clan. Often noted for his unusual mic technique (critic Steve Huey writes of Jones\\'s \"outrageously profane, free-associative rhymes\" delivered \"in a distinctive half-rapped, half-sung style\"), Jones\\'s stage name came from a 1980 kung fu film entitled Ol\\' Dirty & The Bastard, the relevance of which was articulated by Method Man\\'s assertion that there was \"no father\" to Jones\\'s style.\\n\\nAfter establishing the Wu-Tang Clan, Ol\\' Dirty Bastard went on to a successful solo career. However, his professional success was hampered by his erratic personal behavior and frequent legal troubles, including incarceration. He died in late 2004 of a drug overdose in a recording studio.\\n\\nLife and Career\\nOl\\' Dirty Bastard was born Russell Jones in Brooklyn in 1968, and grew up in the neighborhood of Fort Greene. As he got older, he started hanging out more and more with his cousins Robert Diggs and Gary Grice; they all shared a taste for rap music and kung-fu movies. Diggs, later to be known as the RZA, Grice, later the GZA, and Jones formed Force Of The Imperial Master, which subsequently became known as the All in Together Now Crew after they had a successful underground single of that name.\\n\\nWu-Tang Clan\\nThe cousins soon added six more friends and associates to the Clan, and released their debut album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) in 1993 (1993 in music). 36 Chambers received enormous critical praise, and is now widely regarded as one of the best and most influential albums of any genre to be released in the 1990s, as well as one of the best hip hop albums of all time.\\n\\nWhile most of the group\\'s members received individual praise from critics and fans, Jones became perhaps the best-known member of the group. Armed with a seemingly crazed, slurred, often off-beat, half-sung half-rapped delivery, bizarre lyrics and humorous antics that were unlike anything ever heard before in rap, he seemed to encapsulate and personify the raw, unadulterated and innovative style of the group.\\n\\nOl\\' Dirty Bastard takes his name from the 1980 film by Meng-Hwa Ho called An Old Kung Fu Master, known also as Mad Mad Kung Fu and Ol\\' Dirty & The Bastard. The movie features Yuen Siu Tien aka Simon Yuen who can also be found in other classics such as Drunken Master. Yuen Siu Tien often played a character of an old drunkard who had mastered the martial art of Drunken Boxing.\\n\\nSolo career\\nODB\\'s solo career began in 1995, the second member of the Wu-Tang Clan to release a solo album, following Method Man\\'s 1994 effort, Tical. Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version, released on March 28, 1995, spawned the hit singles Brooklyn Zoo and Shimmy Shimmy Ya, and powered the album to gold status. The album\\'s sound was as raw and gritty as 36 Chambers, producer RZA creating beats even more minimalist and stripped-down than on the group\\'s debut.\\n\\nThat same year, he was featured on the remix of Mariah Carey\\'s \"Fantasy\". What might have seemed like an unlikely pairing spawned a major hit song. \"Fantasy\" was among the first popular pop, R&B, and hip hop collaborations.\\n\\nAround this time, Jones gained notoriety when, as he was being profiled for an MTV biography, he took two of his thirteen children by limousine to a New York State welfare office to pick up his welfare check while his latest album was still in the top ten of the US charts. The entire incident was filmed by an MTV camera crew and was broadcast nationwide.\\n\\nIn 1997, ODB appeared on the Wu-Tang Clan\\'s second and most commercially successful album, Wu-Tang Forever. However, Jones appeared less often on the Clan\\'s sophomore than on the debut; he contributed a solo track titled \"Dog Shit\" as well as hooks (\"As High As Wu-Tang Get\") and spoken introductions (\"Triumph\"), but other than these appearances and featuring prominently on the songs \"Maria\" and \"Reunited,\" as well as delivering a very short verse on \"Heaterz\", he was absent.\\n\\nIn February 1998, Jones witnessed a car accident from the window of his Brooklyn recording studio. He and a friend ran to the accident scene and organized about a dozen onlookers who assisted in lifting the 1996 Ford Mustang—rescuing a 4-year-old girl from the wreckage. She was taken to a hospital with second and third degree burns. Using a false name, Jones visited the girl in the hospital frequently until he was spotted by members of the media. \\n\\nThe evening following the traffic accident, Jones rushed onstage unexpectedly during Shawn Colvin\\'s acceptance speech for \"Song of the Year\" at the Grammy Awards, and began complaining that he had recently purchased expensive clothes in anticipation of winning the \"Best Rap Album\" award that he lost to Puff Daddy. Before being escorted off-stage, he implored the audience, \"I don\\'t know how you all see it, but when it comes to the children, Wu-Tang is for the children. We teach the children. Puffy is good, but Wu-Tang is the best. I want you all to know that this is ODB, and I love you all. Peace!\" (He evidently was confused between Shawn Colvin and Sean Combs, Puff Daddy\\'s real name). His bizarre onstage antics were widely reported in the mainstream media.\\n\\nIn April 1998, he announced his new stage name, Big Baby Jesus (the first of many alternate stage names; see the list below), but was never able to give a coherent explanation for the very brief switch.\\n\\nIn 1999, he found time to release Nigga Please between jail sentences, which received much success and was even more bizarrely warped than his debut. This release included the single \"Got Your Money\" which became extremely successful in the US and elsewhere; it was produced by The Neptunes, and its success would serve as one of the production group\\'s main stepping stones to the superstardom they would later achieve. As well as the Neptunes, the single also put singer Kelis, who sang the chorus, on the map; she went on to have a successful solo career.\\n\\nIn 2001, with Jones again in jail for crack cocaine possession, his record company Elektra Records made the decision to release a greatest hits album (despite there being only two albums in ODB\\'s back catalogue) in order to both end their contract with the unreliable, troubled artist as well as make some money off the publicity generated by his legal troubles. After the contract with Elektra was terminated, the label D-3 records released the album \"The Trials and Tribulations of Russell Jones\" in 2002, comprised of tracks put together without Jones\\'s input, using the vocals he had recorded prior to his capture by authorities. The label recruited many guests including several Wu-Tang Clan affiliates, No Limit Records artist C-Murder, and the Insane Clown Posse. However, the album was critically panned and sales were poor.\\n\\nThe year 2003 brought a change in the life of Ol\\' Dirty Bastard however. The day he was released from prison, with Mariah Carey and Damon Dash by his side, Jones signed a contract with Roc-A-Fella Records, and began a new chapter in his life. Living at his mother\\'s home under house arrest and with a court-ordered probation hanging over his head, he managed to star in a VH1 reality television series. He also managed to record a new album, scheduled to be released in 2006 through Dame Dash Music Group.\\n\\nHe had stated that he also planned on collaborating with artists in the electronic music genre, such as Carnage and The Fiasco, Fischerspooner, and possibly even Massive Attack.\\nLegal troubles\\n\\nIn 1993, ODB was convicted of second degree assault for an attempted robbery and in 1994, he was shot in the abdomen following an argument with another rapper.\\n\\nIn 1997, he was arrested for failure to pay child support for three of his thirteen children. His wife, Icelene Jones, claimed he had not paid any support in over a year.\\n\\nIn 1998, he pled guilty to attempted assault on his wife and was the victim of a home invasion robbery at his girlfriend\\'s house. He was shot in the back and arm but the wounds were superficial.\\n\\nIn July 1998, only days after being shot in a push-in robbery at a cousin\\'s house in Brooklyn, he was arrested for shoplifting a pair of $50 shoes in Virginia Beach, Virginia, although he was carrying close to $500 at the time. He was issued bench warrants by the Virginia Beach Sheriffs Department to stand trial after he failed to appear in court numerous times. He was arrested for criminal threatening after a series of drunken confrontations in Los Angeles a few weeks later, and was then re-arrested for similar charges not long after that.\\n\\nDuring a routine traffic stop, the details of which remain clouded in multiple versions of events, he was arrested for attempted murder and criminal weapon possession. The case was later dismissed.\\n\\nIn February 1999, he was arrested for driving without a license and for being a convicted felon wearing a bulletproof vest (the first person arrested for this infraction under a new California law). Back in New York weeks later, he was arrested for drug possession of crack cocaine and for traffic offenses. With multiple cases in the past and present, he was arrested with marijuana and 20 vials of crack. After his arrest, ODB reportedly asked the police to \"make the rocks disappear\". During a court hearing, he once called a female prosecutor a \"sperm donor.\"\\n\\nThis criminal record was commented on by Chris Rock in his 1999 spoken word song, \"No Sex (In the Champagne Room)\", with Rock asserting that \"ODB couldn\\'tve possibly committed all those crimes. Coolio did some of that shit.\"\\n\\nODB entered rehab while still technically a fugitive from the law, but strange behavior during a subsequent court date sent him to jail for a brief period.\\n\\nIn October 2000, he escaped from his court-mandated drug treatment facility and spent one month as a fugitive. During his time on the run, he hooked up with the RZA and managed to log some time in the recording studio. He then appeared onstage swigging a bottle at a record release party for The W, a Wu-Tang Clan album. He was later arrested in a Philadelphia McDonald\\'s parking lot while signing autographs, and extradited to New York City. A Manhattan court sentenced him to two to four years incarceration. Mental problems resulted in a suicide attempt not long after his sentencing.\\n\\nIn May 2003, Russell Jones was released from prison. It was said that long time friend, Mariah Carey, picked him up after his release.\\n\\nAt first, his legal troubles and odd behavior made Jones \"something of a folk hero\", according to The New Yorker writer Michael Agger. However, Huey writes that \"it was difficult for observers to tell whether ODB\\'s wildly erratic behavior was the result of serious drug problems or genuine mental instability ... the possibility that his continued antics were at least partly the result of conscious image-making disappeared as time wore on.\"\\n\\nRussell Jones collapsed at approximately 5:29 p.m. on November 13, 2004 at Wu-Tang\\'s recording studio (36 Records LLC on West 34th Street in New York City). He was pronounced dead less than an hour later. He was buried at Brooklyn\\'s Christian Cultural Center.\\n\\nA statement was released on Saturday (November 13, 2004) evening by his mother Cherry Jones:\\n\\n    \"This evening, I received a phone call that is every mother\\'s worst dream,\" she said. \"My son, Russell Jones, passed away. To the public, he was known as Ol\\' Dirty Bastard, but to me, he was known as Rusty, the kindest, most generous soul on earth. I appreciate all the support and prayers that I have received. Russell was more than a rapper, he was a loving father, brother, uncle, and most of all, son.\"\\n\\nA statement was also released by Damon Dash, who signed ODB to Roc-A-Fella Records in the fall of 2004:\\n\\n    \"All of us in the Roc-A-Fella family are shocked and saddened by the sudden and tragic death of our brother and friend. Russell inspired all of us with his spirit, wit and tremendous heart. He will be missed dearly, and our thoughts, prayers and deepest condolences go out to his wonderful family. The world has lost a great talent, but we mourn the loss of our friend.\"\\n\\n    The cause of death remained unknown until December 15, 2004; although he reportedly complained of chest pains prior to collapsing, a heart attack was not listed as the cause of death. During the initial autopsy of the 35-year-old rapper, a doubled plastic bag containing cocaine was discovered in his stomach. Final results from an autopsy show he had a lethal mixture of the prescription painkiller Tramadol and high amounts of cocaine in his system at the time of his death, which was ruled an accidental overdose by the New York Medical Examiner\\'s Office. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ol%27+Dirty+Bastard\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Baaziz first attracted attention with his debut 1989 single, \"ya Hasrah kikount Esseghir,\" which he based on a song by Rachid Ksentini. Throughout most of his career he was banned from airplay on Algerian radio and TV. However, his most successful tune, \"Algeria My Love,\" led to special recognition from President Bouteflika.

His decision to perform a song denouncing Algeria\\'s generals, \"Waili Waili,\" on a live-broadcast television show despite warnings resulted in him being censured.

       " 'Ray Charles (Ray Charles Robinson,  Albany, Georgia, September 23, 1930 - Beverly Hills, California, June 10, 2004), was an American singer-songwriter, musician, arranger, and band leader. \\n\\nAs a rock and roll, rhythm & blues, soul, blues, jazz, country and pop musician he helped to shape the sound of rhythm & blues.\\n\\nHe brought a soulful sound to everything from country music (\"I Can\\'t Stop Loving You\") to rock and roll (\"Mess Around\"), to pop standards to a now-iconic rendition of \"America the Beautiful.\" Frank Sinatra called him \"the only genius in the business.\"\\n\\nRay Charles was born in Albany, Georgia on September 23, 1930. He was the son of Aretha Williams, a share cropper, and Bailey Robinson, a railroad repair man, mechanic and handyman. The two were never married. The family moved to Greenville, Florida, when Ray was an infant. Bailey had three more families, leaving Aretha to raise the family on her own.\\n\\nRay Charles was not born blind. He started to lose his sight somewhere at the age of five. He was rendered totally blind by the age of seven. Charles never knew exactly why he lost his sight, though there are sources that suggest his blindness was due to glaucoma, and some other sources suggest that Ray began to lose his sight from an infection caused by soapy water to his eyes which was left untreated. He attended school at the Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind in St. Augustine, Florida from 1937-1945 where he developed his musical gift that he is known and remembered for today. His father died when he was ten, followed by his mother five years later.\\n\\nIn school, he was taught only classical music, but he wanted to play what he heard on the radio, jazz and blues. After his mother died, Charles did not return to school. He lived in Jacksonville with a couple who were friends of his mother. For over a year, he played the piano for bands at the Ritz Theatre in LaVilla, earning $4 a night. Charles moved to Orlando, then Tampa, where he played \"with a hillbilly band called The Florida Playboys.\" This is where Charles began his reputation of always wearing sunglasses that were made by designer Billy Stickles.\\n\\nCharles had always played for other people, but he wanted a band that was his own. He decided to leave Florida for a large city, but Chicago and New York City were too big. He moved to Seattle in 1947 and soon started recording, first for the label Swing Time Records, achieving his first hit with the 1949 \"Confession Blues\". The song soared to #2 on the R&B charts. He followed his first recording with his only other hit with Swingtime, \"Baby, Let Me Hold Your Hand\" in 1951. It hit #5 on the R&B charts. He then signed with Ahmet Ertegün at Atlantic Records a year later. When he entered show business, his name was shortened to Ray Charles to avoid confusion with boxer Sugar Ray Robinson.\\n\\nBreakthrough period with Atlantic Records\\nAlmost immediately after signing with Atlantic, Charles scored his first hit singles with the label with \"It Should Have Been Me\" and the Ertegün-composed \"Mess Around\", both making the charts in 1953. But it was Charles\\' \"I Got A Woman\" (composed with band mate Renald Richard) that brought the musician to national prominence.\\n\\nThe song reached the top of Billboard\\'s R&B singles chart in 1955 and from there until 1959, Charles would have a series of R&B chart-toppers including \"This Little Girl of Mine\", \"Lonely Avenue\", \"Mary Ann\", \"Drown in My Own Tears\" and \"The Night Time (Is the Right Time)\", which were compiled on his Atlantic releases Hallelujah, I Love Her So, Yes Indeed!, and The Genius Sings the Blues. Charles was often cited for using his voice like a saxophone, most notably by the prominent critic Victor Bollo. During this time of transition, he recruited a young girl group from Philadelphia named The Cookies as his background singing group, recording with them in New York and changing their name to the Raelettes in the process.\\n\\nCrossover success\\nIn 1959, Charles crossed over to top 40 radio with the release of his impromptu blues number, \"What\\'d I Say\", which was initially conceived while Charles was in concert. The song would reach number 1 on the R&B list and would become Charles\\' first top ten single on the pop charts, peaking at number 6. Charles would also record The Genius of Ray Charles, before leaving Atlantic for a more lucrative deal with ABC Records in 1959.\\n\\nHit songs such as \"Georgia On My Mind\" (US #1), \"Hit the Road Jack\" (US #1) and \"Unchain My Heart\" (US #9) helped him transition to pop success and his landmark 1962 album, Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music and its sequel Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, Vol. 2, helped to bring country into the mainstream of music. He also had major pop hits in 1963 with \"Busted\" (US #4) and \"Take These Chains From My Heart\" (US #8), and also scoring a Top 20 hit four years later, in 1967, with \"Here We Go Again\" (US #15) (which would later be duetted with Norah Jones in 2004).\\n\\nLater years\\nIn 1965, Charles was arrested for possession of heroin, a drug to which he had been addicted for nearly 20 years. It was his third arrest for the offence, but he avoided jail time after kicking the habit in a clinic in Los Angeles. He spent a year on parole in 1966, when his single \"Crying Time\" reached #6 on the charts.\\n\\nDuring the late 1960s and into the 1970s, Charles\\' releases were hit-or-miss, with some big hits and critically acclaimed work. His version of \"Georgia On My Mind\" was proclaimed the state song of Georgia on April 24, 1979, with Charles performing it on the floor of the state legislature. He also had success with his unique version of \"America the Beautiful.\"\\n\\nIn November 1977 Charles appeared as the host of NBC\\'s Saturday Night Live. In the 1980s a number of other events increased Charles\\' recognition among young audiences. He made a cameo appearance in the popular 1980 film The Blues Brothers. In 1985, \"The Right Time\" was featured in the episode \"Happy Anniversary\" of The Cosby Show on NBC. The next year in 1986, he sang America The Beautiful at Wrestlemania 2. In a Pepsi Cola commercial of the early 1990s, Charles popularized the catchphrase \"You Got the Right One, Baby!\" plus he helped in the song \"We Are the World\" a touching song for USA for Africa.\\n\\nDespite his support of Martin Luther King, Jr. in the 1960s and his support for the American Civil Rights Movement, Charles courted controversy when he toured South Africa in 1981, during an international boycott of the country because of its apartheid policy.\\n\\nCharles recorded a cover version of the Japanese band Southern All Stars\\' song \"Itoshi no Ellie\" as \"Ellie My Love\" for a Suntory TV advertisement, reaching #3 on Japan\\'s Oricon chart. Eventually, it sold more than 400,000 copies, and became that year\\'s best-selling single performed by a Western artist for the Japanese music market.\\n\\nBesides winning 17 Grammy Awards in his career (include five posthumous ones), Charles was also honored in many other ways. In 1979, he was one of the first honorees of the Georgia State Music Hall of Fame being recognized for being a musician born in the state. Ray\\'s version of \"Georgia On My Mind\" was made into the official state song for Georgia. In 1981, he was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was one of the first inductees to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame at its inaugural ceremony in 1986. He received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1986. In 1987, he was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 1991, he was inducted to the Rhythm & Blues Foundation. In 1998 he was awarded the Polar Music Prize together with Ravi Shankar in Stockholm, Sweden. In 2004 he was inducted to the Jazz Hall of Fame, and inducted to the National Black Sports & Entertainment Hall of Fame. Also in 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked him #10 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\\n\\nThe Grammy Awards of 2005 were dedicated to Charles.\\n\\nOn December 7, 2007, Ray Charles Plaza was opened in Albany, Georgia, with a revolving, lighted bronze sculpture of Charles seated at a piano.\\n\\nOn December 26, 2007, Ray Charles was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame.\\n\\nRay Charles Post Office Building\\nIn 2005, the U.S. postal facility located at 4960 W. Washington Blvd., in Los Angeles, California, was designated  the Ray Charles Post Office Building. \\nOn August 24, 2005, the United States Congress honored Charles by dedicating and renaming the former West Adams Station post office in Los Angeles the \"Ray Charles Station\".\\n\\nCharles has also appeared at two Presidential inaugurations in his lifetime. In 1985, he performed for Ronald Reagan\\'s second inauguration, and in 1993 performed for Bill Clinton\\'s first inauguration.\\n\\nIn the late \\'80s and early \\'90s, Charles made appearances on The Super Dave Osbourne Show, where he performed and appeared in a few vignettes where he was somehow driving a car, often as Super Dave\\'s chauffeur. At the height of his newfound fame in the early nineties, Charles did guest vocals for quite a few projects.

       " 'Justine Washington, 13 November 1940, Bamberg, South Carolina, USA. Washington\\'s (aka Jeanette Washington) tremendously moving voice, earthy but sophisticated, perfectly epitomized uptown soul. Yet unlike her southern counterparts she has never experienced great crossover recognition, although once cited by Dusty Springfield as her all-time favourite singer. Washington was raised in Harlem, singing first in a vocal group, the Hearts, in 1956 and becoming a solo artist the following year. She built a career with 16 chart entries during a decade and a half, most of them during the 60s, recording in New York first for Donald Shaw\\'s Neptune label and then for Juggy Murray\\'s Sue label. She established herself as a major soul singer recording \"The Time\" (US R&B Top 30) and \"The Bells\" (US R&B Top 20), both in 1959, and \"Nobody Cares\" (US R&B Top 20) in 1961. Moving to Sue Records in 1962, Washington hit the US national Top 40 with the sublime \"That\\'s How Heartaches Are Made\" (1963) and the US R&B Top 10 with \"Only Those In Love\" (1965). Washington revived her career in the early 70s, recording in Philadelphia a duet with Don Gardner, a revival of the Marvelettes\\' \"Forever\", (number 30 R&B), a solo release \"I\\'ve Got To Break Away\" (number 73 R&B), and a well-received album.

       " 'Dedrick Rolison, (born August 9, 1971), better known by his stage name Mack 10 is an American rapper and actor. He was a member of hip hop trio Westside Connection, along with Ice Cube and WC. When the West Coast first rose atop the rap industry in the mid-\\'90s, Mack 10 emerged as one of the coast\\'s most promising talents alongside his longtime associate Ice Cube. The two Los Angeles rappers co-wrote \"Foe Life,\" Mack 10\\'s 1995 breakthrough hit, and united a year later with WC to form the trio Westside Connection, a West Coast gangsta rap supergroup. The Westside Connection album became a sizable hit, rocketing to number two on the Billboard album chart and boasting the anthemic \"Bow Down.\" Mack 10 continued his affiliation with Ice Cube on each successive album while at the same time launching a label of his own, Hoo Bangin\\' Records. As the \\'90s came to a close, the rapper\\'s popularity dipped a bit, and he signed with leading Dirty South label Cash Money Records in 2001, where his career underwent some unlikely twists. \\n\\n\\nBorn Dedrick D\\'Mon Rolison in 1971, Mack 10 perpetually represented Inglewood, California throughout his career, the Los Angeles neighborhood he called home. His professional rap career began in 1995 when he signed with Priority, the premier label for West Coast rap at the time, and released his self-titled album. The West Coast gangsta movement was peaking around this time, and Mack 10 capitalized on the trend with \"Foe Life,\" a song he wrote with Ice Cube, one of the West Coast\\'s reigning talents. The partnership struck gold, and the song became a coastal anthem, opening the door for a successive single, \"On Them Thangs.\" Mack 10 then partnered with Ice Cube again a year later to form the West Coast supergroup Westside Connection along with another Los Angeles rapper, WC. The three had united for a standout song on Mack 10\\'s debut album, \"Westside Slaughterhouse,\" and hoped to reprise their camaraderie for the Westside Connection album. They certainly did so, recording the boastful lead single \"Bow Down,\" which taunted the East Coast, along with several other songs discussing the East-West tension that dominated rap at the time. \\n\\n\\nMack 10 followed the number two-charting Westside Connection album with his second album, Based on a True Story, and its lead single, \"Backyard Boogie,\" in 1997. The album became his most successful, peaking at number 14 on the Billboard album chart, and confirmed his quick ascendance to fame. Moreover, the album is generally considered to be Mack 10\\'s career highlight: it features a modest number of guests (Snoop Dogg, E-40, Ice Cube), top-notch G-funk-era producers (Ant Banks, Soopafly), and little of the filler that would begin to populate his successive releases. Mack 10 returned a year later with another Top 20 album, Recipe, which is notable for its abundance of guests. In fact, only one song featured Mack 10 alone; every other song featured at least one guest, if not more; everyone from Master P and Mystikal to Jermaine Dupri and Ol\\' Dirty Bastard. Following the extravagencies of Recipe in 1997, Mack 10\\'s career began to slowly spiral downward, much like the West Coast gangsta rap scene he rode to fame. His only release in 1998 was Hoo Bangin\\': Mix Tape, more of a showcase for the many up-and-coming rappers on his Hoo Bangin\\' label than for himself, and listeners weren\\'t very interested. When Mack 10 finally did return with another full-length of his own, The Paper Route, in 2000, three years after Recipe, listeners similarly weren\\'t very interested. \\n\\nThe relative disappointment of The Paper Route brought Mack 10\\'s souring relationship with Priority Records to an end, and along came Cash Money Records, who happily signed the rapper to a contract. The partnership seemed somewhat unlikely. Cash Money was a leading Dirty South label with a small roster of in-house rappers such as Juvenile and Lil Wayne; however, the label was looking to expand its roster as well as its reach, and Mack 10 offered it a great opportunity to unite the West Coast and Dirty South. The resulting album, Bang or Ball (2001), neither topped the charts nor garnered substantial attention despite boasting \"Hate in Yo Eyes,\" a Dr. Dre production that interpolated the Bee Gees\\' \"Stayin\\' Alive.\" The album nonetheless signaled a new direction for Mack 10, who sounded surprisingly comfortable working with one of the Dirty South\\'s premier producers, Manny Fresh. Less than a year later in summer 2002 came Mack 10 Presents da Hood, a Hoo Bangin\\' release prominently featuring numerous up-and-coming West Coast rappers: K-Mac, Deviossi, Skoop, Cousteau, and Techniec. More importantly, though, the album featured \"L.A. for Ya,\" an anthemic song that was customized for the West Coast\\'s leading radio stations as well as for Lakers and Clippers home games. The customized versions worked, and the song garnered quite a bit of airplay on the West Coast, making it one of Mack 10\\'s biggest hits in years. Ghetto, Gutter and Gangster appeared in 2003 followed by Hustla\\'s Handbook two years later <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mack+10\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Mannie Fresh (born Byron Thomas on March 20, 1974), is the former in-house producer for the successful New Orleans-based record label Cash Money Records. Unlike most modern hip-hop producers, Fresh does very little outside production work, instead focusing on producing whole albums for Cash Money artists. Among his biggest hit productions are \"Back that Azz Up\" by Juvenile, \"Tha Block is Hot\" by Lil\\' Wayne, and \"Bling Bling\" by B.G.\\n\\nThe New Orleans native got his start in 1984 as a member of New York Incorporated, arguably New Orleans\\' first hip-hop crew. The parties Mannie started to DJ around this time were to become legendary and brought him to the attention of rapper Gregory D.\\n\\nMannie Fresh became the DJ and producer for Gregory D, and in 1987 on D&D Records, they released the album entitled \"Throwdown\". Though they mostly produced what would be considered Miami Bass at the time, they followed it up with an album entitled D Rules the Nation on Yo! Records in 1989. The album only contained a couple of Miami Bass style tracks, focusing more on creating a style unique to New Orleans. After they landed a deal with MCA Records, Mannie became dissatisfied with MCA\\'s handling of the project and decided to get out of the partnership. Gregory D continued to make albums that did not feature Mannie Fresh, but the duo are seen as early pioneers of Bounce Music.\\n\\nFresh also works as a recording artist, both solo and with the wealthy multi-millionaire Cash Money CEO Brian \"Baby\" Williams as a member of the Big Tymers. Mannie Fresh recently opened a car shop in Humble, Texas (a suburb of Houston) called \"Fresh Rydes\" [1]\\n\\nMannie Fresh recently announced his unexpected departure from Cash Money records, but maintains that it was strictly a business decision and he holds no ill-will towards his longtime home. On the contrary, his departure has allowed him to get back on good terms with the artists who had left Cash Money earlier, most notably B.G. (with whom he collaborated on \"Move Around\") and Juvenile (with whom he collaborated on \"Animal\"). The three are rumored to be releasing a new album by the end of 2006. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mannie+Fresh\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

At the age of 18, he went to the University of Utrecht to study Psychology and to finally live on his own with other students. It was Utrecht that made him discover deep house and producing.\\n\\nHe started practising a lot with production and deejaying and quickly developed a sound of his own. His sound, deep house with jazz and soul influences, started to get a lot of attention in this short time. He went from being an ordinary student with no musical network at all to a producer with labels and agencies knocking on his door. In september Bakermat singed a contract with agency Soulmax, knowing that they will bring him to the next level.\\n\\nHis sets are filled with joy and happines, and always melodic. Saxophones, flutes, trumpets, Bakermat tries to use them a lot because it’s the combination of these jazz instruments with deep house music that make Bakermat’s style unique. Still growing as an artist, Bakermat had a release in August on Delicieuse Records where he released the “Vandaag EP” consisting of the tracks Vandaag and Zomer (DM mix). Some other tracks that are received succesfully are “Uitzicht”, “Black Cat John Brown” and “Strandfeest”. He is currently working on productions with other artists as well like Arjuna Schiks, Tonique etc. A lot of work in progress is ready to be released and the gigs are lined up, growth is what matters! <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bakermat\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Bango is an alias of stacey pullen. Also.......\\n\\nUma das mais obscuras bandas do rock brasileiro, o Bango lançou um disco que é considerado como sendo dos melhores do nosso rock nacional da 1ª metade da década de 70. O disco auto-intitulado oferece um som mezo psicodelico, mezo rock pauleira, com uma pitada de balada Beatles. O quinteto formado por Aramis e Fernandinho nas guitarras, Elydio no baixo, Roosevelt no órgão e Max Pierre na bateria é na verdade Os Canibais com outro nome e outra proposta musical. Infelizmente há muito pouca informação disponível sobre a banda atuando sob a alcunha de Bango. Como Os Canibais, a banda se firmou como uma das mais respeitadas bandas de baile durante a década de sessenta, e banda residente de programas televisivos durante a Jovem Guarda.\\n\\nCom a virada da década, seguem as influências da época onde o rock nacional pós Tropicalismo passava a se espelhar cada vez mais nos Mutantes, tornando-se significativamente mais pesado. Junto com a mudança na concepção musical veio a mudança do nome, Bango sendo uma das várias espécies de cannabis, encontrado no nordeste Africano.\\n\\nLançam em 1972 pela gravadora Musicdisc o álbum auto-intitulado que é hoje um dos mais raros e mais procurados álbuns do nosso rock nacional. Depois ainda conseguiram colocar no mercado um compacto simples antes de encerrarem atividades. Embora não houve ainda nenhuma tentativa de se fazer um lançamento oficial do disco em CD, algumas faixas podem ser encontradas em coletâneas cobrindo o psicodelismo nacional, principalmente no mercado exterior. Não me surprenderia se houver CDR’s piratas com o disco tirado do vinil.\\n\\nPara não dizer que seus integrantes sumiram completamente, Max Pierre é um dos mais prolíficos produtores do país, trabalhando na década de setenta na Continental com bandas como A Barca do Sol, diretor artístico da Som Livre na década de oitenta, e depois assumiu a direção da Polyram na década de noventa. Com o novo milenium Max passou a vice-presidente artístico da Universal Music do Brasil. Outro que tem um curriculo respeitavel como produtor é Aramis de Barros. Na década de noventa Aramis substituiu Max como diretor artístico na Som Livre. \\n\\nhttp://whiplash.net/materias/biografias/039224-bango.html <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bango\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Barbara Acklin (28 February 1943, Oakland, California — 27 November 1998, Nebraska) was a soul singer of the 1960s and 1970s. Her biggest hit was \"Love Makes a Woman\" in 1968 which reached the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\\n\\nAs a teenager, she began singing in nightclubs while attending Dunbar Vocational High school. Upon graduation, she was hired as a secretary for local record label by her cousin, saxophonist Monk Higgins. Her first release was under the name Barbara Allen on his Special Agent label. Later, Higgins used Acklin as a background singer on his Chess Records sessions.\\n\\nIn 1966, Acklin began working as a receptionist for record producer Carl Davis at Brunswick Records. Always keeping in mind her goal of becoming a recording star, she persistently asked Davis to record her. Davis said that he would, but, in the meantime, he encouraged her to keep writing songs. Cornering Brunswick Records star Jackie Wilson, Acklin had him listen to a tune that she co-wrote with David Scott (formerly of The Exciters Band). Wilson liked it and passed it on to Davis. Released September 1966, the song, \"Whispers (Gettin Louder)\" went to number six R&B and number 11 on the Hot 100 in the fall of 1966. The song helped re-launch his career in the late 1960s. To return the favor, Wilson helped Acklin secure a recording contract with Brunswick. Acklin\\'s first chart success came from \"Show Me the Way to Go,\" a duet with Chandler, reaching number 30 R&B in the spring of 1968. In July 1968, Acklin had a hit of her own with the extremely catchy \"Love Makes a Woman,\" which went to number three R&B and number 15 on the Hot 100 in August 1968. The song also won a BMI Award.\\n\\nAnother Chandler/Acklin duet followed in October 1968. \"From the Teacher to the Preacher\" reached number 16 R&B and number 57 pop. Acklin\\'s next charting singles were \"Just Ain\\'t No Love,\" \"Am I the Same Girl\" (covered by Dusty Springfield, Swing Out Sister and The Manhattan Transfer), \"I Did It,\" \"Lady Lady Lady,\" and \"I Call It Trouble.\" In 1974, Acklin departed Brunswick for Capitol Records. Her first single, \"Raindrops,\" was a R&B hit in June of that year.\\n\\nPrior to Brunswick releasing her \"Am I the Same Girl\", they removed her voice from the track and replaced it with a piano and released as the instrumental track \"Soulful Strut,\" which became a massive hit for Young-Holt Unlimited. Unfortunately for Acklin, her release of the song did not get the promotion as \"Soulful Strut\" received. However, she was also proficient as a songwriter - in addition to \"Whispers (Gettin\\' Louder)\" for Jackie Wilson, she co-wrote \"Have You Seen Her\" with her husband Eugene Record, who was also the lead singer of The Chi-Lites, as well as several of their other biggest hits: \"Oh Girl\", \"Stoned Out Of My Mind\" and \"Toby.\"\\n\\nBarbara Acklin died from pneumonia on November 27, 1998.\\n\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Barbara+Acklin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

After the success fo the song, she continued to have success on the Country charts\\n\\nBiography\\n\\n[edit] Early life & beginnings in Nashville\\nBarbara started her career at a very young age singing country music. She cut her very first single at only 15 years old. In 1963, she moved to St. Louis, MO, and by 1965, she was a regular on a local TV show and recorded for a local label, Norman Records, but none of her singles released were much more than regional hits.\\n\\nIn 1968, after high school graduation, she decided to follow her dream and moved to Nashville. She briefly signed with Kapp Records with no success. She also recorded briefly for MCA Records. After this, she met producer Billy Sherrill, who had discovered another country singer Tammy Wynette. He listened to Barbara\\'s songs and decided that she was ready for a major record deal and he signed her with Columbia Records in 1969. Her first single in 1969, \"Love Is A Gentle Thing\", was a minor hit as was her next single, \"A Woman\\'s Hand\". In 1970, she scored her first Top 40 hit with \"A Girl Who\\'ll Satisfy Her Man\". Between 1970 and 1972, Barbara scored 4 more Top 40 hits, the biggest of these being \"Love\\'s Old Song\" and \"Thanks For The Mem\\'ries\".\\n\\n\\n[edit] The success of \"Teddy Bear Song\"\\n1973 would turn out to be the breakthrough year for Barbara as she released the biggest hit of her career with \"Teddy Bear Song\". It not only became a number 1 hit on the country charts but also reached the pop charts as well peaking at #32. It was also nominated for a Grammy that year. \"Teddy Bear Song\" spent 2 weeks at the #1 spot and became Fairchild\\'s signature song. She followed up \"Teady Bear Song\" very well with another smash hit with \"Kid Stuff\" that year which reached number 2 on the country charts and barely made the Top 100 on the pop charts at #95. In 1974, she scored another Top 10 with the song \"Baby Doll\". Between 1974 and 1977, she had several other major successes among these being \"Standing In Your Line\", \"Little Girl Feelin\\'\", \"Mississippi\", \"Cheatin\\' Is\" and \"Let Me Love You Once Before You Go\".\\n\\nBut by 1978, her country success began to rapidly fade away as her singles began to show up in the lower regions of the charts. In 1980, she signed with Paid Records where she recorded several duets with Billy Walker but none of these singles brought her back into the upper regions of the charts. In 1982, Fairchild married the evangelical singer/songwriter Milton Carroll in San Antonio, Texas. In 1986, she signed with Capitol Records in an attempt at a comeback but the single released \"Just Out Ridin\\' Around\" only reached #84 and would represent her last single to chart. And she loves her cousin Buster Prine very much..\\n\\n\\n[edit] Later career & life today\\nIncreasingly, she turned her attention to Gospel Music, where she has recorded exclusively since then both solo and with Connie Smith and Sharon White on the album Love Never Fails. She now lives in Branson, Missouri where she lives with her husband Roy Morris, himself a singer/songwriter and they perform at their own theater in Branson, singing both country and gospel music.\\n\\n\\n[edit] Discography\\n\\n[edit] Singles\\nYear Single Chart Positions Album \\nUS Country US Hot 100 \\n1969 \"Love is a Gentle Thing\" 69  Someone Special \\n\"A Woman\\'s Hand\" 66  \\n\"A Girl Who\\'ll Satisfy Her Man\" 26  \\n1970 \"(Loving You is) Sunshine\" 33  Love\\'s Old Song \\n1971 \"Love\\'s Old Song\" 28  \\n\"Color My World\" 38  \\n1972 \"Thanks for the Mem\\'ries\" 29  A Sweeter Love \\n\"A Sweeter Love (I\\'ll Never Know)\" 53  \\n\"Teddy Bear Song\" 1 32 \\n1973 \"Kid Stuff\" 2 95 Kid Stuff \\n1974 \"Baby Doll\" 6  \\n\"Standing in Your Line\" 17  Standing in Your Line \\n\"Little Girl Feeling\" 31  Barbara Fairchild \\n1975 \"You\\'ve Lost That Lovin\\' Feelin\\'\" 41  \\n\"Let\\'s Love While We Can\" 52  \\n1976 \"Under Your Spell Again\" 65  Mississippi \\n\"Let Me Love You Once Before You Go\" 22  \\n\"Cheatin\\' Is\" 15  \\n1977 \"For All the Right Reasons\" 49  Free and Easy \\n1980 \"Let Me Be the One\" (w/ Billy Walker) 74  Bye Bye Love \\n\"Bye Bye Love\"/\"Love\\'s Slipping Through Our Fingers\" (w/ Billy Walker) 70/79  \\n1986 \"Just Riding Around\" 84  single only \\n\\n\\n[edit] Albums\\nYear Album U.S. Country Albums \\n1970 Someone Special - \\n1971 Love\\'s Old Song 31 \\n1972 A Sweeter Love 17 \\n1973 Kid Stuff 14 \\n1974 Love Is a Gentle Thing 33 \\n1974 Standing In Your Line 29 \\n1975 Barbara Fairchild - \\n1976 Mississippi 49 \\n1977 Free and Easy 48 \\n1978 Greatest Hits - \\n1979 This Is Me - \\n1980 Bye Bye Love (with Billy Walker) - \\n1982 The Biggest Hurt - \\n1993 Son In My Eyes - \\n1995 Stories - \\n1995 Hymns That Last Forever - \\n1998 Classic Country - \\n1999 Rocky Top - \\n2000 Then and Now - \\n2000 All Is Forgiven (with Roy Morris) - \\n2001 For God and Country (with Roy Morris) - \\n2002 Wings of a Dove - \\n2003 Love Never Fails (with Connie Smith & Sharon White) - \\n2003 Forever Friend - \\n\\n\\n[edit] External links\\nBarbara Fairchild Official Site \\nBarbara Fairchild At All Music Guide \\nRetrieved from \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Fairchild\"\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Barbara+Fairchild\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

(McLaughlin was a black DJ at Ann Arbor radio station WHRV, now WAAM, who is also credited with discovering Del Shannon.) Her first single release in 1962, the uptempo \"My Heart Went Do Dat Da,\" did not chart nationally but was a local hit in the Detroit area. She wrote all of the songs on her debut LP (including the hit \"Hello Stranger\"). Though her follow-ups did not have the same success, her song \"Someday We\\'re Gonna Love Again\" was covered by The Searchers for a British Invasion hit.\\n\\nIn the 1960s, Lewis recorded in New York City, with producers Bert Berns and Jerry Wexler, leading to commercially-successful hits like \"Baby I\\'m Yours\" which is written by Van McCoy (\\'The Hustle\\'1975) and \"Make Me Your Baby.\" At the end of the decade she released a grittier-sounding album on Stax Records, and after its lack of commercial success, she began to withdraw from music.\\n\\nHowever, over the next decade, a number of other artists had success with Lewis\\' songs, most notably Yvonne Elliman, who made the U.S. Top 20 (and #1 on the Adult Contemporary chart) and the UK Top 30 with her version of \"Hello Stranger\" in 1977. \"Baby I\\'m Yours\" also charted in versions by Jody Miller and Debby Boone (the B-side of her single \"God Knows\").

After the war ended, a neighbourhood music teacher heard her sing and took an interest in helping her develop her talents. She was given vocal lessons and taught to play the piano, and eventually she enrolled at the Ecole Supérieure de Musique. However, money was a problem and she gave up her musical studies to sing at \"La Fontaine des Quatre Saisons\", a popular cabaret at the time in Paris.\\n\\nA sensitive girl, she was deeply scarred by the war and her family\\'s plight. Her inner feelings of emptiness showed in her appearance and in her songs. Serf wrote in her autobiography, Il etait un piano noir, that her father sexually abused her when she was ten. He later left the family, never to return; Serf went to his funeral in Nantes, which gave rise to one of her most popular songs, \"Nantes\". \\n\\n2) Barbara is a band from Hove, England, formed by brothers Henry and John Tydeman.

She is best known for her R&B chart-topping hit, \"You\\'ll Lose A Good Thing\" (1962).\\n\\nShe was born Barbara Lynn Ozen in Beaumont, Texas, and attended Hebert High School. She played piano as a child, but switched to guitar, which she plays left-handed. Inspired by blues artists Guitar Slim and Jimmy Reed, and pop acts Elvis Presley and Brenda Lee, and winning several local talent shows, she created an all-female band, Bobbie Lynn and Her Idols.\\nShe began performing in local clubs in Texas. Singer Joe Barry saw her and introduced Lynn to producer Huey P. Meaux, who ran SugarHill Recording Studios and several record labels in New Orleans. Her first single, \"You\\'ll Lose A Good Thing\", co-written by her and Meaux, was recorded at Cosimo Matassa\\'s J&M studio with session musicians including Mac Rebennack (Dr. John). Released by Jamie Records, it was a number 1 US Billboard R&B chart hit and Top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hit in 1962. The song was later recorded by Aretha Franklin and became a country hit record for Freddy Fender. Lynn also released an album, also titled You\\'ll Lose A Good Thing, which featured ten of her compositions.\\nUnusually for the time, Lynn was a female African American singer who both wrote most of her own songs and played a lead instrument. Soon Lynn was touring with such soul musicians as Gladys Knight, Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, Dionne Warwick, Jackie Wilson, Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, James Brown, Al Green, Carla Thomas, Marvin Gaye, Ike and Tina Turner, The Temptations, and B.B. King. She appeared at the Apollo Theater, twice on American Bandstand, and had her song, \"Oh Baby (We\\'ve Got A Good Thing Goin\\')\" (1964) covered by The Rolling Stones on their album The Rolling Stones Now! (1965). She continued to record for the Jamie label until 1966 and had several more minor hits.\\nIn 1966 she signed to Meaux\\'s Tribe label, and recorded \"You Left the Water Running,\" which was covered by Otis Redding among others. She signed for Atlantic the following year, and recorded another album, Here Is Barbara Lynn, in 1968. She married for the first time at age 28, in 1970 and had three children. This, together with dissatisfaction with poor promotion by the record company, contributed to her decision to largely retire from the music business for most of the 1970s and 1980s. However, while living in Los Angeles, she occasionally appeared at local clubs, and released several singles on Jetstream and other small labels.\\nIn 1984 she toured Japan, and recorded a live album, You Don\\'t Have to Go, which was released later in the US.

As a performer, though, she had a major hit single with her third release in 1965, \"Yes, I\\'m Ready\" (#5 pop, #2 R&B). She had modest success throughout the rest of the decade on the small Arctic label, run by her manager, top Philadelphia disc-jockey, Jimmy Bishop. She reached the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Top 40 again in 1965 with \"Sad, Sad Girl\", and \"Oh How It Hurts\" in 1967. A two-year stay with National General Records, run by a film production company, produced one album and four singles which failed to find success.[citation needed]\\n\\nIn the 1970s, Mason signed to Buddah Records and toughened her persona, singing about sexual love and infidelity with an uncommon frankness at the time in songs like \"Bed and Board\", \"From His Woman to You\", and \"Shackin\\' Up\" and would interrupt her singing to deliver straight-talking \\'raps\\' about romance. She also continued to write some of her new material. Curtis Mayfield produced her on a cover version of Mayfield\\'s own \"Give Me Your Love\", which restored her to the pop Top 40 and R&B Top Ten in 1973; \"From His Woman to You\" (the response to Shirley Brown\\'s single \"Woman to Woman\") and \"Shackin\\' Up\", produced by former Stax producer Don Davis in Detroit were also solid soul sellers in the mid-1970s.\\n\\nMason also sang vocals on the tracks \"Sheba Baby,\" \"I\\'m In Love With You,\" \"A Good Man Is Gone,\" and \"She Did It\" on the soundtrack for the 1975 Pam Grier film, Sheba, Baby.[2]\\n\\nAfter leaving Buddah Records in 1975 after two top ten R&B hits, she only dented the charts periodically on small labels. They included \"I Am Your Woman, She Is Your Wife\", which was produced in 1978 by Weldon McDougal who had produced her first major success, \"Yes I\\'m Ready\", and later in 1984, \"Another Man\" on West End Records.\\n\\nMason started to concentrate on running her own publishing company in the late 1980s, but continues to perform occasionally.

She has won Oscars for Best Actress and Best Original Song as well as multiple Emmy Awards, Grammy Awards, Golden Globe Awards and an honorary Tony Award. She received the prestigious Kennedy Center Honor on December 7, 2008. She is the most successful female recording artist according to the Recording Industry Assoc. of America (RIAA).\\n\\nBarbra Streisand has recorded more than 60 albums, almost all with Columbia Records. Her early works in the 1960s (her debut The Barbra Streisand Album which won two Grammy Awards in 1963, followed by The Second Barbra Streisand Album, The Third Album, My Name Is Barbra, etc.) are considered classic renditions of theater and nightclub standards, including her version of Happy Days Are Here Again. Beginning with My Name Is Barbra, her albums were often medley-filled keepsakes of her television specials.\\n\\nStarting in 1969, Streisand tackled contemporary songwriters; like many talented singers of the day, she found herself a fish out of water in attempts to tackle rock, but her vocal talents prevailed and she gained newfound success with the pop and ballad-oriented Richard Perry-produced album Stoney End in 1971. The title track, written by Laura Nyro, was a big hit for Streisand.\\n\\nStreisand\\'s 1980 album, Guilty featured the songwriting, production and vocal talents of Barry Gibb and was the best-selling album of her recording career. During the 1970s, she was also highly prominent in the pop charts, with number-one records like The Way We Were, Evergreen, No More Tears (Enough Is Enough) (her duet with Donna Summer), and Woman In Love; some of these came from soundtracks of her films. She recently took part in supporting Haiti in singing \"We are the World 25th anniversary.\\n\\nWhen the 1970s ended, Streisand was named the most successful female singer in the U.S. - only Elvis Presley and The Beatles having sold more albums. [1]\\n\\n[1] In 1982, New York Times music critic Stephen Holden wrote that Streisand was \"the most influential mainstream American pop singer since Frank Sinatra.\"\\n\\n\\n  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Barbra+Streisand\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Barrington Ainsworth Levy (born 30 April 1964) is a Jamaican reggae and dancehall artist.\\n\\nBorn in Kingston, Jamaica, as a youngster, Barrington Levy formed the Mighty Multitude with his cousin Everton Dacres. They started off playing the sound systems and cut their first single, “My Black Girl,” in 1977. All of 14, Levy broke out his own the next year and recorded his debut solo single, A Long Time Since We Don’t Have No Love.” It didn’t have much of an impact, however the teen’s appearances in the dancehalls were eagerly awaited events. It was at one of these that Levy met former singer turned producer Junjo Lawes and Mew York-based producer Hyman “Jah Life” Wright. The pair took the youth into King Tubby’s studio, accompanied by the Roots Radics, and recorded a clutch of cuts. The first fruits of this union were “Ah Yah We Deh,” quickly followed by “Looking My Love”, and “ Wedding Ring Aside.” Success was immediate, but it was the mighty “Collie Weed” that really cemented the teen’s hold of dancehall.\\n\\n“Shine Eye Girl”, was a smash follow up, and the young Levy was now in great demand. A stream of singles followed “Jumpy Girl”, a lovely version of Horace Andy’s “Skylarking”, “Reggae Music”, Levy joined forces with producer Alvin Ranglin for another sting of hits—“Never Tear My Love Apart,” “Jah”, “You Made Me So Happy,” and “When You’re Young and in Love.”Levy’s rich vocals were made for duets, both with other vocalists and DJ’s , and it wasn’t long before the young star was also recording collaborative singles. Toyan was a great foil on “Call You on the Phone””, he paired with Jah Thomas on “Moonlight Lover” and “Sister Debby”, and joined forces with Trinity for “Lose Respect” and a follow-up, “I Need a Girl” in 1980. That same year, Levy made a sensational appearance at Reggae Sunsplash, then returned in 1981. During these early years, the singer seemingly spent all of his time between the recording studios and the dancehalls. Amidst the deluge of singles, four albums arrived as well between 1979 and 1980. First up was Bounty Hunter, which boosted three smash singles—“Reggae Music”, “Shine Eye Girl”, and “Looking My Love” –and a clutch of other tracks that were just about as good. In Britain, the Burning Sounds label released Shine Eye Gal, also a hits heavy package which included the title track-track, “Collie Weed”, and “Ah Yah We Deh.” It was swiftly followed by the mighty Englishman, an absolutely fabulous record which was overseen by the unbeatable studio grouping of Junjo Lawes and two of King Tubby’s protégés—Scientist and Prince Jammy. A veteran of the clubs, he brought the spontaneity of the DJ to his records while returning vocals back to the sound system scene which had been purely the realm of the Djs. Utilizing old roots rhythms revitalized by the Radics, and giving the songs a hard, but danceable edge, Lawes and Levy together helped establish a whole new dancehall sound.\\n\\n1980’s Robin Hood merely affirmed that everyone in Jamaica already knew: That Levy was now the biggest star on t he island, with a talent that was unbeatable. Or more accurately, he was king of the singers, because ruling beside him was DJ Yellowman, another Lawes’ discovery, that was brought to him by Barrington Levy. Robin Hood was as big as its predecessor and was beginning to have an impact in Britain as well, where both it and Englishman had been released by the Greensleeves label. Not surprisingly, both albums heavy rhythms would provide the building blocks for the Scientist V Prince Jammy dub clash album. Unfortunately, Levy’s very popularity was now beginning to have some serious drawbacks. Even before stardom arrived, the singer had noticed with delight fans tapping his sets at the dancehalls, and these tapes were coming back to haunt him. Suddenly, the shelves were buckling under the weight of the bootlegged albums, featuring not just older pirated live material, but also unreleased outtakes and recycled older singles. In response, Levy didn’t release a new album for two years, but in the meantime, new singles more then made up for it. From 1980 came such hits as the haunting Lawes-produced “Mary Long Tongue” producer Linval Thompson’s “Too Poor,” and a string if hits cut with Karl Pitterson, including “ I Have a Problem” and “Even Tide Fire a Disaster”. And as the decade progressed, the flood hits continued. “I’m Not in Love”, “You Have It”, “Tomorrow Is Another Day”, “Robberman”, “BlackRose” “My Women”, and “Money Move” were just a small number of the hits released between 1981 and 1983, with the latter song the biggest smash of the batch. Levy even tried his hand at self-production, recording such excellent songs as “In the Dark” and “Love of Jah.” Amongst there were fabulous singles recorded for Joe Gibbs, “My Women” included. The Reggae Vibes album would bundle up Levy’s best with the producer, s well a number of cuts from fellow dancehall singer Sammy Dread.\\n\\n1983 finally saw the release of Levy album “Money Move”. The latter was excellently overseen by George Phang and boasted a stupendous group of rhythms that Sly & Robbie had specifically made for the producer. In the U.K, the burning sounds label also released Hunter Man, a greatest-hits collection. But the hits were still coming on strong; in 1984 none were bigger then Levy and Jah Screw produced “Under Mi Sensi.” The pair would also record a new album that year, Here I come, whose title-track would the top 50 in the U.K The album itself took Britain by storm and ensured that Levy walked away with the best Vocalist Award at Britain’s Reggae Awards. It was also these songs that secured his spot in the Guinness Book of World Records, as the first reggae artist to hold both 1st and 2nd place slots in the charts. The same year, the singer also joined forces with another young singer who was tearing up the dance floors, Frankie Paul, for the intriguing sound clash set Barrington Levy meets Frankie Paul. 1985 brought Prison Oval Rock (the Volcano Jamaican label release, and not to be confused with the RAS label’s U.S. compilation of the same title), which found the singer joining forces with Lawes again, for another roots-fired set equal to its predecessors. It had been six years since Levy burst onto the scene with all the force of a nuclear weapon. Now in his early twenties, the singer’s output significantly began to slow. He did return to Reggae Sunsplash in 1987 and would remain a top attraction at the festival until 1985. He also released “Love the Life you Live” in 1988, a rather patchy effort compared to previous releases. It was to be his last new album until 1991.But Levy wasn’t a spent force yet. Before the 80’s were over, he scored tow more hits with “My Time” and “Too Experience”, both under the aegis of producer Jah Screw, and both covers of songs written by Bob Andy (ex-Paragons and also of Bob & Marcia fame).\\n\\nSigning with MCA in t he U.S., Levy attempted to cross over into the North American market with 1983’s Barrington. Produced by Lee Jaffe, the Album featured a re-recorded “Under Mi Sensi”, and boasted strong songs as “Murderer” and “Vice Versa Love” and “Be Strong”, a major hit in the Caribbean and South America. However, the relationship with MCA was not a happy one and Levy quickly departed. Meanwhile, back in Britain, the singer was chalking up another hit with “Work”. In 1994, Levy was joined by Beenie man on the singles “Two Sounds” and “Murderer”. Both soon reappeared as fiery jungles remixes, with “Sensi”, in particular, mashing up the dance floors.\\n\\nUnder Jack Scorpio’s direction, the singer next paired with Mega Banton for “She’s Mine”. Jah Screw took these collaborations to the next logical step, and recorded an entire album and recorded and entire album of shared songs, Duets (this is its American title and it was released in the U.s. by RAS, and in the U.K., Levy’s relationship with Greensleeves continued, where the album there was titled Barrington Levy’s DJ Counteraction). From this set, “Living Dangerously” with Bounty Killer rocketed up the Jamaican charts and set pace at clubs around the world . Time Capsule came hot on its heels in 1996, a short album (a mere eight tracks plus five dubs), which more than made up for lack of quantity with quality.Over the next two years, his circle of friends was obviously growing, and 1998’s re-make of “Murderer” featured such diverse artists as rap master Snoop Doggy Dogg and Southern California punk-reggae heroes Long Beach Dub All-Stars. In 2003, his debut album Bounty Hunter was reordered and reissued as Moonlight Lover on the Burning Bush label. Two years later, the Sanctuary label collected his recordings with Henry Lawes and Alvin Ranglin for “Love Your Brother man: The Early Tear”. Numerous compilations have continued to appear featuring much of the singer’s greatest work.He was also featured in 2000 on rapper on Shyne’s debut album “Bad Boyz”, with two singles “Bad Boyz” which was number 1 on the hip-hop charts, and “Bonnie and Shynz.\\n\\nBarrington Levy continues to tour extensively, selling out shows all over the world. He is currently working in an album which will be titled “Its About Time” and he has said it will be his last. This album will feature artist like Damion Marley, Buji Banton, Beres Hammond, Heavy D and a lot more surprises. He expresses love and appreciation to all his fans across the world, and looks forward to seeing you in future events.\\n\\nLevy\\'s son Krishane is also a musician, and is signed to Atlantic Records. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Barrington+Levy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Neil Percival Young (born November 12, 1945) is a Canadian singer, guitarist, songwriter, and social activist who is widely regarded as one of the most influential musicians of his generation, particularly as Neil Young & Crazy Horse. Young was born in Toronto, but he moved to the family home of Winnipeg as a child, which is where his music career began. Young began performing as a solo artist in Canada in 1960, before moving to California in 1966, where he co-founded the band Buffalo Springfield along with Stephen Stills and Richie Furay.\\n\\nHaving success on his own for a bit, he later joined the folk rock supergroup Crosby, Stills & Nash as a fourth member in 1969, thus forming Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. He forged a successful and acclaimed solo career, releasing his first album in 1968. His career has since spanned over 40 years and 34 studio albums, with a continual and uncompromising exploration of musical styles; his musical vision is notably referred to by his autobiographical tune\"The Loner\". Music critics have often called him one of the best single artists of all time, and several tunes such as \"Heart of Gold\" and \"Rockin\\' in the Free World\" remain popular on rock radio.\\n\\nAccording to the Don\\'t Be Denied Songfacts, the 16-year-old Neil was raising chickens and selling the eggs, with plans to go to Ontario Agricultural College and be a farmer. Only his leisure activities foretold his future, when he would hide from his family problems in his room with his transistor radio playing local station CHUM. From this, Young experienced a growing admiration for rock n roll originators such as Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, and, of course, Elvis Presley. In 1958, his father bought Neil his first music instrument, a plastic ukulele. His father would later recall, \"He would close the door of his room... and we would hear plunk, pause while he moved his fingers to the next chord, plunk, pause while he moved again, plunk.\"\\n\\nIn Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, Neil started his professional music career in the mid-60s with a number of bands in Canada, including the Squires and later the Mynah Birds, which also included fellow future Buffalo Springfield bassist Bruce Palmer and future funk star Rick James. When the Mynah Birds broke up, Young and Palmer headed to California to meet Stephen Stills, whom he had met in Thunder Bay, and the result was Buffalo Springfield. That band split up after releasing three critically acclaimed albums, particularly achieving international fame for their tune \"For What It\\'s Worth\".\\n\\nShowing his strengths as a cynical yet experimental songwriter in the group, he also sung prominently in some of the band\\'s songs such as the biting satire of \\'rock star\\' life \"Mr. Soul\". Neil soon started his solo career with the release of \\'Neil Young\\' on November 12, 1968. The album did not do very well commercially, but it included several strong tracks, including \"The Loner\", said to be a portrait of Stephen Stills but also being deeply auto-biographical.\\n\\nOn May 14, 1969, he recruited members of Crazy Horse and made the critically acclaimed \\'Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\\'. This was a much more consistent album, being the first to introduce longstanding collaborators Crazy Horse and beingbuilt around the balanced interplay between the guitar playing of Young and the talented Danny Whitten.  The album also featured two lengthy classics, \"Down by the River\" and \"Cowgirl in the Sand\". The critically acclaimed solo album \"After the Gold Rush\" came out in 1971, featuring such classic songs as \"Southern Man\\'\", \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\" and \"Don\\'t Let it Bring You Down\". Harvest followed in 1972 with the hit\"Heart of Gold\".\\n\\nDuring this time he also enjoyed considerable success as a quarter of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. \\n\\nNeil\\'s subsequent work has zig-zagged across genres - dabbling in country rock on \"Old Ways\"; electronics on \"Trans\"; hooking up with the Shocking Pinks in a homage to old-time Rock \\'n\\' Roll on \"Everybody\\'s Rockin\\'\"; creating a wall of feedback on the live Arc-Weld; and cementing his status as Godfather of Grunge when collaborating with Pearl Jam on Mirror Ball.\\n\\nHis idiosyncratic approach to genre even led to him being sued by his record company (Geffen) in the 80s for making \"uncharacteristic\" music.\\n\\nYoung has also dabbled in film, most recently on the album/concert series/dvd Greendale. \\n\\nYoung is often known by the nickname \"Shakey.\"  According to his biographer Jimmy McDonough, the name was given by his friends after noticing very unsteady results holding a camera for home movies.\\n\\nYoung founded Pono Music, whose mission was to bring a digital player, download store, and streaming service devoted to hi-res music.  It was a commercial flop and was shut down in 2016.  Young has stated that the labels would not agree that \"All songs should cost the same, regardless of digital resolution.\"\\n\\nThe film Canadian Bacon includes the line \"Canadians are always trying to figure out a lot of ways to ruin our lives. The metric system, for the love of God! Celsius! Neil Young!\"\\n\\nFor recent news see: http://www.neilyoung.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Bastian Baker, born in Lausanne on 20 May 1991, is an example of the rich and diverse Swiss music scene. Songwriter, composer and performer, he has a strong inclination for “songs you can play around a fire with your friends on a summer’s evening”. Like Justin Nozuka or Jack Johnson, he excels in catchy pop-folk ballads with stirring refrains that carry us into his own world, where the carefree and the serious live side by side.\\n \\nHis heart-felt and hard-hitting melodies and texts reveal a heightened sensitivity. He writes in English “because it’s an international language!”, and it’s an important factor if you want to share your music with the whole world. He has been crazy about music since he was a very young child. He took guitar lesson at the conservatory for many years and was also the soloist in a choir.\\n \\nWith a solid experience and a repertoire of songs he has written since the age of 15, he has been playing at show-case unplugged performances, private parties and outdoor stage gigs in front of constantly enthusiastic audiences for the past two years now. In fact, during a concert he was noticed by a producer not long ago and at the same time Caprices Festival organisers noticed him and right away had the good taste to offer him a venue that reflected his talent*. Today, Bastian is working hard on his first album. This is excellent news and means soon we’ll probably hear his unique voice on radio and … echoing in our minds!\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bastian+Baker\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Beanie Sigel (born Dwight Grant on March 6th, 1974) is an African-American rapper from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, signed to Damon Dash and Jay-Z\\'s Roc-A-Fella Records in 1998.\\n\\nBeanie Sigel\\'s name derives from the street in Philadelphia where he was raised, \"Sigel Street,\" and \"Beans\" is what people used to call him as a child. Beanie also founded the group and label State Property as well as the clothing company.\\n\\nSigel\\'s debut LP, The Truth, was released February 28, 2000 on Roc-A-Fella Records. The album received a gold plaque for hits like \"The Truth\" and \"Remember The Days\" featuring Eve. His second album The Reason was released in mid-2001. The Reason was lighter material compared to his debut album and introduced the world to his own rap group State Property. Beanie Sigel helped launch the careers of fellow Philly rappers Freeway, Peedi Crakk and the Young Gunz.\\n\\nAround 2001, Beanie Sigel and Jadakiss of the Ruff Ryders were involved in a beef that stemmed from Jada claiming rappers from Beans\\' home city of Philly were simply signed because they were a hot fashion among major labels, which to some extent was true at the time. Sigel took offense to this, and they sent several tracks back and forth. Eventually Styles P. (D-Block} and Jay-Z got involved, and Beans even called out DMX, who never responded.\\n\\nThe beef went on even after Russell Simmons, owner at the time of Def Jam (the label which Roc-A-Fella was under and Ruff Ryders was affiliated with through DMX) made the two declare a brief truce and Jay-Z apologized to Jadakiss and bowed out. Disses finally stopped flying after Sigel released a scathing diss track over Jada\\'s \"Put Ya Hands Up\" beat, recalling when the LOX wore shiny suits in a Bad Boy video, among other things.\\n\\nSigel also was involved in directing his first movie State Property, the popular direct-to-video film produced by Roc-A-Films. The State Property clothing line was also created by Sigel.\\n\\nThe third album The B. Coming was released on March 28, 2005 under Dame Dash Music Group and features production from The Neptunes, Just Blaze, and Bink!, among others, with guest appearances by State Property, Redman, Snoop Dogg and usual suspects Cam\\'ron and Jay-Z. The album was recorded in the weeks between his sentencing and imprisonment and was released after he was locked up; he was released a few months ago.\\n\\nWhile he was in jail, it is said none of the State Property members except for Oschino Vazquez came to visit him. He told Dame to pass the word on that State Property was no longer in effect, until after he was released. When the split between Roc-A-Fella owners occured, Dame made it clear that Beanie\\'s intentions were to move State Property to his new Dame Dash Music Group.\\n\\nHowever, all members except for, again, Oschino, chose to go with Jay-Z. When questioned, they claimed they were signed by Jay and never needed State Property or Beanie Sigel to make them popular. When he was released from jail, Beans had a few choice words for his friends, claiming \"I still love them like brothers...I just don\\'t know if we can make music again.\"\\n\\nIt was thought that Beans had chosen to sign with Dame; however, this is unclear, as he was present at Jay-Z\\'s I Declare War concert in 2005, and has said he now has his own State Property Records under Jay-Z\\'s Def Jam.\\n\\nIn September, 2005, a jury acquitted him of charges that he nearly shot to death a man on a crowded city street two years ago. In August, Sigel left federal prison after serving nearly a year on a federal weapons charge that stemmed from a 2002 traffic stop in Philadelphia.\\n\\nSigel also has fallen behind in child-support payments. He was briefly jailed in November until he paid $27,000 in child support and $2,000 in fines, but seems to be paying off his debts.\\n\\nWith the case behind him, Sigel now plans to \"make music, make movies and work on his clothing line,\" said his attorney, Fortunato N. Perri Jr. The case was the last in a series of criminal charges against Sigel, who has a long arrest record dating back to his days growing up in South Philadelphia.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, January 10, 2006, Sigel was convicted of assault for a fight in 2003. He agreed with the prosecutor\\'s version of events, and was convicted of misdemeanor simple assault. He was immediately sentenced to two years probation plus $180 in court costs.\\n\\nThe charges stem from an argument between Sigel and a man who said the rapper punched him in both eyes, breaking his left eye socket, during a January 2003 argument outside a Chinese restaurant.\\n\\nBeanie Sigel is the co-creator of \"The Playpen\", a new animated series with writer/producers, Brian Ash and Myles Reiff. The show follows the misadventures of a group of hard-headed tykes in a maximum security daycare center called, The State Nursery. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Beanie+Sigel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A tirelessly innovative performer, Beardyman has always pushed the boundaries of what people expect from human beatbox, merging phenomenal beatbox skills with his left-field sense of humour and incredible musicality. After winning the well renowned Lyric Pad Beatbox Battle twice in 2004, he went on to win the title of London\\'s best beatboxer in the 2005 Championships and the following year became UK Beatbox Champion 2006. In May 2007, he will represent his country in the World Beatbox Championships in Berlin.\\n\\nBeardyman\\'s first musical venture was composing a symphony for his school orchestra at the age of ten. At fifteen, an introduction to drum \\'n\\' bass led to his long-standing obsession with music technology. Now, in his live shows, as well as baffllingly good solo human-beatbox, he utilzes cutting-edge sound-mangling technology to create dance-inducing layered rhythms, breath-taking soundscapes, fully produced songs and tunes, all improvised and created entirely from the human voice. No pre-recorded material is used, and everything is created live and in real time in front of the audience, who he takes on a mind-bending journey from dumbstruck to dancing and back again.\\n\\nSince starting to play out in 2001 Beardyman has shared stages with the likes of Andy C, Shy FX, Total Science, Skibadee, Conrad, Jenna G, Jungle Drummer, Grooverider, Nextmen, Jazzy Jeff, Skinnyman, Terra Firma, Wordsmith, Foreign Beggars, Phi-Life Cypher and the Freestylers to name quite a few, and has acted as compere for a huge variety of events all around Europe, including the basketball arena at the 2005 Earls Court Urban Music Festival, large gigs in London and Brighton and various corporate events. He hosted \\'The Freestyle Show\\' on Get Lucky TV from 2004 to 2005 with Klum-Z-Tung, the mind-bogglingly quick-witted freestyle-MC, with whom he performs as the Gobfathers. Once described as \\'the Fat Boys on acid\\', their freestyle antics regularly send crowds all over the UK and Europe raving mad and gagging for more.\\n\\nWhilst continuing to tour and record for forthcoming releases, he finds time to co-run the ground-breaking night, \\'Battlejam\\' with 2003 Vestax Champion JFB in his home town of Brighton. \\'Battlejam\\', now in its 12th month is having to find larger and larger venues to house itself in, having earnt a reputation as the freshest night in town, fusing Hip Hop, Breaks, Reggae, Ragga, Dancehall, Jazz, Funk and Drum \\'n\\' Bass into one sweaty but uplifting experience. Incorporating a different set of guest musicians and freestyle MC\\'s each month, everything at Battlejam is completely improvised. This is made possible by their unique use of newly developed live-sampling technology, allowing levels of crowd participation never before possible, JFB and Beardyman often sampling the crowd and scratching them into the madness.\\n\\nBeardyman has made guest appearances on Radio 1, and Kerrang Radio, and has been featured on MTV. He recently completed a tour of charity concerts for chidren\\'s cancer charity Clic Sargeant playing in some of the largest arenas in the UK to a total of some 83,000 people.

       " 'Beatriz Luengo (born December 23, 1982 in Madrid) is a Spanish actress, latin pop/R&B singer and dancer. \\n\\nIn television, she appeared in episodes of Spanish soap operas such as Robles Investigador Privado, Policías, Periodistas and El Comisario. In 2001, Beatriz was chosen to star in Un paso adelante, along with actors like Mónica Cruz, Silvia Marty, Pablo Puyol, Dafne Fernández or Lola Herrera, which made her very well-known in Spain, Europe and some South American countries; it was here that the musical group Upa Dance was born. Upa Dance sold more than 600,000 copies of their first record.\\n\\nIn spite of the big success of Upa Dance and the amount of their concerts, Beatriz has wanted to develop new musical and creative interests, reason by which she began to imagine her artistic proposal.\\n\\nIn 2005 she released her debut-solo album, \"Mi Generación\", under Universal Music label, and was recorded between Spain, Belgium and the United States. The album is purely a R&B/Pop album, mixing some flamenco beats.\\n\\nIn early 2005, she released the first single from the album, \"Mi Generación\", but failed to make impact on the Spanish charts, despite peaking at #4 on the Airplay chart.\\n\\nShe won the prize \"Better Musical Future\", and she was chosen by the Spanish audience to represent Spain at the \"Wanadoo Discoveries\" in Nice, France, and she was 2nd. She was also nominated to the MTV European Music Awards celebrated in Lisbon. She was invited in 2005 to the Grammy Awards and in 2006 to Cannes Festival in France.\\n\\nThe second single lifted from the album was \"Go Away\", a song written by American Pop star Justin Timberlake, and peaked at #1 on the Spanish Singles Chart. The third and final single was \"Hit Lerele\", a R&B song which managed to peak at #4 in Spain.\\n\\nThe album only peaked at #20 in Spain, and went to sold in excess 30,000 copies, somewhat a commercial failure for Beatriz and her label, because she is very known in Spain. \"Mi Generación\" had also an exclusive release in France, via FNAC stores, and peaked at #4 on the FNAC Top 20, without any forms of promotion.\\n\\nIn 2006, after the success of \"Un Paso Adelante\" in France, Universal released an edition of \"Mi Generación\" there, called \"BL\". The lead single was \"Hit Lerele\", and peaked at #14 in France, and sold more than 90,000 copies there, becoming a great start for the singer. The second single was \"Escape\", and did also well on the charts, peaking at #14, and selling again 90,000 copies.\\n\\nThe album was released in mid-2006, and peaked at #7, selling 130,000 copies and being certified as Gold, enjoying great success in France. The third and final single lifted from \"BL\" was the untempo R&B song \"May Yo Lo\", featuring Ruzzo from Orishas. However, this single was only a promo single for French music stations, and did well in some radio stations.\\n\\nThis album managed to peak at #58 on the European Top 100 Albums Chart, and the single \"Hit Lerele\" was also a Top 50 hit on the European Hot 100 Singles Chart. \\n\\nIn addition, Beatriz has a School of Dance in Madrid. \\n\\nAfter three years outside the music scene, she got back with a new album early 2008. The album was entirely recorded in France, and it is called \"Carrousel\".\\n\\nThe album was produced by Yotuel Romero and Andrés Levín, and Beatriz wrote all the lyrics. The album is a mixture of various rhytmes, from flamenco to R&B and Adult-Contemporary Pop.

       " ' Beck Hansen (born Bek David Campbell, July 8, 1970) is an American musician, singer-songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist.  Beck\\'s music is known for its pop-junk culture collage of musical styles, ironic lyrics, samples, drum machines, live instrumentation and heady sound effects.\\n\\nBeck was born in Los Angeles, California, to David Campbell (a musician and son of a Presbyterian minister) and Bibbe Hansen (a former dancer for The Velvet Underground, founding member of the satirical band Black Fag, and visual artist). When his parents separated, Beck stayed with his mother and brother in Los Angeles, where he was influenced by that city\\'s diverse musical offerings—everything from hip-hop to latin music—and his mother\\'s art scene – all of which would later reappear in his recorded and published work.\\n\\nAlthough Beck\\'s work defies easy description, his eclecticism and genre experiments have sparked comparisons with Prince, though Beck was undoubtedly a less prolific artist, and drew on an absurdist, free-flowing lyrical style totally original when first exposed to mainstream audiences (indeed, some critics labeled him and his breakthrough single Loser as novelties - see below). Despite this individualism, Beck\\'s music was very much a product of the 90s and the media age in general, with hip hop, indie/underground rock, electronic music and genre-benders like the Beastie Boys as notable touchstones; in addition, some critics could not resist likening his head-spinning lyrical aesthetic to a post-modern Bob Dylan sensibility.\\n\\nAfter dropping out of high school in the mid-1980s, Beck educated himself and traveled widely. In Germany, he spent time with his grandfather, fluxus artist Al Hansen. His artistic relationship with his grandfather may have influenced both his album art and sense of musical collage. He began the musical activity in 1988. The late-80\\'s found him in New York City as part of the punk-influenced anti-folk music movement.\\n\\nBeck returned to Los Angeles at the turn of the decade, destitute but motivated. During this time, Beck sought out (or snuck onto) stages at venues all over Los Angeles, from punk clubs to coffee shops. Some of his earliest and most thought-provoking recordings were achieved by working with Tom Grimley at Poop Alley Studios, a part of WIN Records.\\n\\nIn this atmosphere of heady creativity the founders of Bong Load Custom Records discovered Beck. Their 1993 12\" vinyl Loser, from an initial run of 530 copies, created a sensation on college and alternative radio that led to a furious bidding war between labels to sign Beck. Eventually, he chose Geffen Records, who offered him terms that included an allowance for the release of independent albums while under contract (he may have owed Bong Load another album or two).\\n\\nIn 1994, Geffen\\'s official debut release of Mellow Gold made Beck a mainstream smash success; it also led to his iconic status as the \"slacker\" representative of the alternative rock scene, although the title of the song had been ironic.\\n\\nAt the same time, he released Stereopathetic Soulmanure on Flipside Records and One Foot in the Grave on independent K Records. Beck took his act on the road with the 1995 Lollapalooza tour. Still, some critics panned him as a one-hit wonder. Audiences\\' (especially at Lollapalooza) familiarity with Loser only, and their general disinterest in his other work only reinforced his image as a one-hit wonder.  It\\'s been said said that Beck released Stereopathetic Soulmanure and One Foot in the Grave to shake the Gen X-ers that associated themselves with him and made \"Loser\" their slacker anthem.  \\n\\nThe one-hit wonder label was put to rest with the release of 1996\\'s Odelay, a collaborative effort with The Dust Brothers, producers of Paul\\'s Boutique. The lead single, \"Where It\\'s At\", received heavy airplay and its video was in constant rotation on MTV. Within the year, Odelay had received perfect reviews in Rolling Stone and Spin magazines, having been listed on countless \"Best of\" lists (it topped the Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for \\'Album of the Year\\'), receiving double-platinum status, and earning an impressive number of industry awards, including two Grammys.\\n\\nOdelay was followed in 1998 by Mutations. Produced by Nigel Godrich of Radiohead fame, it was intended as a stopgap measure before the next album proper. Recorded over two weeks, during which Beck recorded one song a day, the sessions produced 14 songs. Mutations was a departure from the electronic density of Odelay, and was filled with folk and blues influences. Songs on the album consisted of older tracks, some even dating back as far as 1994.\\n\\nIn 1999, Geffen released the much-anticipated Midnite Vultures, an orgy of sexual and culinary innuendo supported by a world tour. For Beck, it was a return to the high-energy performances that had been his trademark as far back as Lollapalooza. \\n\\nAfter Midnite Vultures came Sea Change in 2002, another airy and emotional album with producer Nigel Godrich, which became Beck\\'s first U.S. Top 10 album, reaching # 8.  Sea Change was conceptualized as an album with one unifying theme—the stages following the end of a relationship. The album also featured string arrangements by Beck\\'s father and a sonically dense mix reminiscient of Mutations. The Sea Change tour featured The Flaming Lips as Beck\\'s opening and backing band.\\n\\nIn September 2003, Beck returned to the studio to work on his sixth major-label album. Guero was produced by the Dust Brothers and Tony Hoffer and features a collaboration with Jack White of The White Stripes; it marked a return to Odelay-era sound. The album was released in March of 2005 and despite critical acclaim, the album received a more lackluster response from Beck\\'s indie-oriented fanbase.\\n\\nBeck married Marissa Ribisi in April 2004, shortly before the birth of their son, Cosimo Henri Hansen.  2004 also saw the release of \"10 Years of Mellow Gold,\" a short documentary about Beck\\'s first album.\\n\\nBeck\\'s next album, The Information was released on October 3, 2006. It is a largely electronic and ambient, filled with blips and beeps. It was produced by Nigel Godrich, who worked on \"Sea Change\" and a longtime Radiohead and Thom Yorke producer. The first single was Nausea, an acoustic rock hip hop song. The next single was Cellphone\\'s Dead, and the third single was Think I\\'m In Love.\\n\\nHis next single, Timebomb, was released on iTunes on August 21, 2007, and the limited edition vinyl 12\" was released on November 2, 2007, with an instrumental version of the song on the B-side. In December, 2007, it was announced that Timebomb had been nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance. \\n\\nModern Guilt was the eighth studio album by Beck. It was released on July 8, 2008. The album fulfilled Beck\\'s recording contract with Interscope Records. Outside of North America, the record was released by XL Recordings. Its three singles were Chemtrails, Gamma Ray, and Youthless.\\n\\nModern Guilt features two contributions by Cat Power and was produced by Beck and Danger Mouse.\\n\\nThe album entered both the Billboard 200 and the Canadian Albums Chart at number four, and gave Beck his first ever Top 10 placing on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number nine. The album has also been Beck\\'s best charting album in Australia, reaching 13. It sold 84,000 copies in its first week. Although successful, this does not match the first week sales of The Information, which were 99,000. In December 2008, Modern Guilt was nominated for Best Alternative Album at the 51st Grammy Awards.\\n\\nSong Reader, a project Beck released in December 2012, is 20 songs presented only as sheet music, in the hopes that enterprising musicians will record their own versions. The idea of Song Reader came about nearly fifteen years prior, shortly after the release of Odelay. When sent a book of transcribed sheet music for that album, Beck decided to play through it and grew interested in the world before recorded sound. He aimed to keep the arrangements as open as possible, to re-create the simplicity of the standards, and became preoccupied with creating only pieces that could fit within the Great American Songbook. In 2013 Beck began playing special Song Reader concerts with a variety of guests and announced he was working on a record of Song Reader material with other musicians as well as possibly a compilation of fan versions.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2013, Beck was reported to be working on two new studio albums: one a more self-contained acoustic disc in the vein of One Foot in the Grave and another described as a \"proper follow-up\" to Modern Guilt. Beck expects to release both albums independently. He released two standalone singles over the course of the summer: the electro ballad Defriended and the chorus-heavy I Won\\'t Be Long. A third single, Gimme, appeared on September 17.\\n\\nIn October 2013, it was announced that Beck signed to Capitol Records. Beck released his twelfth studio album entitled Morning Phase on 21 February 2014. For the recording of Morning Phase, Beck reunited with many of the same musicians with whom he had worked on the critically acclaimed 2002 album Sea Change. On January 20, 2014, the album\\'s first single Blue Moon was released. Beck released the second single, Waking Light, on February 4, 2014.\\n\\n4 years later, on October 13th, 2017, Beck released the second album that was supposed to come out alongside Morning Phase. This album was called Colors. Colors is very different from Beck\\'s previous albums, in which he takes a stab at pop music. Beck\\'s expertise, mixing genres, works in this album when he mixes Alternative Rock, hip hop, and a lot of Pop. The album\\'s earliest single, \"Dreams\", was released in June 2015, and three more (\"Wow\", \"Dear Life\", \"Up All Night\") were released between June 2016 and September 2017. The title track was released as a single in April 2018. The album won the Best Alternative Music Album and Best Engineered Album (Non-Classic) at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.\\n\\nAfter a short wait, Beck released Hyperspace on November 22, 2019. There was little marketing for this album. The whole album is a collaboration with Pharrell Williams, as he produced almost every song on the album. The album\\'s first single was \"Saw Lightning\" released on April 15, 2019, and had a folk-pop sound to it. It doesn\\'t fit with the rest of the album\\'s synth lo-fi sound. Other singles were \"Hyperlife\" and \"Uneventful Days\" on October 17, 2019, and \"Dark Places\" on November 7, 2019.\\n\\n\\n2) BECK can refer to a fictional rock band from the Japanese Anime series BECK: Mongolian Chop Squad. The fictional BECK\\'s songs feature in the BECK Original Sound Track. BECK\\'s style and members are highly influenced by various different artists. From vocals in the style of Zack De La Rocha from Rage Against the Machine, guitar influenced by Tom Morello of the same band, the band is highly influenced by rap-rock.\\n\\nAs the series develops, other influence appear, including guitar in the style of Led Zeppelin\\'s Jimmy Page, and Red Hot Chili Peppers John Frusciante. During the series, the band covers a famous The Beatles song, \\'I\\'ve got a Feeling\\'. The name BECK could have possibly been influenced by the first artist Beck, mentioned above. Harold Sakushi, the original author of the series, has confirmed that BECK is generally based around the Red Hot Chili Peppers, being his favourite band. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Beck\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Anthony Moses Davis (born August 22, 1973 in Kingston, Jamaica), better known by the stage name Beenie Man, is a well established reggae artist and DJ. He was involved in the music industry from a young age when he won the Tastee Talent contest in 1981. Only one year later, when he was eight years old, he recorded a single, \"Too Fancy\", with record producer \"Junjo\" Lawes. By 1983, Beenie Man was recording with heavyweight DJs, such as Dillinger and Fathead and released his debut album, The Invincible Beenie Man: The Ten Year Old DJ Wonder and the single \"Over the Sea\".\\n\\nHe was booed off stage at a show celebrating the visit of Nelson Mandela. In 1993 at the very popular show Sting he accused fellow deejay Bounty Killer that the elder artist had stolen his catchphrase, \"people dead\". This triggered a lyrical battle which continued on the air with each artist counteracting the other\\'s songs. Finally, in 1995, Beenie Man and Bounty Killer settled their differences on the air by actually signing a peace treaty and the two recorded an album together, Guns Out. This was followed by a single, \"No Mama No Cry\", a rehash of the Bob Marley classic \"No Woman No Cry\", speaking out against violence and inspired by the murder of Pan Head, another popular Deejay.\\n\\nPartially as a result of prodding from his producers, Sly and Robbie, Beenie Man soon converted to the Rastafari movement.\\n\\nIn 1994, he was signed by Island Records and released the critically acclaimed album Blessed.\\n\\nIn 1995, Beenie Man released a remix of Barrington Levy\\'s \"Under Mi Sensi\" in the United Kingdom, and collaborated with Dennis Brown and Triston Palma to release Three Against War and Lt. Stitchie on Mad Cobra Meets Lt. Stitchie & Beenie Man. He took another step up the ladder in 1996, releasing the seminal Maestro, produced by Patrick Roberts and shot him to UK fame. During the period from the mid to late \\'90s, Beenie Man dominated the Jamaican charts to the extent that he perhaps had a good claim to the crown of \"Dancehall King\", a title only bestowed previously on Yellowman in the early 1980s.\\n\\nIn 1998, Beenie Man signed to Virgin Records to release albums in the United States. His first American offering was The Doctor (1998). In 2000, Beenie Man teamed up with Arturo Sandoval and Wyclef Jean (The Fugees) to release The Art & Life. During the late 1990s, Beenie Man began his conquest of America with the hits, \"Romie\", \"Who Am I\" and \"Girls Dem Sugar\", which featured American R&B singer, Mya.\\n\\nIn 2002, he had a sizeable hit with a duet with Janet Jackson called \"Feel It Boy\", but his biggest break in America came in early 2004 with the release of a remix of \"Dude\", featuring guest vocals by fellow Jamaican Ms. Thing, as well as rhymes by Shawnna. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Beenie+Man\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Belinda Carlisle (born August 17, 1958 in Hollywood, California) is the lead vocalist and a founding member of the all-female New Wave band Go-Go\\'s. She is also a successful solo artist.\\n\\nA former high school cheerleader, Carlisle is the eldest of seven children.\\n\\nEarly Career and The Go-Go\\'s\\n\\nCarlisle\\'s first venture into music was a brief stint as drummer for the punk band The Germs under the name Dottie Danger, although illness prevented her from ever performing with them live. Soon after leaving this band she founded the Go-Go\\'s (originally named The Misfits) with friend and fellow music novice Jane Wiedlin. With bassist-turned-guitarist Charlotte Caffey, guitarist-turned-bassist Kathy Valentine, and drummer Gina Schock, the Go-Go\\'s became one of the most successful American bands of the early 80\\'s, helping to usher \"new wave music\" into popular American radio and becoming the first all-female band in rock history to achieve a #1 album, who also wrote their own music and played their own instruments. The Go-Go\\'s recorded two more studio albums (including Vacation, which went gold thanks to the title track). \"Head over Heels,\" from the album Talk Show, made it to #11, but they never repeated the success of their multi-platinum debut, Beauty and the Beat, which featured the hits \"We Got the Beat\" and \"Our Lips Are Sealed\".\\n\\nThe antics of the Go-Go\\'s in the early- to mid-1980s contrasted with their public image. Since then, the group\\'s notoriety from that time period had become something of a legend, involving drugs and sex. Years later, in a 2007 interview with PlanetOut, Carlisle said that the band had female groupies and said, \"Well, without going into too much detail ... I think all of us in the band, we\\'ve all had ... we\\'ve all seen the experience you are probably wondering about. And, yeah, like I said, without going into too much detail, we\\'ve all been there and done that.\"\\n\\nSolo career\\n\\nThe Go-Go\\'s broke up in 1985, and Carlisle embarked on a solo career (although she continued to work with fellow Go-Go Charlotte Caffey). Carlisle\\'s first album, Belinda, was released on I.R.S. Records in 1986. Her #3 summer hit \"Mad About You\" was followed by the Motown-influenced single \"I Feel The Magic\" and by a cover version of Band of Gold, all three songs included on the album.\\n\\nDuring this time, Carlisle also had songs featured on movie soundtracks, notably \"In My Wildest Dreams\" the opener in the movie Mannequin, as well as \"Dancing in the City\" from the Whoopi Goldberg movie Burglar.\\n\\nHeaven on Earth\\n\\nCarlisle changed her hairstyle significantly for her second solo album, giving up her California Girl blonde bob for a long auburn do for 1987\\'s Heaven on Earth.The musical style eschewed the 1960s-influenced pop of Carlisle\\'s first album in favor of slickly produced 1980s power-pop and was released in the United States through MCA and in the United Kingdom through Virgin). The album became a Top Five bestseller in the UK and Australia and was nominated for an Grammy Award. The album\\'s producer, Rick Nowels, previously worked with Stevie Nicks and would later collaborate with Madonna.\\n\\nThe first release from Heaven on Earth was \"Heaven Is a Place on Earth\" which topped the single charts not only in the US but also in the UK and Australia. (The dance mix of the song also topped the dance chart.) The radio-ready song was further propelled by a video directed by Academy Award-winning American actress Diane Keaton. The second release from Heaven on Earth was the US #2 and UK Top 10 smash \"I Get Weak\" written by Diane Warren; it was accompanied by another Keaton-directed video. The third single and video from the album was \"Circle in the Sand\" another Top 10 hit in the US, the UK and Germany too. \"World Without You\" was another British hit, followed by 1988\\'s low-charting ballad \"Love Never Dies\" in the UK. In the U.S., the fourth single \"I Feel Free\" a cover of the Cream classic, missed the Top 40.\\n\\nRunaway Horses\\n\\nCarlisle\\'s follow-up to the success of Heaven on Earth was \"Runaway Horses\" of October 23, 1989. The album again hit the Top Five in both Australia and the UK, certified double platinum in Australia and platinum in the UK, but failed to reach similar success in the US. The first release, Leave a Light On peaked at #11 in the US and became another Top Five smash in the UK and Australia. The song features a slide guitar solo by George Harrison (see Greatest Hits). The second US single, \"Summer Rain\" reached #30 in Spring 1990. The song, which Carlisle noted was the most difficult song she had ever sung up to that point, peaked successfully at #6 in Australia where it has maintained popularity, and the tune saw a cover version in 2004 by the Australian group Slinkee Minx. Whereas in the US, Carlisle\\'s success was decreasing, her popularity remained big in Europe and Australia. In 1990, further singles from the \"Runaway Horses\" album were successful as well, the summer mood influenced La Luna,a Top 20 hit in Germany and Australia, and the powerful rock hymne (We Want) the Same Thing, another Top 10 smash in the UK. In the late autumn of 1990, the Go-Go\\'s reunited for a tour to support their greatest-hits album \"Go Go\\'s Greatest\", including a new recording of the cover song \"Cool Jerk\". A notable feature of the tour was an anti-fur campaign, where the band members supported People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), an animal rights organization. Later in the year, Carlisle joined with The Smithereens lead singer Pat Dinizio on his group\\'s ballad \"Blue Period.\"\\n\\nLive Your Life Be Free\\n\\nIn 1991, Carlisle released her fourth solo album, Live Your Life Be Free. The album marked somewhat of a return to 1960s-influenced music for Carlisle. The single \"Do You Feel Like I Feel?\" was accompanied by a tongue-in-cheek video inspired by the B-movie Attack of the 50 Foot Woman. The title track \"Live Your Life Be Free\" merged 1960s influences with producer Rick Nowel\\'s trademark bombast, and featured a video that emphasized colorful imagery, fashion, and Carlisle\\'s photogenic face. Subsequent releases, \"Half the World\" and \"Little Black Book\" were also hits outside the U.S. Although Live your life be free flopped in the US due to a huge lack of promotion from the record company, it did have success in Europe (Top 10 in the UK) including the title track as take off single, a Top 20 hit in the UK and Australia.\\n\\nThe Best of Belinda Vol.1\\n\\nAfter her bad experiences concerning promotion with her US record company, Belinda broke her contract there. Still active in Europe and Australia with a record contract at Virgin Records, her 1992 <<Best of>> CD underlined in an impressive way the popularity of her songs, The Best of Belinda Vol.1 a 15 track collection, triumphantly reached #1 in both, the UK and Australia and certified double platinum in both territories. The greatest hits album included all the hits taken from Heaven on Earth, Runaway Horses and Live Your Life Be Free, only omitting the ballad \"Love Never Dies\", and the three I.R.S. singles from her first album, namely \"Mad About You\", \"I Feel The Magic\" and \"Band of Gold\"; also no soundtrack song features on the collection. Private luck was on her side as well, as later that year Belinda gave birth to her only son, James Duke.\\n\\nReal\\n\\nCarlisle\\'s fifth solo album, \"Real\", was released 1993 on the Virgin label in the U.S. and in Europe. Produced without Nowels, the disc was a departure from Carlisle\\'s polished pop music formula. Gone was her glamorous image and picture-perfect pop. Even the album\\'s cover photograph featured her with very little make-up. Carlisle co-produced and co-wrote much of the disc, collaborating heavily with friend and former Go-Go\\'s member Charlotte Caffey. The album reached #9 in the UK and its first single \"It\\'s Too Real (Big Scary Animal)\" reached a respectable #12 placing in the UK. The second single from Real was \"Lay Down Your Arms\", which made the Top 30 in the UK, but did not fare well in other territories, hence it was noticeably absent from Carlisle\\'s second greatest-hits album.\\n\\nAt this time, Carlisle also recorded \"One by One\" on the soundtrack of the 1993 movie \"The Harvest\".\\n\\nAfter the Northridge Earthquake in 1994, Carlisle and her family moved to Europe. The Go-Go\\'s reunited again later that year to support the retrospective double-CD \"Return to the Valley of the Go-Go\\'s\" which included three new songs, however the band broke up after the promotional tour. Carlisle has since lived in France and England.\\n\\nA Woman and a Man\\n\\nCarlisle returned to the recording studio and resumed working again with Rick Nowels. In 1996, she released in the UK and Australia her sixth solo album, A Woman and a Man, on the Chrysalis Records label. This album, consisting of mostly relaxed adult pop, revitalized her solo career in Europe and included several hits. The leadoff single \"In Too Deep\" returned Carlisle to the UK Top 10 for the first time in six years, reaching #6.\"Always Breaking My Heart\", written and produced by Roxette\\'s Per Gessle, peaked at #8. The album spawned two more UK hits, \"Love in the Key of C\" and \"California\". Another track of the album never released as a single was \"He goes on\" written by Crowded House\\'s Neil Finn. The album reached at number #12 in the UK, and was certified gold. As a result of A Woman and A Man\\'s UK success, the album was released in the U.S. during the summer of 1997 on the Ark21 label. Despite the recent successful comeback in Europe and the promotional appearances Carlisle made on American television and radio, the album did not enjoy similar success in North America.\\n\\nIn preparation for this album, Belinda recorded a demo of a song called \\'Falling into you\\', which was subsequently (and to Belinda\\'s surprise) rejected by her then record company; Chrysalis. Shortly afterwards this song was recorded and released by Celine Dion and went on to become one of the biggest hits of her career.\\n\\nIn 1996, Carlisle recorded \"I Wouldn\\'t Be Here (If I Didn\\'t Love You)\" for the Two if by Sea official movie soundtrack. In 1997, she recorded \"I Won\\'t Say (I\\'m in Love)\" from Disney\\'s Hercules as part of that movie\\'s standard distribution in Europe and was released as a single exclusively in France and Germany. Neither of these tracks have been released on compilation albums.\\n\\n\\nGreatest Hits\\n\\nIn 1999, Carlisle released a greatest hits album in the UK, a double-disc on the Virgin label. Carlisle recorded three new tracks for the album, including the single \"All God\\'s Children\", and the songs \"A Prayer for Everyone\" and \"Feels Like I\\'ve Known You Forever\". The second disc of her \"A Place on Earth\" greatest hits album contained remixes of some of her hits. Some of the remixes were done by William Orbit, who also worked with Madonna on her 1998 \"Ray of Light\" album. The album was certified gold in the UK.\\n\\nVoila\\n\\nIn 2007, the singer released her seventh album Voilà, which was her first solo studio work of full album length in over ten years. The album was produced by John Reynolds. Consisting of a mix of French pop tunes and chanson standards, including covers of Françoise Hardy and Édith Piaf classics. Voilà was released via Rykodisc in the U.K. on 5 February 2007 and in the U.S. the following day. Belinda was originally approached to make another \\'pop\\' album, but she declined immediately in favour of recording this collection of songs, the style of which, she\\'d \\'absolutely fallen in love with\\', since moving to France in the early 90\\'s. The list of prominent and respected producers and collaborators on the album clearly shows the esteem in which Belinda is held among her peers. While \\'Voila\\' received glowing reviews worldwide it failed to make any real impact on the charts. This is regarded by no means as a failure for Belinda, who has stated it was never part of the plan for the album to become a big hit but rather a rich opportunity for her to indulge her love of classic french love songs and share that love with her loyal fanbase.\\n\\nCollaborations\\n\\nDuring her solo career, Carlisle has had the opportunity to work with numerous prominent musicians from the 1960s. Michelle Phillips of The Mamas and The Papas, Chyna Phillips and Carnie Wilson (pre-Wilson Phillips) did backup singing for Heaven on Earth; Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys arranged and sang back-up on \"California\" from A Woman and A Man. She performed live with her idols the Beach Boys, and performed with Freda Payne when Carlisle covered Payne\\'s classic hit \"Band of Gold.\" As mentioned above, ex-Beatle George Harrison contributed guitar work to the single \"Leave a Light On\", as well as the song \"Deep Deep Ocean\", both tracks found on the Runaway Horses album. Belinda performed backing vocals on Then Jerico\\'s album Big Area on the track \"What Does it Take?\", She also performed back vocals on The Smithereens album 11 for the track \"Blue Period\".\\n\\nShe also worked with noted musicians of her own generation, such as Duran Duran\\'s Andy Taylor on her debut solo album Belinda (Taylor appears in her \"Mad About You\" video clip); Thomas Dolby played the keyboards in some Heaven on Earth tracks; and Bryan Adams did backup vocals in \"Whatever It Takes\" from the Runaway Horses album. Another notable collaboration was the one with the ambient mastermind and legend Brian Eno who played the keyboards in her latest release Voila.\\n\\nPersonal life\\n\\nIn 1986 Carlisle married Morgan Mason, son of the British actor James Mason and former Deputy United States Chief of Protocol. Morgan made appearances in Carlisle\\'s videos \"Mad About You\" and \"Heaven Is a Place on Earth\". They have a son, James Duke Mason, (born April 27, 1992).\\n\\nShe has been reported as being \"deeply into Buddhist chanting\", though precisely what form is unclear.[2] In an interview printed on March 7, 2007, the singer stated that \"I was wondering about happiness and started reading a lot of books by the Dalai Lama, and slowly embraced Buddhism\" (published by Newindpress, India). On Sydney Morning Herald: \"\"I don\\'t smoke anymore, I don\\'t drink any more and I don\\'t do drugs any more. I am very much into my Buddhism. I found turning 40 a real passage in time for me\".\\n\\nShe appeared nude (tastefully but full frontally) in the cover story of the August 2001 Playboy, around the time of a Go-Go\\'s reunion tour and album. [1] [2] She was 42 years of age when the photos were taken.\\n\\nLater career\\n\\nSince their late 1990s reconciliation and 2001 reunion, the Go-Go\\'s have continued playing and touring together almost every summer. In recent years Carlisle has continued making singing and non-singing television appearances. She has been a frequent guest on music-related programs and she appeared on a celebrity edition of ABC\\'s Who Wants to be a Millionaire? In 2004 she appeared on the ITV1 reality show Hell\\'s Kitchen as one of ten celebrity chefs competing against one another. She has also appeared on the ITV1 reality show Hit Me Baby One More Time, where she sang a cover of Coldplay\\'s hit, \"The Scientist\" as well as her own \"Heaven Is a Place on Earth\".\\n\\n2006–2007\\n\\nCarlisle continued her string of TV appearances in 2006, having signed to appear on the Simon Cowell-produced Celebrity Duets, a FOX network reality competition pairing celebrities not famous for singing (like Lucy Lawless and Cheech Marin) with actual singers like Carlisle, Michael Bolton, Jon Secada and Macy Gray. Carlisle sang \"Heaven is a Place on Earth\" and \"I Get Weak\" with Lea Thompson in the September 7 episode.\\n\\nCarlisle also performed on the opening night of Manchester Gay Pride 2007.\\n\\nCarlisle performed a set with other 1980\\'s acts at Retro Fest on 1st September 2007 at Culzean Castle in Ayrshire, Scotland.\\n\\nDiscography\\n\\nAlbums\\n\\n* Belinda (1986)\\n* Heaven on Earth (1987)\\n* Runaway Horses (1989)\\n* Live Your Life Be Free (1991)\\n* The Best of Belinda, Volume 1 (1992)\\n* Real (1993)\\n* A Woman and a Man (1996)\\n* A Place on Earth - The Greatest Hits (1999)\\n* Voilà (2007)\\n\\nTop ten singles\\nThe following singles peaked in the Top Ten either in Australia, Switzerland, United Kingdom or the United States.\\n                                                 AU        SI    UK     US\\n1986 - \"Mad About You\"                           9         —     67     3\\n1987 - \"Heaven Is a Place on Earth\"              2         1     1      1\\n1988 - \"I Get Weak\"                              34        24    10     2\\n\"Circle in the Sand\" \\t                             75     \\t — \\t4 \\t7\\n1989 \\t\"Leave a Light On\" \\t                     5  \\t 8 \\t4 \\t11\\n\"La Luna\" \\t                                     21 \\t 10 \\t38 \\t—\\n1990 \\t\"Summer Rain\" \\t                             6           —      23 \\t30\\n\"(We Want) the Same Thing\" \\t                     — \\t         — \\t6 \\t—\\n1996 \\t\"In Too Deep\" \\t                             11 \\t — \\t6 \\t—\\n\"Always Breaking My Heart\" \\t                     50 \\t — \\t8 \\t—\\n\\nSee also\\nList of artists who reached number one on the Hot 100 (U.S.)\\nList of artists who reached number one on the UK Singles Chart\\n\\nInterviews\\nAudio interview with SYN 907 Melbourne\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\n* Belinda Carlisle at the Internet Movie Database\\n* Official Website\\n* Belinda-Carlisle.net\\n    * Belinda Carlisle - A Place On Earth\\n    * Ananova article on Carlisle appearance in Playboy (via Wayback Machine)\\n    * Belinda Carlisle at Tv.com\\n    * Belinda Carlisle Music Collection\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n   1. ^ http://www.planetout.com/content/slideshow/splash.html?coll=2976&order=3&navpath=/entertainment/celebrities Planetout.com Retrieved on 05-14-07\\n   2. ^ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/02/04/svbelinda04.xml Telegraph.co.uk Retrieved on 05-14-07\\n\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Belinda+Carlisle\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Annabella Avery \"Bella\" Thorne (born October 8, 1997) is an American actress and model and musician. An accomplished child model and actress with appearances in more than 20 films and television series and more than 40 commercials, she is best known for her role as the aspiring young dancer, CeCe Jones on the Disney Channel original series Shake It Up!\\n\\nBella Thorne was born on October 8, 1997 in Pembroke Pines, Florida.

       " 'Huddie Ledbetter (Artist: Leadbelly or Lead Belly, January 20, 1888 - December 6, 1949) was an iconic American folk and blues musician, and multi-instrumentalist, notable for his strong vocals, his virtuosity on the twelve-string guitar, and the songbook of folk standards he introduced.\\n\\nAlthough Lead Belly most commonly played the twelve-string, he could also play the piano, mandolin, harmonica, violin, and accordion. In some of his recordings, such as in one of his versions of the folk ballad \"John Hardy\", he performs on the accordion instead of the guitar. In other recordings he just sings while clapping his hands or stomping his foot.\\nThe topics of Lead Belly\\'s music covered a wide range of subjects, including gospel songs; blues songs about women, liquor, prison life, and racism; and folk songs about cowboys, prison, work, sailors, cattle herding, and dancing. He also wrote songs concerning the newsmakers of the day, such as Franklin D. Roosevelt, Adolf Hitler, Jean Harlow, the Scottsboro Boys, and Howard Hughes.\\nIn 2008, Lead Belly was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.\\n\\nThough many of his posthumous releases list him as \"Leadbelly,\" he himself spelled it \"Lead Belly.\" This is also the usage on most of his original records, tombstone, as well as of the Lead Belly Foundation.\\n\\nLeadbelly was born in Mooringsport, Louisiana, and spent time in and out of prison most of his life. In 1933, serving a sentence for attempted murder, musicologists John and Alan Lomax \"discovered\" him on a field recording tour sponsored by the Library of Congress. That summer, he was pardoned by the governor of Lousiana after recording his plea for pardon on a record, together with \"Good Night Irene\". Leadbelly went on to make hundreds of recordings of all sorts of different songs: country, blues, spirituals, reels, and work chants.\\n\\nHis songs have been covered by Mark Lanegan, The Animals, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Nirvana, Lonnie Donegan, Johnny Cash, Gene Autry, The Beach Boys, Led Zeppelin, British Sea Power, Ram Jam, Ry Cooder, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Half Man Half Biscuit, Tom Waits, Shocking Blue , Nirvana, The White Stripes, Long John Baldry.\\n\\nRock & Roll Hall Of Fame Biography: Lead Belly Biography\\nBIO Biography: Lead Belly Biography\\nLead Belly Foundation: Lead Belly Foundation.org\\nLead Belly is also on Last.fm as Lead Belly <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Leadbelly\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, popularly known as The Weeknd (born February 16, 1990 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada), is a Canadian R&B/hip-hop musician, singer-songwriter and record producer. He chose his stage name in tribute to when he was 17 years old, when, along with his friend La Mar Taylor, he dropped out of high school, took his mattress, and \"left one weekend and never came home\". However, his estranged former producer Jeremy Rose claims the name was his idea. The letter E was excluded to avoid trademark problems with the Canadian band The Weekend.\\n\\nThe Weeknd gained widespread critical acclaim for his three mixtapes: House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence, which he later compiled to make a remastered, three-disc album titled Trilogy after signing his record deal with Republic. In 2013, he released Kiss Land, which was considered to be his debut studio album.\\n\\nIn 2014, he dropped “Often,” a remix of Beyonce’s “Drunk In Love,” and “King of the Fall.” The Weeknd released two songs in collaboration with the film Fifty Shades of Grey, with Earned It becoming his solo breakout hit.\\n\\nHis second studio album became highly-anticipated, with riveting singles like  The Hills and Can’t Feel My Face leaving fans hungry for more. Beauty Behind the Madness was released on August 28, 2015.\\n\\nHis third studio album, Starboy, was released on November 25, 2016. The Daft Punk-assisted title track led the project as its first official single, released on Wednesday, September 21, 2016, before becoming his third number one track in the United States, as also his home country, Canada. The effort was a commercial success, topping the Billboard 200 albums chart with over 348,000 copies sold in its first week, all eighteen tracks debuting on the Billboard Hot 100, receiving a GRAMMY Award for the Best Urban Contemporary Album, category at the 60th annual ceremony, overall for the second time in his music career and being ranked as the third most popular album of 2017 in the U.S.\\n\\nNext came the My Dear Melancholy EP, released on March 30, 2018 and revolving around his breakups with Bella Hadid during summer of 2016 and Selena Gomez in October 2017. With the lead single, Call Out My Name, the Canadian singer earned the largest first-day Spotify stream count of any song released in 2018 at that time and his eighth Top 10 entry on Hot 100.\\n\\nTesfaye’s fourth studio album (and his first in three years), After Hours was officially released on March 20, 2020, and is named after a 1985 movie directed by his idol, Martin Scorsese. It was primarily supported by November 2019-released singles Heartless and Blinding Lights, with the pair becoming his fourth and fifth #1 singles in the US and the latter his first #1 single in the UK. The title track and In Your Eyes were also released as singles.\\n\\nAlthough widely expected to receive multiple nominations for After Hours, Tesfaye failed to receive any nominations for the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards (2021). Tesfaye took to his social media to criticize the Recording Academy, claiming corruption. Speculation arose that the announcement of his then-upcoming Super Bowl performance as well as the discrepancy of being nominated as pop music versus R&B contributed to the snubs. On February 5, 2021 The Highlights was released, as his second greatest hits album. Tesfaye performed at the Super Bowl LV halftime show on February 7, 2021 after announcing he would perform in November 2020. He reportedly spent $7 million on his performance at the show. Despite having a mixed response, the show resulted in a surge in streaming and downloads for Tesfaye\\'s After Hours album as well as for the seven other songs he performed.\\n\\nHis fifth album, Dawn FM was released on January 7, 2022, continuing the writing and production work with Swedish pop svengalis Max Martin and Oscar Holter. The album was preceded by the single Take My Breath in August 2021, with Sacrifice announced as the second single. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Weeknd\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Ben E. King (born Benjamin Earl Nelson in September 28, 1938 (died of natural causes, aged 76 on April 30, 2015.) in Henderson, North Carolina) was an American soul and pop singer. He is best known as the singer and co-composer of \"Stand by Me\", a top ten hit in both 1961 and 1986.\\n\\nIn 1958, Ben Nelson joined a doo wop group, The Five Crowns. Later that same year, The Drifters\\' manager fired the members of the group and replaced them with The Five Crowns, who had performed several engagements with The Drifters. He co-wrote the first hit by the new version of The Drifters, \"There Goes My Baby\" (1959). He also sang lead, using his birth name, on \"Save the Last Dance for Me,\" a song written by Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman, \"Dance With Me,\" \"This Magic Moment,\" \"I Count the Tears,\" and other The Drifters hits.\\n\\nIn 1960 he left the group after failing to gain a salary increase and a fairer share of the group\\'s royalties. At this point he assumed the more memorable stage name Ben E. King in preparation for a solo career. Remaining on Atlantic, King scored his first solo hit with the stylish, Latin-tinged ballad \"Spanish Harlem\" (1961). \"Stand by Me\" was his next recording. \"Stand by Me\", written by King along with Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller was voted one of the Songs of the Century by the Recording Industry Association of America. \"Stand by Me\" and \"Spanish Harlem\" were named as two of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\\'s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll and were both also given a Grammy Hall of Fame Award.\\n\\nKing\\'s records continued to place well on the pop charts until 1963, when British pop bands began to dominate the popular music scene.

       " 'Benjamin Scott Folds (born September 12, 1966, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina) is an American singer-songwriter. He is widely known for his prowess as a pianist. Ben Folds\\' musical career started to get off the ground in the late \\'80s, as bassist for band Majosha, after playing bass and piano at Pinehurst, in a group known as the \"Caroliners\" with cohort Millard Powers in 1985-1987; he also played drums as a session musician in Nashville. As well as appearing in Pots & Pans - now known as the Snuzz demo, as a pianist in Britt Harper Uzzell\\'s (aka Snuzz) band.  Folds is best known for his later work as the frontman and pianist of Ben Folds Five and as a solo artist. Folds\\'s compositional and playing technique remain wholly unique, combining elements of the typical \\'singer/songwriter\\' genre, jazz, and power rock. Indeed, his music is evocative of artists such as Joe Jackson, Todd Rundgren, and Sir Elton John, with an added edge and bold infusion of energy and wit. Although his music has no distinctive genre with which it is associated, the terms piano rock and indie are often used to describe his unique style. It is worth noting that popular, piano-centric artists such as trio-based Keane and solo artist Matt Hales, a.k.a. Aqualung, began their rise to popularity after Ben Folds\\' three-member band, Ben Folds Five, broke up in 2000. The other two members of Ben Folds Five were Robert Sledge (bass) and Darren Jessee (drums).\\n\\nAs of fall 2006, Ben Folds has released five solo LPs. His first album, Fear of Pop: Volume 1, an album of spoken word and instrumental compositions, was recorded and released while Ben Folds Five was still together. Since it was an uncharacteristic release, and officially released under the moniker of \\'Fear of Pop\\', it is widely considered that his first \"proper\" solo album was Rockin\\' the Suburbs (2001), on which he played all the instruments by himself. A year later, in 2002, he released Ben Folds Live, a collection of live solo recordings. In late 2003, two solo EPs, Speed Graphic and Sunny 16, were released, with a third entitled Super D released in mid-2004. In 2005, Folds released a second studio album called Songs for Silverman. Most recently Folds has released the album \"Supersunnyspeedgraphic, the lp\" a compliation of his EPs, a The Bens track called \"Bruised,\" \"Still\" from the motion picture of 2006 \"Over the Hedge\" for which Folds wrote all the songs, his cover of the Dr. Dre song \"Bitches Ain\\'t Shit\", and, with the kind permission of his good friend Neil Hannon, a cover of The Divine Comedy song \"Songs of Love\".  \"Supersunnyspeedgraphic, the lp\" otherwise includes remastered takes from the three internet EPs from 2002-2004. Ben claims that he wanted to have the CD in hard format so he could \"put it past him.\"\\n\\nBen resides in Nashville with his wife, Fleur.  He often tours the United States, the United Kingdom, other countries in Europe, Japan, and Australia.\\n\\nFolds\\' tours are famous for his solo act as \"Ben Folds and a piano\", often having the audience become involved by \"playing\" the accompanying instruments (such as the trumpet and saxophone harmonies in \"Army\") and singing choir-like backing vocals on \"Not the Same\". His concerts are charismatic, yet calm - an enjoyable experience for most. And although Folds is constantly putting out new songs, his concerts rarely omit classic fan favorites such as \"Philosophy,\" \"One Angry Dwarf and 200 Solemn Faces,\" and \"Army.\" Also, a seemingly fan favorite that started in Chicago, IL was \"Rock this Bitch,\" a song where Folds has to come up an impromptu new tune with the words \"Rock this Bitch\" in it; though the song seems to be phasing out, it still makes appearances on tours, such as the November 2006 tour and the Spring US College tour of 2007 and 2008.\\n\\nFolds also produced and arranged the William Shatner album, Has Been (2004); he previously worked with Shatner on the songs \"In Love\" and \"Still in Love\" for Fear of Pop.\\n\\nFolds described his former band, Ben Folds Five, as \"punk rock for sissies,\" and his oddball lyrics often contain nuances of depression, melancholy and self-conflict. Folds also provided a number of songs for film soundtracks. Some of these include \"Lonely Christmas Eve\" for the Jim Carrey film How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (2000), and a rendition of the Beatles\\' \"Golden Slumbers\" for the film I Am Sam (2001). He (as The Bens) has also done charity compilations, from singing \"Wicked Little Town\" (from film and stage show Hedwig and the Angry Inch) on the benefit album \"Wig in a Box\" (2003) to appearing on No Boundaries, a benefit album for Kosovo refugees, with the song \"Leather Jacket.\" (written by Darren Jessee)\\n\\nOn a planned tour of Australia, Folds teamed up with solo artists Ben Kweller and Ben Lee to travel the country together as The Bens, at the suggestion of a fan on Ben Kweller\\'s official website. The trio also went on to record a four-track EP together, entitled The Bens.\\n\\nIn summer of 2004, Folds co-headlined an American tour with fellow rockers Rufus Wainwright and Guster. His second solo studio album, entitled Songs for Silverman, was released in the U.S. on April 26, 2005, featuring Jared Reynolds on bass, and Lindsay Jamieson on the drums, thus returning to the trio format, which had been so successful earlier, in earnest. This album includes the track \"Late,\" a tribute to the late singer-songwriter Elliott Smith, and also features backing vocals from \"Weird Al\" Yankovic on \"Time.\" (Folds had played piano for Yankovic\\'s song \"Why Does This Always Happen to Me?\" and \"Weird Al\" directed Folds\\' music video for Rockin\\' the Suburbs). In January of 2007 Lindsay Jamieson left the band and was replaced by Sam Smith, of The Comfies on drums.\\n\\nFolds performed with Rufus Wainwright and Ben Lee in the summer of 2005 as part of the \"Odd Men Out\" tour. In addition, Folds has performed with many other famous musical names, including Weezer. Folds has also shown the complexity behind his authentic sound by performing with the West Australian Symphony Orchestra, in March 2005, and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, in November 2005. A DVD recording of Folds playing with the West Australian Symphony Orchestra was released in December, 2005.\\n\\nFolds was the first artist to do a \"Live at Myspace\" concert, held on October 24, 2006 in his recording studio in Nashville, the show was an hour long and had requests from the internet submitted via Myspace\\'s Messenger. It also entailed several stunts, including a suicide attempt, and a falling audience member during \"Jesusland\". The DVD of the broadcast (almost whole) was released in February of 2007. \\n\\n\\nFolds supports the independent music scene, creating his own record label (Attacked By Plastic) and doing promotional work for independent record stores across the country.\\n\\nIn 2008, September 16 marked the release of Amanda Palmer\\'s solo album which was produced by Folds. Two days following that release, Ben Folds Five had a one-time reunion concert held in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, the same place the band was formed. Weeks later, he released his third solo album entitled Way To Normal, released on September 30. Folds also recorded a fake album that was leaked intentionally during the summer to please fans and in an attempt to stop the real album from leaking. The fake tracks were recorded and mixed over a period of only several days. The leak contained 6 fake songs with names similar to the real songs or the album, and three songs from the actual release (except the song Cologne, which was an orchestral version of a song by the same name on the final album).\\n\\nSince December 2008, Folds has been collaborating with English novelist Nick Hornby, writing the music while Hornby writes the lyrics. This album was originally planned to be recorded over a course of 3 days, the same amount of time in which the fake album was recorded, but Folds has since been recording the album in a more standard format, albeit attempting to retain the live recording format. He has also played several songs from the upcoming album at live shows since mid-2009, and the album is slated to be released on September 27th of 2010.\\n\\nFrom December 14 through 21, 2009, Folds was featured as a judge on NBC\\'s a cappella competition The Sing Off alongside Nicole Scherzinger and Shawn Stockman and offered insightful, constructive comments and criticisms to the contestants. On the final show, in a departure from his a cappella purism, showcased his talents and played the roaring, riffing piano background on \"Why Can\\'t We Be Friends?\" sung by the two finalist groups, Tufts Beelzebubs from Tufts University near Boston and Nota, from San Juan, Puerto Rico. He again returned for the show\\'s second season, and has been confirmed to return for the third season in September 2011 alongside Stockman and new judge Sara Bareilles.\\n\\nRecently Ben Folds was assumed to be the anonymous pianist playing songs to random ChatRoulette users, named \"Merton.\" Although Ben Folds has admitted to NOT being Merton, he paid tribute to the YouTube star at a concert in Charlotte in \"Ode To Merton.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ben+Folds\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Harper\\'s blend of groove-laden funky soul and folky handcrafted acoustics helped him to gain cult status during the course of the 1990s and widespread attention toward the end of the decade. Harper combines elements of classic folk singers, blues revivalists and jam bands and is embraced by critics and college kids alike. Harper\\'s body of work sells consistently and he tours constantly, building a solid, dedicated fan base.\\n\\nHarper began playing guitar as a child in his hometown of Claremont, California (in California\\'s Inland Empire).

After this limited edition record, Harper got a record deal with Virgin Records, who released his debut album, Welcome to the Cruel World (1994).\\n\\nThis was followed by the incendiary Fight For Your Mind (1995) which became a college radio favorite and generated an abundance of songs which still fill his set list to this day.\\nIn 1999 at the Santa Barbara Bowl, Harper met Jack Johnson, who was unknown at the time and had not recorded. Harper obtained a demo tape of 12 of Johnson\\'s songs that he forwarded to his producer, J.P. Plunier, with whom Johnson recorded his first album. \\n\\nFrom early on in his career, his music received more attention in Europe than it did in his home country. While he was a well-known and respected figure in the States, in countries like France, Germany, Switzerland, Portugal, and The Netherlands he was a star, receiving a great deal of airplay and critical acclaim.

Euromart made an EP and played club shows in Tulsa, but dissolved when the members left for college.\\n\\nAfter high school, Rector attended the University of Arkansas where he studied marketing. During his freshman year he recorded a self-titled EP that featured the song “Conversation”, which won the Grand Prize in the pop category of the John Lennon Songwriting Contest in 2006.  He is the youngest person ever to win the award for the pop category. The EP grew popular in surrounding states, and by his sophomore year, Rector began touring frequently on weekends and during breaks in the school year. In 2008 Rector released his first full-length record, Twenty Tomorrow, followed by Songs That Duke Wrote in 2009. In 2009 Rector was given the NAMA award for best singer songwriter in Northwest Arkansas.  During his college career at the University of Arkansas he played approximately 200 shows.\\n\\nIn June 2009 Rector moved to Nashville with his wife to pursue songwriting and to continue his career as an artist. On November 28, 2009 he released Jingles and Bells, a Christmas album composed of classic Christmas songs. Rector arranged the songs and played all the instruments on the album. He released his most recent album Into The Morning on February 16, 2010. Through word of mouth, the record peaked at #5 on the iTunes pop chart, #10 on the iTunes overall chart, and #11 on Billboard Heatseekers.[3] Immediately following the release, Rector co-headlined the “Three Amigos” tour throughout the eastern half of the United States with fellow Nashvillians Steve Moakler and Andrew Ripp. Later in the spring of 2010 he toured with both Dave Barnes and Five for Fighting.\\n\\nHis song “After All” was used in the June 15, 2010 episode of the ABC Family show Pretty Little Liars.\\n\\nAlbums\\nYear \\tTitle\\n2007 \\tTwenty Tomorrow\\n2008 \\tSongs That Duke Wrote\\n2010 \\tInto the Morning\\n2011      Something like This\\n\\nEPs\\nYear \\tTitle\\n2006 \\tBen Rector\\n2009 \\tJingles and Bells\\n\\nSingles\\nYear \\tTitle\\n2010 \\tSummer Candy <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ben+Rector\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He grew up in Cleveland, and dropped out of high school to pursue music full time in a local band, The Grasshoppers. Unlike many other musicians\\' families, his parents were both singers and actively supported his musical endeavors. He became proficient in several instruments including the guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, and drums. However, his talents in The Cars were mostly in playing the bass and lead vocals for several of their most popular hits, including \"Just What I Needed\", \"Let\\'s Go\", and \"Drive\".\\n\\nBy the mid 1970s Orr was working in a Boston night club band, Cap\\'n Swing, with other members including future Cars frontman Ric Ocasek and guitarist Elliot Easton. When the group broke up in 1975, the three of them joined up with the other two members to form The Cars by 1976.\\n\\nWith several top hits and multi-platinum albums under his belt for his work with The Cars, Orr in 1986 issued his only solo project, The Lace, where he co-wrote all music and lyrics, and it spawned one Top 40 hit, \"Stay The Night\". The album had a very familiar rhythm and feel of The Cars but was also free of Ocasek\\'s frequently cryptic lyrics.\\n\\nAfter the break up of The Cars, Orr as well as the other members pursued solo work. From 1995 he led three bands, including \\'Orr\\', \\'The Voices of Classic Rock\\', and \\'Big People\\'.\\n\\nIn April 2000 he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, yet continued to perform in concerts with his all-star band, Big People, at summer music festivals and state fairs.

       " 'Benny Goodman, born Benjamin David Goodman, (May 30, 1909 – June 13, 1986) was an American jazz musician, known as King of Swing, Patriarch of the Clarinet, The Professor, and Swing\\'s Senior Statesman.\\n\\nGoodman was regarded by some as a demanding taskmaster, by others an arrogant and eccentric martinet. Many musicians spoke of The Ray, Goodman\\'s trademark glare that he bestowed on a musician who failed to perform to his demanding standards. Anita O\\'Day and Helen Forrest spoke bitterly of their experiences singing with Goodman. \"The twenty or so months I spent with Benny felt like twenty years,\" said Forrest. \"When I look back, they seem like a life sentence.\" He could also be incredibly self-absorbed; it is reported that when eating an egg onto which a ketchup bottle cap had fallen, Goodman simply ate around it. At the same time, there are reports that he privately funded several college educations and was sometimes very generous, though always secretly. When a friend asked him why one time, he reportedly said, \"Well, if they knew about it, everyone would come to me with their hand out.\"\\n\\nSome suggest that Elvis Presley had the same success with rock and roll that Goodman achieved with jazz and swing. Without Goodman there would not have been a swing era. It is true that many of Goodman\\'s arrangements had been played for years before by Fletcher Henderson\\'s orchestra. While Goodman publicly acknowledged his debt to Henderson, many young white swing fans had never heard Henderson\\'s band. While most consider Goodman a jazz innovator, others maintain his main strength was his perfectionism and drive. Goodman was a non - pariel virtuoso clarinetist and  -along with only Artie Shaw,  amongst the most technically proficient jazz clarinetists of all time.\\n\\nGoodman is also responsible for a significant step in racial integration in America. In the early 1930s, black and white jazz musicians could not play together in most clubs or concerts. In the Southern states, racial segregation was enforced by the Jim Crow laws. Benny Goodman broke with tradition by hiring Teddy Wilson to play with him ] in the Autumn of 1936. He then added Lionel Hampton on vibes in December, 1936, and  in the early Summer of 1939 he augmented the famous \"quartette\"  with pioneering jazz guitarist Charlie Christian to his band and small ensembles, who played with him until his untimely death from tuberculosis less than three years later. To give an understanding of American history at this time, Goodman\\'s integration of popular music happened ten years before Jackie Robinson entered Major League Baseball. \"[Goodman\\'s] popularity was such that he could remain financially viable without touring the South, where he would have been subject to arrest for violating Jim Crow laws.\"  By the  mid- Summer of 1941, Benny had hired the incomparably rhythmic and show-man drummer, legendary \"Big Sid\" Catlett,  the (later) famous John Simmons on bass, and still possessed the incomparable Charlie Christian on electric guitar   -plus Cootie Williams was in the middle of his one-year contract...  This amounted to  virtually one-quarter of the orchestra of black heritage, but of course  -following Jimmy Munday and Fletcher Henderson (who also joined the band as pianist for 6 months in July, 1939) it was really an orchestrated white extension of black big band jazz  -only, curiously  -better. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Benny+Goodman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

December 7, 1924 - d. 28 July 2020) —better known for many years as Bent Fabric—is a Danish jazz and pop pianist and composer whose long career spanning numerous genres, and spare, lyric piano style, has often been overshadowed by his longtime signature composition and hit, the 1962 instrumental \"Alley Cat.\"\\n\\nThis simple, unpretentious, jazz-oriented dance song became an international hit and earned Fabric an American Grammy award in 1963 as well as a best-selling album under the same name. \"Alley Cat\" also became a constant at scores of formal dance receptions such as weddings, Sweet Sixteens, Bar Mitzvahs, and others for years afterward---so much so that, within only a few years of the song\\'s original appearance, almost nobody hearing it (or joining in the novel dance created for it) could identify who wrote and recorded the song in the first place, never mind distinguish Fabric\\'s unadorned quartet (piano, guitar, upright bass, and percussion) from the numerous versions played at such affairs. Numerous enough that the song eventually became a kind of tacky joke as popular music tastes and attitudes changed.\\n\\nThat was almost unfair to Fabric, whose melodic flair and unflashy style helped him create a fine series of jazz-pop instrumental recordings in the early-to-mid 1960s (including a memorable collaboration with British clarinetist and jazz titan Mr. Acker Bilk). These included The Happy Puppy, Organ Grinder\\'s Swing, Drunken Penguin, Never Tease Tigers, Operation Lovebirds, and Relaxing with Bent Fabric.\\n\\nHe later composed scores for countless Danish movies and TV series under his given name, including Matador and Olsenbanden, as well as for the Danish Royal Ballet.

       " 'Benzino (born Raymond Scott in 1964) is a rapper and former CEO and co-owner of The Source, a popular hip hop magazine in the United States. Originally from Boston, Massachusetts, Benzino met The Source founder Dave Mays while attending Harvard University. From 1988 to 2001, Benzino was a silent partner in the growth of the business. However, in 2001, Benzino acknowledged his involvement in the publication.\\n\\nAs a rapper, Benzino\\'s career has been relatively unsuccessful, compared to many of the artists featured in his magazine. Though known for his run-ins with the police, Benzino is most famous for his on-going feud with rapper Eminem, and more recently hip hop group Slaughterhouse.\\n\\nBenzino\\'s impact on The Source\\n\\nBenzino started his rap career with a group called the Almighty RSO. The group was known mainly for their anti-police song \"One In The Chamba\" from the Forever Doomsday album released through Tommy Boy Records. The single and album were considered controversial for the tone of the rap group and encouraging the murder of local law enforcement. In 1994 The Boston Police and the Fraternal Order of Police union had placed the group on high priority at the time forcing RSO to be dropped from the label. Benzino went on to record with rappers Antonio Twice Thou and Mr. Gzus, to form Made Men.\\n\\nSince Dave Mays was a friend and manager of the group, he would frequently insert stories and reviews into The Source without the consent of the editors. Benzino also secretly inserted favorable coverage and advertising. In 1994 and 1999, Mays slipped in articles on Benzino\\'s group forcing a majority of the staff to walkout in protest. After an article in GQ Magazine criticized Mays\\' decision on working with Benzino, it forced scrunity on the rapper and the publication. Editors claimed that Benzino and his associates visited the magazine, threatening journalists and stealing property. Benzino was arrested in a dispute with law enforcement in Miami in 2001. After publicizing the incident, Benzino became co-owner of the magazine, forcing out the original founders of The Source. When the publication held its annual awards, Benzino was nominated for awards even though his music is rarely seen or heard in the media. Industry insiders believe that Benzino was involved in rating albums. Therefore his role as the \"five-mic giver\" has been well recognized in the pages of the publication.\\n\\nAfter acknowledging his position as co-ownerof The Source, he recorded a solo album. Benzino was signed to Motown Records and released The Benzino Project. The debut album featured many notable rappers, and also Pink. However, the album sold poorly, causing Motown to drop him from their label. The remains of the album was turned into a remix album featuring the same artists and a few different beats. Tarnished but undeterred, Benzino released his sophomore album under Elektra Records.\\n\\nThe Feud With Eminem\\n\\nBenzino decided to air out his concerns with white multi-platinum Eminem. The rapper claims that Eminem\\'s success ruins blacks and Latino rappers\\' chances of success. Benzino believes that corporations are controlling and supporting Eminem, which allows him talk about meaningful topics, while black rappers must rap about materialistic things.\\n\\nOne possible contributing factor for Benzino\\'s concerns was Eminem\\'s rating for his album The Marshall Mathers LP. Originally, The Source had given Eminem a two mics (star rating) for his album which was received poorly by the readership, so it was later changed to a four mic rating. Meanwhile, Benzino\\'s Made Men was rated four-and-a-half mics. Eminem was upset and addressed the magazine on his follow-up album The Eminem Show.\\n\\nBenzino claims that MTV is also partly responsible for the problems of hip hop. Executives at the MTV Video Music Awards allowed Eminem to show up with over 100 blonde clones dressed like him marching on stage for their 2000 awards show. Benzino also singled out Interscope\\'s Jimmy Iovine for Eminem\\'s rise to stardom. One thing that most angered Benzino was a rap Eminem made on \"Without Me,\" one of his singles from The Eminem Show: “Though I\\'m not the first king of controversy/ I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley/ To do Black music so selfishly/ and use it to make myself wealthy\" (although in the context of the song, it was not likely a comment intended to be taken seriously). Benzino considered this the last straw.\\n\\nBefore Benzino released his album, he recorded a \"diss\" record mixtape addressed to Eminem. In some of his interviews he has stated that Eminem is a part of the corporate \"machine\" and it is destroying hip hop. Eminem caught wind of Benzino’s comments and decided to respond. Eminem recorded two vicious tracks, attacking the credibility of The Source and the rap career of Benzino.\\n\\nNot to be outdone by Eminem, Benzino threw out the claims of a corporate takeover and started to insult Eminem personally. He recorded a response to Eminem’s lyrical attacks by threatening his daughter and dubbing him the “2003 Vanilla Ice” and “Rap Hitler.” Eminem, fed up with this decided to air it out on radio. DJ personality Angie Martinez allowed Eminem to express his problems, in which Eminem branded Benzino as the “worst rapper in the world”. Benzino phoned in later, threatening to fight Eminem if they crossed paths. Elektra Records dropped Benzino, even before his sophomore album was ever released. Benzino\\'s album Redemption sold 14,000 units, a major disappointment compared to his rival\\'s album, The Eminem Show, selling over 4 million copies.\\n\\nBenzino has also been the subject of scrutiny for using his magazine as a personal promotional platform as well as a tool against his enemies. In 2003, The Source released recordings of Eminem which included derogatory references to Blacks and women. Eminem apologized for making the tapes but also stated The Source\\'s vendetta against him were the reasons for the allegations. The recordings, made in 1988, were the subject of a lawsuit from the rapper [1]. Eminem sued The Source for defamation and copyright infringement. The federal courts allowed an injunction to distribute a minimal amount of lyrics of the alleged tape. Benzino and the publication ignored the injunction and went forth to publish the entire lyrics on its website and in its magazine. By ignoring the injunction, The Source was found in contempt of court and were forced to pay Eminem and his label, Shady Records, a large compensation sum.\\n\\nBenzino and The Source urged video stations to ban Eminem\\'s video, \"Just Lose It\", and urged to have the song removed from Eminem\\'s album, because of the video\\'s depiction of Michael Jackson. In spite of their efforts, BET has been the only network to ban the video. Currently Eminem and Benzino continue to feud on albums, despite Eminem\\'s plead to end the dispute with The Source, through the single \"Like Toy Soldiers\" from Encore) . Benzino responded with his \"diss\" record \"Look Into My Eyes\". The song\\'s video parodies Eminem for being scared of Benzino, and for being willing to give up the rap game in order not to see the death of Eminem\\'s friend Proof.\\n\\nAt one time, the two were willing to sit down together and settle their differences. But that was halted after a confrontation between Eminem and co-founder David Mays. They got into a heated dispute, causing Benzino to reignite the argument. There were numerous reports that Benzino had influenced editors to write a critical piece about 50 Cent and G-Unit after a comment was made by members of the group. The situation is unclear, but the magaqzine is once again attacking Eminem and his Shady Records. After the magazine was printed, Benzino and Mays were criticized for allowing their vendetta against Interscope ruin the credibility of The Source. The issue addresses the controversy surrounding Hot 97 personality Funkmaster Flex and rappers associated to Eminem and 50 Cent.\\n\\nThe Call For Benzino\\'s Resignation\\n\\nAfter fans and supporters of Eminem called for the removal of the rapper from the publication, Benzino formally resigned from his position as co-owner of The Source [2]. The rapper decided to leave the magazine due to the controversy surrounding his involvement, citing a dispute between the publishers of Black Enterprises, as well as Eminem contributing to his resignation. The departure was short-lived. Benzino soon returned to his former position at The Source saying that his reason for leaving had been to prevent the firing of Def Jam president L.A. Reid. Benzino placed the blame on Interscope chairman Jimmy Iovine as well as Russell Simmons for pressuring Reid to remove Def Jam advertising from The Source. Insiders from The Source claimed that Benzino as well as Mays were part of a publicity stunt to encourage advertising in the magazine [3]. The owners wanted information to be leaked out so they can ease the advertisers\\' worries about associating with The Source.\\n\\nAfter returning to the publication, Benzino was sued with multiple lawsuits. Former editor-in-chief Kim Osorio, and many female workers filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit against Benzino and The Source for sexual harassment and gender discrimination. After a taping of the previous Source Awards, Benzino was dealt numerous lawsuits for unpaid expenses and missing jewelry after he and Mays had invited their families to the award shows [4]. While filming a music video down in the Dominican Republic, the staff at The Source held another walkout. The Source\\'s staff were upset about having received non-clearing paychecks with no response from senior management. Benzino\\'s latest album, Arch-Nemesis, was released quietly in 2005 and has sold 10,000 units to date. Two of the Source\\'s top music executives from Boston have been accused of a nightclub shooting in New York. Leroy Peebles and Alvin Chiles were both accused of the shooting that resulted in three people hospitalized.\\n\\nThe current editor-in-chief Joshua \"Fahyim\" Ratcliffe, has recently left the magazine. Ratcliffe stated that a conflict of interest between the rating of highly acclaimed The Minstrel Show from rap group Little Brother was changed after threats to him by Benzino. Ratcliffe felt that Benzino\\'s jealousy of any group deserving a five star rating is too much. Ratcliffe resigned after being forced to change the rating of the album. Lil\\' Kim who released The Naked Truth received the five mic rating instead. Although critics speculated that Lil\\' Kim\\'s manager is currently Dave Mays, this is the first time that a female rapper ever received the highest rating in the magazine. The Little Brother album received a four-and-a-half mic rating instead of a five.\\n\\nIn 2006, the shareholders of The Source Magazine officially terminated co-founder Mays and Benzino after their controversal actions ruined the reputation of the publication. Benzino tried to avert the termination by obtaining a temporary restraining order to prevent him from losing his post as chief brand executive and president. After the restraining order was lifted, the shareholders formally dismissed Mays and Benzino. Former writer and editor Jeremy Miller officially became CEO of The Source. It\\'s not clear if Benzino will continue to influence the magazine but it\\'s certain that the situation the rapper is facing may lead to a more negative perception of the publication.\\n\\nAlmighty RSO- Doomsday: Forever RSO (1992?)^\\nMade Men- Classic Limited Edition (1998)^\\nThe Benzino Project (2001)^\\nThe Benzino Remix Project (2002)\\nRedemption (2003)\\nArch-Nemesis (2005)\\n\\n^It\\'s noted that these albums are no longer found in retailers. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Benzino\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He’s classically trained, but it’s his love for jazz that has him motivated to create. “I’m able to play any song I like on the radio,” says the Paris native who also calls the Republic of Georgia home.

       " 'Like his great great grandfather, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the German poet who penned \"Faust\", Bertie Higgins is a storyteller. He was born Elbert Joseph Higgins of Portuguese, Irish and German descent and raised in the picturesque Greek community of Tarpon Springs, Florida. Bertie is an intellectual romantic who loves to paint story songs about living and loving in a tropical paradise.\\n\\nHis love songs explore the efforts of man trying to fathom the mystery and allure of woman. His fantasy songs deal with the beauty and sensuality of the tropics and his story songs combine past experiences and future hopes. The resounding theme throughout Bertie\\'s work: \"Make the best of today lest tomorrow never comes\".\\n\\nBertie, who once supported himself as a sponge diver, began his career in show business at the age of twelve as a ventriloquist. He won top prizes in local talent contests and became a favorite at school assemblies and clubs around Tampa Bay. Two years later, a battered set of drums forced a career change and Bertie set off to follow the back beat heard around the world -- Rock and Roll.\\n\\nHis first band played proms, homecoming dances and sock hops. After graduating Tarpon Springs High School, Bertie enrolled in St. Petersburg Junior College to study journalism and fine art, but the music continued to sing in his heart. He eventually left college and became drummer for the Tommy Roe band (Sheila, Dizzy), The Roemans, During this period, the band toured the world, opening shows for the likes of the Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys, Tom Jones, Roy Orbison, Manfred Mann, Peter and Gordon, The Dave Clark Five and many more. At the height of Beatlemania, Bertie was playing with and learning from the best.\\n\\nTiring of the rigors of the road and yearning to make his own musical statement, Bertie left The Roemans and returned home to Florida. He put down his drumsticks, picked up a guitar and began crafting music and lyrics. It was a time of great satisfaction and personal release. Producers such as Bob Crewe (The Four Seasons), Phil Gernhard (Lobo), and Felton Jarvis (Elvis) took an interest and contributed to the growth of the young songwriter. Bertie\\'s talent flourished and he was in demand to play venues throughout the state.\\n\\nGordon Lightfoot, Cat Stevens and Jimmy Buffet were Bertie\\'s primary sources of inspiration and he remains friends with Gordon and Jimmy today. During this period, he also met and became a protege of the late actor/director, Richard Boone, who saw Bertie\\'s writing potential and tutored him in screen writing.\\n\\nIn 1980, Bertie moved to Atlanta and met record producer, Sonny Limbo. Sonny had played a role in developing the group Alabama and had been instrumental in the careers of several others. He arranged that fateful meeting between Bertie and music publisher, Bill Lowery, whom Bertie had known through Tommy Roe. The meeting of these three was destiny waiting to happen.\\n\\nBertie had been working on a song about a personal failed romance. He presented the rough cut to Bill and Sonny. They helped him perfect the lyrics of the song that became Key Largo. Bertie recorded the master and presented it to Kat Family records, a newly formed CBS distributing company. At first they rejected it. After persistent badgering by Bertie, Bill and Sonny, Kat Family finally agreed to release the single in 1981 and pop music history was made.\\n\\nKey Largo blew a hole in the U.S. charts. When it reached number one in the nation, the world took notice and it went on to become an international hit. Other hit singles followed like Just Another Day in Paradise, Casablanca and Pirates and Poets. Casablanca became Song Of The Year in all of the pacific rim and the album hit double platinum. Bertie Higgins became an international recording star literally overnight.\\n\\nFor the past several years, Bertie and his excellent group, \"The Band of Pirates\" have toured extensively around the globe. He has received rave reviews and accolades from the music industry and his fans alike. He is named in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland and displayed in the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in Macon. Besides being the consummate stage performer, songwriter and vocalist, he is an accomplished screenwriter/novelist and actor. Bertie has owned a successful restaurant in the Florida Keys, written music for David Letterman, Burt Reynolds and many others. He has made numerous TV talk show and music variety show appearances around the world and continues to be invited back again and again. Besides maintaining a rigorous schedule of one-nighters, he also makes regular appearances on the fabulous Las Vegas strip. \\n\\nBertie seriously supports several national charity organizations. Hospice, The American Cancer Society, The Boys and Girls Clubs of America are just a few. He regularly makes appearances and participates in several charitable national golf tournaments and donates his time and talent. He lives by the credo \"you must give some back\", and takes the commitment very seriously.\\n\\nAn ongoing project in his homestate of Florida is the preservation of fragile endangered wildlife, particularily the brown pelican and other sea birds. He works closely with zoologist, Ralph Heath of the Suncoast Seabird Sanctuary in Redington Shores, FL, and has organized and performed at several fund raisers to benefit that great organization. He has also been actively involved in preserving Florida\\'s rapidly deteriorating lighthouses and was instrumental in helping restore the one on Anclote Key near his hometown of Tarpon Springs. \\n\\nBertie is the father of three boys and one girl, and lives with two of his sons, Julian and Aaron in Burbank, CA. His eldest son, Damian, a graduate of the University of Pittsburgh, is a world renowned recording artist in his own right. He has attained a great deal of success under the pseudonym, \"Diesel Boy\" and is currently working on his ninth CD release. One of the top junglist D.J.\\'s on the globe, he performs regularly from London, Cape Town, Budapest, Hong Kong, New York and all points in between. He has graced the cover of several national magazine publications and Bertie couldn\\'t be a prouder Dad. Julian is a college sophomore attending film school in Hollywood learning to direct movies; Aaron is a senior at Burbank High and Kimberly holds a position with Southwest Air, the greatest airline in the world. Bertie is also the proud grandfather of Eli William Dauser, Kimberly\\'s young son.\\n\\nBertie personally manages his international fan club, \"The Boneheads\" and he is endeared to each and every member. He truly believes that they are just the greatest group of people in the world and hovers over them with a watchful, caring eye. Once annually they fly into Florida from around the world to participate in their \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" cruise. Always a seven day adventure with a major cruise line, they hang out, party, explore the Caribbean and meet \\'n\\' greet each other. \\'Tis always a pillage and plunder and the next one is soon forthcoming. \\n\\nTo be certain, it will always be just another day in paradise for Bertie Higgins and he\\'ll be waiting for you under the next palm tree for years to come.

A total of three further singles including a reissue of \"Cry to Me\" were released on Jubilee, also produced by Bert Berns, with \"His Kiss\", which was released on January 4, 1964, another deep soul ballad, reaching the lower part of the Billboard Pop and R&B charts.\\n\\nIn 1964, Betty Harris switched record labels to Sansu, a New Orleans label, where she was produced by Allen Toussaint. Her recording with Sansu produced ten singles. Of those, only \"Nearer to You\", an atmospheric, dramatic soul ballad, now considered one of the milestones of deep soul, achieved U.S. national chart success (Billboard number 85). However, practically all of her recordings for Sansu, uptempo tunes and ballads alike, featuring Toussaint\\'s raw yet sophisticated Southern soul arrangements behind Harris\\' rich, distinctive vocal, are considered prime specimens of the classic soul era; some notable recordings were \"I\\'m Evil Tonight\", a beat ballad favored in Northern soul circles; \"I Don\\'t Want to Hear It\", \"Show it\" and \"Twelve Red Roses\", stirring up-tempo tracks; \"Can\\'t Last Much Longer\" and \"What\\'d I Do Wrong\", emotive deep soul ballads.\\n\\nHarris retired from performing in 1970 to raise a family.\\nAll of the Sansu recordings were compiled into an album released in the UK (but not the US) in 1969, called Soul Perfection, an album which, in its vinyl format, although not extremely rare, commands relatively high prices of $200 to $300 today.\\n\\nA comprehensive CD compilation of Harris recordings, titled Soul Perfection Plus, was released in 1999 by the UK re-release label, West Side.\\n\\nIn 2005, Harris returned to the music industry after a long absence.\\n\\nShe has made several public appearances in the US and Europe, including the 2007 Porretta Soul Festival in Italy, and has recorded a new album, Intuition.\\n\\nHarris toured Australia in 2006 and appeared on the TV show RocKwiz, where she performed \"Cry to Me\", and a duet of \"Love Lots Of Lovin\\'\" with the Australian singer John Paul Young.\\n\\nDiscography\\n\\nUS singles\\n\\n1962\\t\"Taking Care of Business\"\\t\"Yesterday\\'s Kisses\"\\tDouglas\\t104\\n1963\\t\"Cry to Me\"\\t\"I\\'ll Be A Liar\"\\tJubilee\\t5456\\n1964\\t\"His Kiss\"\\t\"It\\'s Dark Outside\"\\tJubilee\\t5465\\n1964\\t\"Mojo Hannah\"\\t\"Now Is The Hour\"\\tJubilee\\t5480\\n1965\\t\"What A Sad Feeling\"\\t\"I\\'m Evil Tonight\"\\tSansu\\t450\\n1966\\t\"I Don\\'t Want to Hear It\"\\t\"Sometime\"\\tSansu\\t452\\n1966\\t\"Twelve Red Roses\"\\t\"What\\'d I Do Wrong\"\\tSansu\\t455\\n1967\\t\"Lonely Hearts\"\\t\"Bad Luck\"\\tSansu\\t461\\n1967\\t\"Nearer to You\"\\t\"I\\'m Evil Tonight\"\\tSansu\\t466\\n1967\\t\"Can\\'t Last Much Longer\"\\t\"I\\'m Gonna Git Ya\"\\tSansu\\t471\\n1968\\t\"Love Lots of Lovin\\'\"\\t\"Take Care of Our Love\"\\n(with Lee Dorsey)\\tSansu\\t474\\n1968\\t\"What\\'d I Do Wrong\"\\t\"Mean Man\"\\tSansu\\t478\\n1968\\t\"Hook Line \\'N\\' Sinker\"\\t\"Show It\"\\tSansu\\t479\\n1968\\t\"Ride Your Pony\"\\t\"Trouble With My Lover\"\\tSansu\\t480\\n1969\\t\"There\\'s A Break in The Road\"\\t\"All I Want Is You\"\\tSSS International\\t766\\n\\nAlbums\\n\\n2007\\tIntuition\\tEvidence\\n\\n\\nVinyl compilations\\n\\n1969\\tSoul Perfection\\tAction (UK)\\tACLP 6007\\n1980\\tIn The Saddle\\tCharly (UK)\\tCRB 1002\\n[12]\\n\\nCompilation CD\\n\\n1999\\tSoul Perfection Plus\\tWest Side (UK)\\tWESA 807\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Betty+Harris\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Bessie Regina Norris (born December 21, 1953 - died May 10, 2020), better known professionally as Betty Wright, was an American soul and R&B singer, songwriter and background vocalist born in Miami, Florida, who rose to fame in the 1970s with hits such as \"Clean Up Woman\" and \"Tonight is the Night\". Wright was also prominent in regard to the use of whistle register, the highest human singing register. She influenced a generation of female singer-songwriters and also influenced the world of hip hop who sampled some of her more popular material.\\n\\nStarting singing gospel with the family group, the Echoes of Joy, Wright began switching to R&B music in 1965 when she was only 11. In 1968, she released her first album, My First Time Around, at the age of 15, and scored her first hit, \"Girls Can\\'t Do What Guys Can Do\". \\n\\nIt was not until the end of 1971 that Wright\\'s most successful phase of her career took place. The song, \"Clean Up Woman\", became a Top 5 pop and R&B hit, and would later influence a remix of Mary J. Blige\\'s \"Real Love\" single with the sample of its guitar riffs; R&B girl group trio SWV\\'s \"I\\'m So Into You\" also featured a sample from \"Clean Up Woman\", as did Afrika Bambaataa\\'s song \"Zulu War Chant\". In 1974, Wright scored big with the songs \"Tonight is the Night\" (about a real-life love affair that happened with Wright when she was a teenager) and \"Where is the Love\" (which won her a Grammy for Best R&B Song).\\n\\nAfter experiencing a brief slump in the early 1980s, she rebounded founding her own record label, Ms. B Records, and in 1988 made music history by being the first woman to have a gold record on her own label, with the release of Mother Wit, which featured two of her biggest hits in years, \"No Pain (No Gain)\" and the \"After The Pain\". On both songs, Wright displays her powerful upper register capabilities and five-octave range. In 1989, Wright released 4u2njoy which features the hit songs \"From Pain To Joy\", \"Quiet Storm\" and \"Keep Love New\". Her subsequent albums Passion and Compassion, B-Attitudes and Fit For A King kept her fanbase satisfied.\\n\\nBy 2001, a compilation album, The Very Best of Betty Wright, was released. In 2007, Wright scored her most successful single in over a decade with \"Baby\", a duet with fellow Soul singer, Angie Stone. The song peaked at #22 on the R&B chart and #2 on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart.\\n\\nWright mentored several young singers, and did vocal production for the likes of Gloria Estefan, Jennifer Lopez and Joss Stone.  \\n\\nIn December 2010, Wright was given another Grammy Award nomination for the song, \"Go\", for the Best Traditional R&B Vocal Performance. \\n\\nIn January 2011, Wright released her first album in ten years, Betty Wright: The Movie, and was credited to Betty Wright & The Roots . \\n\\nOn May 10, 2020, Wright sadly passed away due to cancer at age 66. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Betty+Wright\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Bettye Swann (born Betty Jean Champion, October 24, 1944, Shreveport, Louisiana) is an American soul music singer, best known for her 1967 hit song \"Make Me Yours\".\\n\\nShe grew up in Arcadia, Louisiana, one of 14 children, and moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1963. Although some sources state that she was in a vocal group known as The Fawns who recorded for Money Records in 1964, she has refuted this, saying that she sang with a trio in Arcadia by that name.\\nIn 1964 she started a solo singing career, as Bettye Swann, at the prompting of local DJ Al Scott, who became her manager. After a minor hit with the self-penned \"Don’t Wait Too Long\". her big breakthrough came with \"Make Me Yours\", which topped the Billboard R&B charts in July 1967, and also made #21 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 1968 she split with Scott, moved to Georgia, won a new contract with Capitol Records and had another hit in 1969 with \"Don\\'t Touch Me\" (#14 R&B, #38 Hot 100).\\nIn 1972 she transferred to Atlantic Records and had a couple of minor hits with \"Victim of a Foolish Heart\" (later revived by Joss Stone), and Merle Haggard’s \"Today I Started Loving You Again\". She continued to record until the mid-1970s, but with little commercial success. Her last public performance as Bettye Swann was in 2013, live in Cleethorpes.\\nAs Betty Barton, she then worked in the education sector in the Las Vegas, Nevada area, and became a Jehovah\\'s Witness. She is now retired and, according to a 2005 interview, suffers from a degenerative spinal condition.

       " 'Beverley Knight MBE (born 22 March 1972), born Beverley Ann Smith, is a critically acclaimed British soul singer, songwriter and record producer who released her debut album in 1995. Heavily influenced by soul greats such as Sam Cooke and Aretha Franklin, Knight has released five studio albums and one compilation collection to date. Widely labelled as one of Britain\\'s greatest soul singers, Knight is best known for her hit singles \"Greatest Day\", \"Shoulda Woulda Coulda\" and \"Come As You Are\" and \"Made It Back\". After a decade in the industry, she was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Urban Music Awards in 2004.\\n\\nIn 2006 Knight starred in BBC1 music TV show, Just The Two Of Us, and is the host of the Radio 2 show Beverley\\'s Gospel Nights, which explores the origins and impact of gospel music. Now in its second season, the show has featured interviews with stars such as Destiny\\'s Child and Shirley Caesar.\\n\\nKnight is an ambassador for many charities such Christian Aid and has travelled to areas affected by disease and poverty to help raise awareness. She is an active campaigner for anti-Aids organisations such as the Stop AIDS Campaign and The Terrence Higgins Trust and is also a vocal campaigner against homophobic lyrics in urban music. She became an MBE in 2006, the only musician to be granted such an honour in the Queen\\'s eightieth birthday honours list. \\n\\nIn February 2006 Knight consolidated her move into the mainstream audience by appearing on BBC1 music show, Just The Two of Us. The show, featuring celebrities who duet with established singers, ran for two weeks and proved to be a relative disappointment in terms of audience figures – averaging between fifteen and twenty-five percent audience shares.[17] Nevertheless it provided a platform for Knight to reach out to a bigger audience and demonstrate her talent by performing a different array of songs than she would otherwise be known for. Reaching out to new audiences was also a driving force behind Knight’s decision to join Take That on their reunion arena tour. Take That - The Ultimate Tour 06, which ran from April to July 2006, sold 270,000 tickets in less than four hours on sale at the box office and featured Knight as a support act.\\n\\nIn March 2006 Beverley released her fifth album, a compilation set featuring the majority of her top forty UK singles entitled Voice - The Best Of Beverley Knight. The album, which was certified Gold less than a month after its release,[19] became her second highest charting of her career when it entered the UK albums chart at number ten and rose to number nine a month later. It was preceded by the single \"Piece of my Heart\" – a cover of the Erma Franklin classic made famous by Janis Joplin and entered the singles chart at number sixteen, spending eleven weeks inside the UK top 75 singles chart and becoming her longest-running chart single to date.\\n\\nIn October 2006, Knight recorded her fifth studio album, Music City Soul, in Nashville. Completed in less than five days, the album was released on 7 May 2007 and features collaborations with musicians such as Ronnie Wood and Scotty Moore. It has spawned three singles thus far, \"No Man\\'s Land\", released on 16 April 2007, \"After You\", released on 2 July 2007 and \"The Queen of Starting Over\", released on 15 October 2007.\\n\\nBeverley will be releasing her next album in spring 2009.\\n\\nSites: YouTube <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Beverley+Knight\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Christopher Lee Rios (November 9, 1971 - February 7, 2000), better known as Big Pun or Big Punisher, was a Puerto Rican American rapper who emerged from the underground rap scene in The Bronx in the late 1990s. He first appeared on albums from The Beatnuts on the track \"Off the Books\" and on Fat Joe\\'s second album in 1995, Jealous One\\'s Envy, on the track \"Watch Out\", prior to signing to Loud Records as a solo artist. Big Pun\\'s career was cut short in 2000 at age 28 by a fatal heart attack due to his obesity. He is survived by a wife, Liza Rios, and three children. Big Pun was the first solo Latino rapper to sell over one million LPs. His first stage name was Big Moon Dawg. His name comes from the Marvel comic book anti-hero The Punisher.\\n\\n Born in the Bronx during the early years of hip-hop, Christopher Rios grew up in an athletic tradition, enjoying basketball, boxing, and other sports. At the age of five, he broke his leg in a Manhattan municipal park, which would later (after several minimum wage jobs in New York and Miami, where he briefly relocated) net him a settlement from the city, to the tune of $500,000. At the age of 15, Pun dropped out of Stevenson High School. Sometime during the \\'80s, Rios began to write rap lyrics, forming the Full A Clips Crew with Triple Seis, Cuban Link, and Prospect. After meeting fellow Puerto Rican and Bronx rapper Fat Joe, in 1995, Pun became increasingly associated with him, making his commercial debut on Fat Joe\\'s second album, Jealous Ones Envy (J.O.E.).\\n\\n After an advertising blitz, \"I\\'m Not a Player\" (featuring an O\\'Jays sample) was an underground hit. The song\\'s remix, \"Still Not a Player\" (featuring Joe), became Big Pun\\'s first major mainstream hit. His full-length debut, Capital Punishment, followed in 1998, and was the first album by a Latino rapper (and a Latino solo artist) to go platinum. Around this time, Big Pun became a member of The Terror Squad, a New-York-based group of Latino rappers founded by Fat Joe, with most of the roster supplied by the now-defunct Full A Clips Crew.\\n\\n Big Pun was also a member of the Digging in the Crates Crew, alongside Fat Joe and various New York hip-hop legends such as Diamond D, Lord Finesse, Big L, and O.C.\\n\\n Due to issues with his broken leg and drug abuse, Pun\\'s health declined during these years. The once-athletic man struggled with overeating problems and weight issues for several years, his weight bounding between 450 and 700 pounds (200 and 300 kg). Though he checked into a North Carolina weight loss clinic and lost 80 pounds (35 kg), the final effort was not enough to save Pun\\'s health. At the age of 28, on February 7, 2000, Big Pun died of a heart attack at 700 lbs. (300 kg).\\n\\n Big Pun\\'s second album, Yeeeah Baby, was already scheduled to be released at the time of his death, and was issued in March 2000. A second posthumous album, Endangered Species, was released in 2001, a collection of \"greatest hits,\" new material, guest appearances, and remixed \"greatest verses.\"\\n\\n Pun\\'s supporters generally praise him for his complex rhyme schemes, intricate wordplay, ability to stay on-beat, and relentless flow and breath control (despite his immense size, which would generally render his complex phrasing too difficult).  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Big+Punisher\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album\\'s production was primarily handled by No I.D., and Key Wane along with additional production from Hit-Boy, Da Internz, Mike Dean, Travis Scott, Xaphoon Jones, and Young Chop among others. Big Sean also stated in an interview that he was in the studio with fellow Detroit native Eminem. Sean went on to say they made a \"Detroit classic\" but he is unsure if it will be on Hall of Fame because of \"timing issues\". Hall of Fame spawned five singles, \"Guap\", \"Switch Up\" featuring Common, \"Beware\" featuring Jhené Aiko and Lil Wayne, \"Fire\", and \"Ashley\" featuring Miguel.\\n\\nA month prior to the release of Hall of Fame, Big Sean told Complex that he had already begun work on his third album due to the inspiration from his new relationship.

During the same year, the foundation donated a recording studio for students at Big Sean\\'s alma mater, Cass Technical High School. Beginning in 2018, the foundation has hosted an annual weekend festival, called D.O.N. Weekend, with free events and performances for Detroit residents and usually by Detroit artists. In December 2018, Big Sean in partnership with Ally Financial, Thurgood Marshall College Fund & the Sean Anderson Foundation, created an annual scholarship competition for HBCU students called “Moguls in the Making.”\\n\\nOn March 25, 2016, Big Sean released a track to celebrate his 28th birthday, \"Get My Shit Together\". Two days later he announced a self-titled album with Jhené Aiko, Twenty88, scheduled to be released on April 1, 2016, exclusively on Tidal. The album was released on April 5, 2016, on Apple Music and Spotify. A week after the exclusive release of Twenty88 on Tidal, Big Sean and Aiko released a 15-minute short film called Out of Love, which is composed of several recordings from the album. Around the same month, upon the wake of the Flint water crisis, Big Sean tweeted to the city\\'s official Twitter account, asking if he could do anything to help, and later on donated $10,000.\\n\\nOn October 31, 2016, Big Sean released \"Bounce Back\" as the lead single from his fourth studio album, I Decided, which was released on February 3, 2017. \"Moves\" was released as an instant-great on December 16, 2016.

Music label, saying \"That\\'s a forever brotherhood, but business-wise, I had to start getting a bigger cut! I worked my way out that deal.\" West also claimed during a November 2021 Drink Champs podcast that signing Sean was the \\'worst decision\\' of his entire career.\\n\\nStarting in 2020, Big Sean has appeared in the Showtime series \\'Twenties\\' in a recurring role as Trsitan, an anti-social media character who learns the value of online connection.

       " 'Calvin Cordozar Broadus, Jr. (born October 20, 1971), known professionally as Snoop Dogg, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, television personality and actor. His music career began in 1992 when he was discovered by Dr. Dre and featured on Dre\\'s solo debut, \"Deep Cover\", and then on Dre\\'s solo debut album, The Chronic. He has since sold over 23 million albums in the United States and 35 million albums worldwide.\\n\\nSnoop\\'s debut album, Doggystyle, produced by Dr. Dre and released in 1993 by Death Row Records, debuted at number one on both the Billboard 200 and Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. Selling almost a million copies in the first week of its release, Doggystyle became certified 4× platinum in 1994 and spawned several hit singles, including \"What\\'s My Name?\" and \"Gin & Juice\". In 1994 Snoop released a soundtrack on Death Row Records for the short film Murder Was the Case, starring himself. His second album, Tha Doggfather (1996), also debuted at number one on both charts, with \"Snoop\\'s Upside Ya Head\" as the lead single. The album was certified double platinum in 1997.\\n\\nAfter leaving Death Row Records, Snoop signed with No Limit Records, where he recorded his next three albums, Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told (1998), No Limit Top Dogg (1999), and Tha Last Meal (2000). Snoop then signed with Priority/Capitol/EMI Records in 2002, where he released Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss. He then signed with Geffen Records in 2004 for his next three albums, R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece, Tha Blue Carpet Treatment, and Ego Trippin\\'. Malice \\'n Wonderland (2009), and Doggumentary (2011) were released on Priority. Snoop Dogg has starred in motion pictures and hosted several television shows, including Doggy Fizzle Televizzle, Snoop Dogg\\'s Father Hood, and Dogg After Dark. He also coaches a youth football league and a high school football team. In September 2009 Snoop was hired by EMI as the chairman of reactivated Priority Records.\\n\\nIn 2012, after a trip to Jamaica, Snoop announced a conversion to Rastafarianism and a new alias, Snoop Lion.

His 13th studio album, Bush, was released in May 2015 and marked a return of the Snoop Dogg name. His 14th solo studio album, Coolaid, was released in July 2016. Snoop has 17 Grammy nominations without a win.\\n\\nIn 2018, he released his first gospel album, Bible of Love.\\n\\nKool Moe Dee ranks Snoop at No. 33 in his book There\\'s a God on the Mic, and says he has \"an ultra-smooth, laidback delivery\" and \"flavor-filled melodic rhyming\". Peter Shapiro describes Snoop\\'s delivery as a \"molasses drawl\" and AllMusic notes his \"drawled, laconic rhyming\" style. Kool Moe Dee refers to Snoop\\'s use of vocabulary, saying he \"keeps it real simple...he simplifies it and he\\'s effective in his simplicity\".\\n\\nSnoop is known to freestyle some of his lyrics on the spot for some songs – in the book How to Rap, Lady of Rage says, \"Snoop Dogg, when I worked with him earlier in his career, that\\'s how created his stuff... he would freestyle, he wasn\\'t a writer then, he was a freestyler,\" and The D.O.C. states, \"Snoop\\'s [rap] was a one take willy, but his shit was all freestyle. He hadn\\'t written nothing down. He just came in and started busting. The song was \"Tha Shiznit\"—that was all freestyle. He started busting and when we got to the break, Dre cut the machine off, did the chorus and told Snoop to come back in. He did that throughout the record. That\\'s when Snoop was in the zone then.\"\\n\\nPeter Shapiro says that Snoop debuted on \"Deep Cover\" with a \"shockingly original flow – which sounded like a Slick Rick born in South Carolina instead of South London\" and adds that he \"showed where his style came from by covering Slick Rick\\'s \\'La Di Da Di\\'\". Referring to Snoop\\'s flow, Kool Moe Dee calls him \"one of the smoothest, funkiest flow-ers in the game\". How to Rap also notes that Snoop is known to use syncopation in his flow to give it a laidback quality, as well as \\'linking with rhythm\\' in his compound rhymes, using alliteration, and employing a \"sparse\" flow with good use of pauses.\\n\\nSnoop re-popularized the use of -izzle speak, particularly in the pop and hip-hop music industry.\\n\\nSnoop Dogg is a lifelong fan of professional wrestling. On March 30, 2008, Snoop Dogg appeared at WrestleMania XXIV as a Master of Ceremonies for a tag team match between Maria and Ashley Massaro as they took on Beth Phoenix and Melina.

       " 'Borrowing heavily from the impressionism of Debussy and Ravel, pianist Bill Evans brought an introverted, relaxed, and lyrical classical sensibility into jazz. Along with his keen technical ability and nuanced sense of harmony, Evans worked to democratize the role of the bassist and drummer in his succession of piano trios, encouraging greater contrapuntal interplay. After gaining widespread attention as a member of Miles Davis\\' late-\\'50s group, Evans garnered further acclaim for his own work, leading a celebrated trio with bassist Scott LaFaro and drummer Paul Motian and recording classic albums like 1960\\'s Portrait in Jazz, 1961\\'s At the Village Vanguard, and 1962\\'s Waltz for Debby, the latter of which borrowed its title from the pianist\\'s best-known composition. Following LaFaro\\'s tragic death in 1961, Evans eventually forged a lasting creative partnership with bassist Eddie Gomez and continued to perform, working with drummers Jack DeJohnette and Marty Morell. He earned accolades including Grammy Awards for 1968\\'s At the Montreux Jazz Festival, 1970\\'s Alone, 1971\\'s The Bill Evans Album, and 1979\\'s We Will Meet Again. With the passage of time, Evans has become an entire school unto himself for pianists and a singular mood for listeners, leaving his mark on such noted players as Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea, and Brad Mehldau.\\n\\nBorn and raised in New Jersey, Evans was recruited for Southeastern Louisiana University on a flute scholarship, where he received a thorough background in theory, played in the marching band, and also led his football team to a league championship as a quarterback. Graduating as a piano major in 1950, he started to tour with the Herbie Fields band, but the draft soon beckoned, and Evans was placed in the Fifth Army Band near Chicago. After three years in the service, he arrived in New York in 1954, playing in Tony Scott\\'s quartet and undertaking postgraduate studies at Mannes College, where he encountered composer George Russell and his modal jazz theories. By 1956, he had already recorded his first album as a leader for Riverside, New Jazz Conceptions, still enthralled by the bop style of Bud Powell but also unveiling what was to become his best-known composition, \"Waltz for Debby,\" which he wrote while still in the Army.\\n\\nIn spring 1958, Evans began an eight-month gig with the Miles Davis Sextet, where he exerted a powerful influence upon the willful yet ever-searching leader. Though Evans left the band that autumn, exhausted by pressured expectations and anxious to form his own group, he was deeply involved in the planning and execution of Davis\\' epochal Kind of Blue album in 1959, contributing ideas about mood, structure, and modal improvisation, and collaborating on several of the compositions. Although the original release gave composition credit of \"Blue in Green\" to Davis, Evans claimed he wrote it entirely, based on two chords suggested by Davis (nowadays, they receive co-credit).\\n\\nEvans returned to the scene as a leader in December 1958 with the album Everybody Digs Bill Evans, which included the famous \"Peace Piece,\" a haunting vamp for solo piano that sounds like a long-lost Satie Gymnopédie. Evans\\' first working trio turned out to be his most celebrated, combining forces with the astounding young bassist Scott LaFaro and drummer Paul Motian in three-way telepathic trialogues. With this group, Evans became a star -- and there was even talk about a recording with Davis involving the entire trio. Sadly, only ten days after a landmark live session at the Village Vanguard in June 1961, LaFaro was killed in an auto accident -- and the shattered Evans went into seclusion for almost a year. He re-emerged the following spring with Chuck Israels as his bassist, and he would go on to record duets with guitarist Jim Hall and a swinging quintet session, Interplay, with Hall and trumpeter Freddie Hubbard.\\n\\nUpon signing with Verve in 1962, Evans was encouraged by producer Creed Taylor to continue to record in more varied formats: with Gary McFarland\\'s big band, the full-orchestra arrangements of Claus Ogerman, co-star Stan Getz, and a reunion with Hall. The most remarkable of these experiments was Conversations with Myself, a session where Evans overdubbed second and third piano parts onto the first; this eventually led to two sequels in that fashion.\\n\\nBy 1966, Evans had paired with Puerto Rican bassist Eddie Gomez and formed a trio with drummer Jack DeJohnette. Though short-lived, the group garnered attention, picking up a Grammy Award for the 1968 concert album Bill Evans at the Montreux Jazz Festival. That same year, DeJohnette left to be replaced by Marty Morell. This version of Evans\\' trio continued to work for a decade, releasing albums like 1969\\'s What\\'s New and 1971\\'s Grammy-winning The Bill Evans Album. Evans also picked up a Grammy in 1970 for his solo piano date Alone.\\n\\nIn his only concession to the emerging jazz-rock scene, Evans dabbled with the Rhodes electric piano in the 1970s but eventually tired of it, even though inventor Harold Rhodes had tailored the instrument to Evans\\' specifications. He recorded further trio sessions with Gomez and drummer Eliot Zigmund before launching a final trio in the late \\'70s with bassist Marc Johnson and drummer Joe La Barbera. Often considered one of the pianist\\'s best configurations since the LaFaro-Motian team, their brief time together was documented on 1979\\'s Grammy-winning We Will Meet Again, also featuring trumpeter Tom Harrell and saxophonist Larry Schneider.\\n\\nBy the late \\'70s, Evans\\' health was rapidly deteriorating, aggravated by long periods of heroin and cocaine addiction. He died on September 15, 1980, at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. He was 51 years old. Along with a 1994 Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, a flood of unreleased recordings from commercial and private sources helped to further elevate interest in Evans\\' work. Turn Out the Stars: The Final Village Vanguard Recordings arrived in 1996, followed by 2000\\'s The Last Waltz, recorded at Keystone Korner in 1980. Resonance Records also released three archival albums featuring Evans\\' late-\\'60s trio: 2016\\'s Some Other Time: The Lost Session from the Black Forest, 2018\\'s Another Time: The Hilversum Concert, and 2020\\'s Live at Ronnie Scott\\'s. \\n\\nBiography by Richard S. Ginell\\n\\nThere are other artists with the same name:\\n\\n2.) Bill Evans (born 9th February 1958 in Clarendon Hills, Illinois, USA) is an American jazz saxophonist. His father was a classical piano prodigy and until junior high school Evans studied classical clarinet. Early in his studies he was able to hear such artists as Sonny Stitt and Stan Getz live at the Jazz Showcase in Chicago. He attended Hinsdale Central High School and studied with jazz tenor saxophonist Vince Micko.\\n\\nHe plays primarily tenor and soprano saxophones. Evans attended North Texas State University and William Paterson University, where he studied with Dave Liebman, who had played with Miles Davis. Moving to New York City in 1979 he spent countless hours in lofts playing jazz standards and perfecting his improvisational style. At the age of twenty-two he joined Miles Davis. In the early to mid-1980s, Evans played with Davis and was instrumental in his musical comeback. Notable albums recorded with Miles include The Man with the Horn, We Want Miles, and Decoy. \\n\\nIn addition to playing with Miles Davis he has played, toured and recorded with artists such as Herbie Hancock, John Mclaughlin (and his Mahavishnu Orchestra), Michael Franks, Willie Nelson, Mick Jagger, Les McCann, Mark Egan, Danny Gottlieb, Ian Anderson, and Randy Brecker, among others. He is featured on the Petite Blonde album with Victor Bailey, Dennis Chambers, Mitch Forman, and Chuck Loeb. \\n\\nTwo of his most recent albums Soul Insider and Soulgrass were nominated for Grammy awards. Soulgrass was a groundbreaking bluegrass-jazz fusion concept involving such musicians as Béla Fleck, Sam Bush, Bruce Hornsby, and Vinnie Colaiuta. Although his latest projects are musically eclectic, his stylistic roots remain in the history of jazz saxophone, influenced by such players as Sonny Rollins, Joe Henderson, Sonny Stitt, John Coltrane, Hank Mobley, Stan Getz, and Steve Grossman.\\n\\n\\n3.) San Francisco Bay Area musician and Virginia native Bill Evans has been involved with bluegrass music and the banjo for over twenty-five years as a player, teacher, writer, and historian. He occupies a unique niche in the banjo world: celebrated worldwide for his traditional and progressive bluegrass banjo styles as well as his innovative original compositions, he also enjoys a reputation as an outstanding instructor as well as being an expert player of nineteenth-century minstrel and classic/parlour banjo styles. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Evans\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'William \"Smokey\" Robinson, Jr. (born February 19, 1940) is an American R&B and soul singer and songwriter. Robinson is noted for being one of the primary figures associated with the Motown record label, second only to the company\\'s founder, Berry Gordy. As both a member of Motown group The Miracles and a solo artist, Robinson recorded seventy Top 40 hits for Motown between 1959 and 1990, and also served as the company\\'s Vice President from 1961 to 1988.\\n\\nEarly years and formation of the Miracles\\n\\nRobinson was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, and was nicknamed \"Smokey\" as a child, because of his love of westerns. The name originally came when an uncle (who would take a young Robinson to see westerns) gave him the name \"Smokey Joe\", Robinson began being called \"Smokey\" whilst in his teens. In 1955, Robinson founded a group he called \"The Five Chimes\" with his best friend Ronnie White, and Northern High School classmates Pete Moore, Clarence Dawson, and James Grice. By 1957, the group was called \"The Matadors\" and included cousins Bobby Rogers and Claudette Rogers in place of Dawson and Grice. With Robinson as lead singer, the Matadors began touring the local Detroit venues. In 1958, Robinson met songwriter Berry Gordy, Jr., who co-wrote for them the single \"Got a Job,\" an answer song to The Silhouettes\\' hit single \"Get A Job.\" The group renamed itself The Miracles, and issued singles on both End Records and Chess Records before Robinson suggested to Berry Gordy that he start a label of his own.\\n\\nIn 1959, Gordy founded Tamla Records, which he soon reincorporated as Motown. The Miracles were among the label\\'s first signees. Gordy and Robinson had a synergistic relationship, with Robinson providing a foundation for Motown\\'s hit-making success and Gordy acting as a mentor for the budding singer and songwriter. By 1961, Gordy had appointed Robinson vice-president of Motown Records, a title Robinson held for as long as Gordy remained with the company.\\n\\nMotown and The Miracles\\n\\nThe 1960 single \"Shop Around\" was Motown\\'s first #1 hit on the R&B singles chart, and the first big hit for The Miracles. They scored many more hits over the years, including \"You\\'ve Really Got a Hold on Me\" (1962), \"Mickey\\'s Monkey\" (1963), \"Ooo Baby Baby (1965), \"The Tracks of My Tears\" (1965), \"Going to a Go-Go\" (1965), \"More Love\" (1967), and \"I Second That Emotion\" (1967).\\n\\nBesides penning hits for his own group, Robinson also wrote and produced hits and album tracks for other Motown artists. Mary Wells had a big hit with the Robinson-penned \"My Guy\" (1964), and Robinson served as The Temptations primary songwriter and producer from 1963 to 1966, penning hits such as \"The Way You Do the Things You Do,\" \"My Girl,\" \"Since I Lost My Baby,\" and \"Get Ready.\" Among Robinson\\'s numerous other Motown compositions are \"Still Water (Love)\" by The Four Tops, \"Don\\'t Mess With Bill\" by The Marvelettes, \"When I\\'m Gone\" by Brenda Holloway, \"Ain\\'t That Peculiar\" and \"I\\'ll Be Doggone\" by Marvin Gaye, \"My Guy\" by Mary Wells and \"First I Look at the Purse\" by The Contours.\\n\\nFellow singer/songwriter Bob Dylan described Robinson as \"America\\'s greatest living poet.\" Robinson\\'s hit ballads also earned him the title \"America\\'s poet laureate of love.\" Over the course of his almost 50-year career in music, Robinson has over 4,000 songs to his credit.\\n\\nAfter marrying Claudette Rogers, Robinson started a family, and named both of his children after Motown: his son was named Berry after the company\\'s founder, and his daughter was named Tamla after the Motown imprint for which Robinson and The Miracles recorded.\\n\\nThe Miracles remained a premier Motown act through most of the 1960s. Albums were released as \"Smokey Robinson & the Miracles\" after 1965. By 1969, the group\\'s fortunes began to falter, and Robinson decided to quit The Miracles so that he could remain at home with his family and concentrate on his duties as vice president. The group stopped recording and Robinson prepared to leave the group. Unexpectedly, however, their 1966 recording of \"The Tears of a Clown\" was released as a single in 1970, and became a #1 hit in both the United States and the United Kingdom.\\n\\nDue to the surprise success of \"Tears of a Clown,\" Robinson was convinced to remain with The Miracles for a few more years. In 1972, he followed through on his original plans to leave the group, and The Miracles began a six-month farewell tour. On July 16, 1972, Smokey and Claudette Robinson gave their final performances as Miracles at the Carter Barron Amphitheater in Washington, DC, and Robinson introduced the group\\'s new lead singer, Billy Griffin. The Miracles went on for a while, even having another #1 hit, \"Love Machine,\" in 1976.\\n\\nSuccessful solo career\\n\\nSmokey Robinson began a low-key solo career while concentrating on his duties as vice-president of Motown, releasing his first solo LP, Smokey, in 1973. His first hit single, \"Sweet Harmony\" (1973), was dedicated to The Miracles.\\n\\nIn 1975, Robinson\\'s solo career went into full-drive after the success of the #1 R&B hit \"Baby That\\'s Backatcha.\" Robinson\\'s 1976 single \"Quiet Storm\" and its accompanying album typified a smooth, slow style of R&B that is today called \"quiet storm.\" Other Robinson solo hits include \"Cruisin\\'\" (1979), \"Being With You\" (a UK #1 hit) (1981), \"Tell Me Tomorrow\" (1982), and \"Ebony Eyes,\" a duet with labelmate Rick James (1983). He also recorded the soundtrack to the film Big Time (1977).\\n\\nSpokesmanship\\n\\nSmokey Robinson is the spokesman of the Great American Smokeout, which takes place annually one week before Thanksgiving. It\\'s a day when smokers quit smoking for at least a day. In 2006, It takes place on November 16th.\\n\\nLater years\\n\\nDuring the mid-1980s, Robinson fell victim to cocaine addiction. His recording slowed, and his marriage to Claudette faltered; the two were divorced in 1986. Robinson eventually overcame the addiction and revitalized his career, scoring hits in 1987 with \"Just To See Her\" and \"One Heartbeat.\" Also in 1987, British band ABC scored a US and UK hit with their tribute to Robinson, entitled \"When Smokey Sings\". In 1988, Robinson published his autobiography, Smokey, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\\n\\nUpon Motown\\'s sale to MCA in 1988, Robinson resigned from his position as vice-president. After one last album for Motown, Love, Smokey (1990), Robinson departed the company. He released one record for SBK Records, Double Good Everything (1991), the same year he won a Soul Train Music Award for Career Achievement. Eight years later, he returned to Motown, which by then was a subsidiary of Universal Music Group, and released Intimate (1999).\\n\\nSince then, Robinson has continued to periodically perform and tour. In 2003, Robinson served as a guest judge for American Idol during \"Billy Joel Week.\" He issued a gospel LP, Food for the Spirit in 2004. A new album of pop standards from the early 20th century, Timeless Love, was released in June 2006. It was originally recorded with a jazz combo, but strings were added after the fact, giving the album more of a lush sound but removing much of the jazz feeling of the disc.\\n\\nIn 2004, Robinson\\'s company, SFGL Foods, launched a special brand of gumbo called \"Smokey Robinson\\'s \\'The Soul is in the Bowl\\' Gumbo.\" [1].\\n\\nIn May 2006, at its 138th Commencement Convocation, Howard University conferred on Robinson the degree of Doctor of Music, honoris causa.\\n\\nSmokey Robinson is scheduled to appear on Duets on Fox along with Randy Travis, Patti Labelle, Chaka Khan, Dionne Warwick, Aaron Neville, Clint Black, Michael Bolton, Kenny Loggins, Brian McKnight, Macy Gray, Richard Marx, and Cyndi Lauper. David Foster will be a judge.\\n\\nOn 27th October 2006 Smokey appeared on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross.\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Smokey+Robinson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'b: 1948 in Toronto as William Amesbury. \\n\\nBorn in Toronto, Amesbury first emerged as a singer songwriter in several unsuccessful area bands before landing a deal with Columbia Records in 1968 as a member of The Five Shy. After two low-charting singles the band split. \\n\\nAmesbury quickly landed a solo deal in the early \\'70s on the Yorkville label where he had a hit a with novelty song called \"Frogman Bradley\". \\n\\nAs the first signing to Neil Bogart\\'s Casablanca Records in the US (and on Warner Music in Canada), Amesbury set about recording his debut album \\'Jus\\'a Taste Of The Kid\\' with Mel O\\'Brien (bass) and Wally Cameron (drums). The lead-off single was a moderate radio-friendly tune called \"I Won\\'t Let No One Get That Close To Me\" in 1974. Though this first single failed to hit pay dirt, the self-penned follow-up, \"Virginia (Touch Me Like You Do)\", scored a Top-10 hit in Canada and has gone on to be a classic AM staple on radio to this day. \\n\\nIn 1976 Amesbury moved on to Capitol Records for his sophomore release, \\'Can You Feel It\\', which was recorded at Phase One Studios and utilized a cast of seasoned studio players like Barry Keene, Doug Riley, Shawne Jackson, Colina Philips, and Wally Cameron among others. \\n\\nThe album\\'s title track spawned a minor Top-40 hit in Canada in 1977. His biggest success came through England with singles released on the Power Exchange Records label in the UK like \"Every Girl In The World, Tonight\", \"Saturday Night (I\\'ll Be Waiting)\" and \"I Remember\" throughout 1976-1977. \\n\\nBy the 1980\\'s Amesbury\\'s song began to get discovered by other artists including Natalie Cole (\"Nothin\\' But A Fool\"), and Mitch Ryder (\"A Thrill\\'s A Thrill\") among others. He soon quit the music business and is currently a social activist. \\n\\nIn November 1999 \"Virginia (Touch Me Like You Do)\" was awarded a SOCAN \"Classics\" designation for having reached 100,000 airplays on Canadian radio. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Amesbury\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'James William (Bill) Anderson III (born November 1, 1937 in Columbia, South Carolina) is an American country music singer and songwriter, who is also a two-time game show host, most notably for his role as the host of Fandango on TNN.\\n\\nOne of the most successful songwriters in country music history, Bill Anderson was also a hugely popular singer in his own right, earning the nickname \"Whispering Bill\" for his gentle, airy vocal style and occasional spoken narrations. \\nBiography & career\\n\\n[edit] Rise to fame\\nAlthough Bill was born in Columbia, South Carolina, he was raised in Atlanta, Georgia. He studied journalism at the University of Georgia, with an eye toward sports writing, and worked his way through school as a radio DJ, during which time he first tried his hand at songwriting and singing. [2] He attended the University of Georgia and earned a degree in journalism from the university\\'s Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication. Eventually, he landed a job at the Atlanta Constitution.\\n\\nHis composition \"City Lights,\" written when he was just 19 years old, while working in Commerce, Georgia at WJJC Radio 1270 AM, was recorded by Ray Price in 1958 and went all the way to the top of the country charts. Anderson took full advantage of his big break, moving to Nashville and landing a record contract of his own with Decca. [3]\\n\\n\\n[edit] 1959 – 1978: Career as a Country music singer\\nBefore signing to Decca, Anderson recorded for the small TNT label between 1957 and 1959, where he released three singles that failed to chart the Country charts at the time, including a version of \"City Lights\". After signing with Decca in 1959, he then left TNT.\\n\\nHis first chart hit came with 1959\\'s \"That\\'s What It\\'s Like to Be Lonesome,\" and he had his first Top Ten entry with 1960\\'s \"Tip of My Fingers.\" Early hits like \"Po\\' Folks\" (1961), \"Mama Sang a Song\" (his first number one, from 1962), and \"8 X 10\" (number two, 1963) still remain among his best-known. Anderson recorded his biggest hit and signature song, the partly spoken ballad \"Still,\" in 1963, and it not only topped the country charts, but crossed over to the pop Top Ten as well. [4] \"Still\" remains Anderson\\'s biggest hit. The song climbed to No. 8 on the Pop charts, as well as reaching No. 3 on the Adult Contemporary charts. The song made Anderson briefly a star in both Country and Pop music.\\n\\nAnderson remained quite successful throughout the 60s, scoring a number of No. 1s and Top 10s during that period of time.\\n\\nAnderson remained a regular visitor to the country Top Ten through the late \\'70s, and reached the Top Five a total of 19 times through 1978. Among the highlights were the number ones \"I Get the Fever\" (1966), \"For Loving You\" (a 1967 duet with regular partner Jan Howard), \"My Life (Throw It Away if I Want To)\" (1969), \"World of Make Believe\" (1974), and \"Sometimes\" (1976). By that point, Anderson was working often with a new duet partner, Mary Lou Turner. [5]\\n\\nHis final Top Ten country hit came with 1978\\'s disco-tinged \"I Can\\'t Wait Any Longer,\" and by 1982, Anderson\\'s inability to score a follow-up hit led him away from both songwriting and recording. [6]\\n\\nBesides his \"whisper\" of a singing voice, he was also known for his whispering recitations during songs, such as in \"Mama Sang A Song\" and \"Still.\" In songs such as \"Double S,\" he whispered through the whole single, telling about his fictitious one night stand with a woman who wouldn\\'t give her name, but mysteriously called herself \"Double S.\"\\n\\nBill has been voted and nominated Songwriter Of The Year six times, Male Vocalist Of The Year, half of the Duet Of The Year with both Jan Howard and Mary Lou Turner, has hosted and starred in the Country Music Television Series Of The Year, seen his band voted Band Of The Year, and in 1975 was voted membership in the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. Ten years later, the State of Georgia honored him by choosing him as only the 7th living performer inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. In 1993, he was made a member of the Georgia Broadcasters’ Hall of Fame. In 1994, South Carolina inducted him into their Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame. And in 2001, he received the ultimate honor, membership in Nashville’s prestigious Country Music Hall of Fame. [7]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Songwriting career\\nBill Anderson has written songs for many Country music singers, since first writing for Ray Price, among others in the late 1950s. Songwrting was the first career Anderson established before entering Country music as a singer. Anderson wrote many of Country singer, Connie Smith\\'s biggest hits in the 1960s, including her best-known song, \"Once a Day\", which topped off at No. 1 in 1964 and spent 8 weeks at the No. 1 spot, the longest by any female Country music singer. He was also wrote Smith\\'s \"Cincinnati, Ohio\" in 1967, among others.\\n\\nIn 1995, Billboard magazine named four Bill Anderson compositions – “City Lights,” “Once A Day,” “Still,” and “Mama Sang A Song” – among the Top 20 Country Songs of the past 35-years. No other songwriter had as many songs listed. [8]\\n\\nAnderson ended the 1990s with a pair of #1 hits, “Wish You Were Here,” by Mark Wills and the Grammy nominated “Two Teardrops” by Steve Wariner. His song, “Too Country,” recorded by Brad Paisley along with Anderson, Buck Owens and George Jones, won CMA Vocal Event Of The Year honors for 2001. The following year saw Kenny Chesney soar with his version of the Anderson-Dean Dillon masterpiece, “A Lot Of Things Different.” [9]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Acting and game show career\\nBill Anderson was the first country artist to host a network game show, starring on ABC-TV\\'s, The Better Sex. He also appeared for three years on ABC\\'s Daytime soap opera, One Life To Live. [10]\\n\\nFor six years he hosted an interview show called Opry Backstage, and found time to be co-producer of another TNN Show called, You Can Be A Star. In addition, Bill has appeared frequently as a guest star on television’s top variety and game shows, including The Tonight Show, The Today Show, Match Game, Family Feud, Password Plus (with substitute game show host, Bill Cullen), Hee Haw and others. He currently hosts Bill Anderson Visits With The Legends on XM satellite radio. [11]\\n\\nHe has also served as a television game show host, emceeing Fandango, which aired on The Nashville Network for seven consecutive seasons, in addition to co-hosting The Better Sex with Sarah Purcell. He also co-produced the The Nashville Network show, You Can Be a Star!, which was hosted by fellow country singer Jim Ed Brown. Anderson also occasionally appeared on the ABC soap opera One Life to Live. He was also a frequent guest on Match Game in the \\'70s.\\n\\n\\n[edit] 1990 – present: Career today\\nBill Anderson’s autobiography, “Whisperin’ Bill,” was published by Longstreet Press in 1989 and relates the fascinating details of his life and lengthy career in show business. The book, which Bill personally wrote over a period of three years, made bestseller lists all across the south. Bill’s second book, a humorous look at the music business titled, “I Hope You’re Living As High On The Hog As The Pig You Turned Out To Be,” was published in 1993 and is currently in it’s fourth printing. [12]\\n\\nHe has been a member of the Grand Ole Opry since 1961 and performs there regularly. In 2000, his latest album, A Lot Of Things Different, received rave reviews. Each song on the album was written, or co-written, by Anderson. His 1998 release, Fine Wine, was produced by Steve Wariner and released on Warner Brothers\\' Reprise/Nashville label. Bill Anderson\\'s Greatest Hits Volume I & II have been released on Varese-Sarabande Records along with The Best Of Bill Anderson on Curb. [13]\\n\\nOn February 15, 1965, Bill appeared--along with two “imposters”--on the game show, To Tell The Truth, challenging the panel to determine “the real Bill Anderson.” According to the affidavit read at the beginning of his segment, Bill was at the time “generally considered to be the top composer of country music in the nation.” Only two of the four panelists successfully identified Bill. At the end of the segment, he sang one of his own compositions, “Poor Folks.” (During questioning, Bill—the real Bill—got a big laugh when Kitty Carlisle asked, “Why are you wearing this costume?” After looking down at his brightly decorated suit--featuring sequined snowflakes--Bill deadpanned, “Well, it’s all I had.”)\\n\\nIn 2004 Brad Paisley and Alison Krauss scored a hit with Bill and Jon Randall\\'s, \"Whiskey Lullaby.\" In November 2002, BMI named Bill its first country songwriting Icon, placing him alongside R&B legends Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, and James Brown as the only recipients of that award. His compositions can be heard on recent or forthcoming releases by Vince Gill, Lorrie Morgan, John Michael Montgomery, Sara Evans, Tracy Byrd, and others. [14]\\n\\nJuly 15, 2006 marked Anderson\\'s 45th year as a member of the Grand Ole Opry. Anderson also hosts a show on XM radio entitled \"Bill Anderson visits with the Legends\" where he interviews various country music legends.\\n\\nThe video for the song \"Whiskey Lullaby\" won Anderson Video of the Year and Vocal Collaboration of the Year in 2004. \"Give It Away,\" co-written by Anderson and performed by George Strait, won the Academy of Country Music Song of the Year for 2006. In November 2007, \"Give It Away\" won the Country Music Association Song of the Year, an award that goes to the songwriters, Bill Anderson being a co-writer.\\n\\n\\n[edit] Discography\\n\\n[edit] Singles\\nYear Single Peak positions Album \\nU.S. Country U.S. Hot 100 \\n1958 \"That\\'s What It\\'s Like to Be Lonesome\" 12 -

       " '“He’s known the world over as the soulful singer/keyboardist of the iconic jazz-pop band Chicago.  His featured spots on the hits “Look Away” and “Hard Habit to Break” are among his mainstream highlights.  But Bill Champlin’s defining work with the Sons of Champlin and as a songwriter put him on the musical map long before he arrived in Chicago. Bill and the Sons were blowing the doors off venues back in the ’70s - and they returned to doing the same in the late ’90s and into the present.” \\n-- Greg Rule, Keyboard Magazine\\n\\nBill Champlin was born in Oakland, California on May 21, 1947 to a musical family.  His grandparents, mother and sisters have all been singers.  Bill is married to Tamara Champlin, a singer/songwriter in her own right, and is the father of three children.  His youngest, Will Champlin, is building a name for himself as a prolific songwriter with a distinct sound.\\n\\nChamplin’s musical career began in 1961 when he formed a band called the Opposite Six.  A year later he began writing music.  After forming the Sons of Champlin in 1967 he focused his songwriting talents on producing material for the Sons.  “They were breathing fire.  They were the most talented of all the San Francisco bands”, said Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead.  The Sons’ first album, “Loosen Up Naturally”, was released in 1969, followed by six more albums before they broke up in 1977.  Many of these have been re-released as CD’s and are currently available for purchase. \\n\\nAfter the breakup of the Sons, Bill moved to Los Angeles and worked as a session lead and background vocalist on numerous recordings from 1977-1985.  Some of the artists that he has worked with include Patti LaBelle, Lou Rawls, Elton John, Boz Scaggs, Donna Summer, Nancy Wilson, George Benson, Jimmy Smith, Amy Grant, Neil Diamond and Kenny Rogers.  In 1978 he released “Single”, his first solo album.  In 1979 he won his first Grammy award for co-writing “After the Love is Gone”, which was later recorded by Earth, Wind & Fire. During the recent Chicago/EWF tours in 2004 and 2005, Champlin was asked to perform this song with them, as lead singer. \\n\\nThe National Association of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) awarded Bill the Most Valuable Player peer award for male background vocalists in 1980.  In 1981 he won another Grammy for co-writing Turn Your Love Around for George Benson, and released his second solo album that year, “Runaway”.  In 1982 he joined Chicago to record Chicago 16.  “Bill’s exactly what we’ve been looking for,” said Chicago’s Robert Lamm.  His very distinctive and expressive vocals can be heard on Chicago\\'s hit, \"Hard Habit to Break\".\\n\\nIn 1988 Bill’s recording of the song, “In the Heat of the Night”, was picked up as a show opener by the television show of the same name.  The following year Chicago released the song of the year, “Look Away”, featuring Champlin on lead vocals.  In 1990 Bill released the critically acclaimed “No Wasted Moments”.  That same year he was asked to perform two songs from “No Wasted Moments” at the Tokyo Music Festival, and was presented with their songwriter of the year award.\\n\\nNext came four solo albums, “Burn Down The Night” (1992), “Through It All” (1994), “He Started To Sing” (1995) and “Mayday” (1996).  In July, 1997, “Here in my Heart” topped the adult contemporary charts for Chicago, featuring Champlin on lead vocals.  1997 also saw an a capella release of “West Coast All Stars”, a project he did with Jason Scheff of Chicago, and Toto’s Bobby Kimball and Joseph Williams.\\nThe Sons of Champlin reunited in 1997, with a loyal group of enthusiastic fans traveling great distances to see them perform.  They recorded “Live At The Luther Burbank Center” in 1998, as well as “Secret” (CD and DVD) and “Hip Lil\\' Dreams’ in 2002.  \\n\\nBill’s newest release is the solo CD / DVD “No Place Left To Fall”.  It was recorded at the Barber Shop Studios in Hopatcong, New Jersey for the DreamMakers Music label.  It was first released by JVC Japan on September 24, 2008, as well as being release for digital downloading, and later released in Europe by Zink Music on December 10, 2008.  The U.S. release by DreamMakers was on August 4, 2009.\\n\\nWith “No Place Left to Fall”, Bill Champlin has made the album he was born to make, a career-defining record with an honesty and immediacy that reflect his old-school approach to music – and his complete disregard for the old-model music industry.\\n\\n“It’s not completely auto-tuned and processed like a lot of CDs are lately,” says Champlin.  “It may not be dead-on perfect, but I think the dead-on perfect records are just that - dead.”\\n\\n“No Place Left to Fall” captures the many sides of Champlin, thanks to Mark Eddinger and Dennis D’Amico at indie label DreamMakers Music who helped him sort through four CDs worth of material to find the 13 gems that best exemplified the range of his artistry.  Rather than insist Champlin deliver a particular kind of album that would fit neatly within a genre bin of the now nearly extinct species we knew as record stores, they encouraged him to do it all – ballsy blues numbers, jazz, straight ahead rock ‘n’ roll, funk, R&B and achingly beautiful pop songs that don’t give a damn if they exceed three minutes.  “I felt Bill deserved to make a record without having a set of rules,” says Eddinger.\\n\\n“I went, ‘Wow, you mean somebody wants me to be myself? Dig that!’” says Champlin, who has time and again had to tell major label executives that no, he wasn’t interested in making an album that sounds like the latest flavor of the month.  (Go to Champlin’s MySpace page and you’ll see only one artist listed after the obligatory “sounds like” section: Bill Champlin.)\\n\\n“A lot of times somebody from a band puts out a solo album and you realize it’s just an extension of that  band,” says Champlin, who hit the road in November in support of his new album.  “That ain’t what this is.  This album is an extension of what I do and where I’ve been coming from. Just wait ‘til you hear the live versions of these songs!”\\n\\nBill has also left Chicago.  According to his official his press release, after 28 years with Chicago, singer-songwriter-keyboardist Bill Champlin is parting ways with the classic jazz/rock band to focus once again on his solo career.  The announcement comes on the heels of the August 4th release of “No Place Left to Fall”.  “This music is callin’ me,” said Champlin.\\n\\nThe two-time GRAMMY® award winner then launched a successful West Coast tour beginning in November of 2009, with the Bill Champlin Band promoting \"No Place Left To Fall\", followed by a Sons of Champlin tour in March, 2010.  He was also invited to Norway last year by the Norwegian Kringkastings Orchestra to perform with his wife, Tamara Champlin, in Oslo.   April 28th-30th,  2011,  the Bill Champlin Band was live at the Cotton Club In Japan. The Band, since renamed \"Champlin\", also features Will Champlin, Tamara Champlin, Carmen Grillo, Bobby Watson and Herman Matthews. This current lineup is now performing in Kuwait and Iraq as part of Bobby Kimball\\'s USO Tour. They will return to the States to play a showcase engagement at the Canyon Club July 7, 2011. \\n\\nIn the words of drummer, Billy Ward, “I became a Bill Champlin fan in the early seventies when he led, what was to me, a ground-breaking band, The Sons Of Champlin.  He\\'s written and sang on probably over 400 hit songs, the later ones with the band Chicago.  His organ playing has him ranked on most peoples \"A\" list and he plays the heck out of the guitar as well!  He is one of the finest musicians I\\'ve ever gotten the privilege to play with.”  Dennis Cook, in Jambase and Relix Magazine adds, “Age has done nothing to diminish his powers, and in fact, brings nuances to the material that a young cat just can\\'t muster.”\\n\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Champlin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He also received nominations in the Best Original Song category for \"Gonna Fly Now\" from Rocky and for the title song of For Your Eyes Only. He was the musical director at the Academy Awards a record nineteen times.\\n\\nConti, an Italian American, was born in Providence, Rhode Island, United States, the son of Lucetta and William Conti. He graduated from North Miami High School in 1959. He is a past winner of the Silver Knight Award presented by the Miami Herald. He is a graduate of Louisiana State University, and also studied and gained honors at the Juilliard School of Music, including a master\\'s degree.\\n\\nAs early as 1971, Bill was orchestrating pop recordings by Italian artists, such as the album \"Si .. incoerenza\" (yes to incoherence) by Italian singer Patty Pravo. He was also a ghostwriter of the scores for Spaghetti Westerns. Conti\\'s big break into celebrity came in 1976, when United Artists hired him to compose the music for a small film called Rocky. The film became a phenomenon and won three Oscars at the 49th Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The same ceremony was also the first time Conti served as musical director for the telecast, a role he reprised 19 times, more than any other person. His training montage tune, \"Gonna Fly Now\", topped the Billboard singles chart in 1977, and earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song.\\n\\nConti also composed music for the sequels Rocky II (1979), Rocky III (1982), Rocky V (1990) and Rocky Balboa (2006).\\n\\nConti also worked for some other films and, eventually, for television series.

By the time he was 15, he had joined a Philadelphia area combo, playing local theaters and clubs while attending high school.\\n\\nHe later sold his band to Lucky Millinder, and worked during the 1930s and early 1940s for both Millinder and arranger Jimmy Mundy. In 1942 he was hired as The Ink Spots\\' pianist and arranger.\\n\\nIn 1949, he replaced Wild Bill Davis in Louis Jordan\\'s Tympany Five. It was there that he first achieved success playing the Hammond organ and he is also reputed to have written one of Jordan\\'s biggest hits, \"Saturday Night Fish Fry\", for which Jordan claimed the writing credit.\\n\\nIn 1951, he organized his own trio and began recording for King Records. His best known recording is \"Honky Tonk,\" a rhythm and blues hit of 1956 which sold four million copies, and which he co-wrote with Billy Butler. He won the Cash Box award for best rhythm and blues performer in 1957, 1958, and 1959. He also arranged for many bandleaders and performers, including Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, and Lionel Hampton. He continued to play and arrange until he died of a heart attack in New York City.\\n\\nAs a jazz player Doggett started in swing music and later played soul jazz, a field in which rhythm and blues organists were highly sought after. His band included saxophonists Red Holloway, Clifford Scott, Percy France, David \"Bubba\" Brooks, Floyd \"Candy\" Johnson, guitarists Floyd Smith, Pete Mays, and singers Toni Williams and Betty Saint-Clair.\\nWith his instrumental hit \"Honky Tonk\" in February 1956, Bill Doggett (born William Ballard Doggett) created one of rock\\'s greatest instrumental tracks. Although it generated scores of offers to perform in rock & roll clubs throughout the United States, Doggett remained tied to the jazz and organ-based R&B that he had performed since the 1930s. Continuing to record for the Cincinnati-based King label until 1960, he went on to record for Warner Brothers, Columbia, ABC-Paramount and Sue. His last session came as a member and producer of an all-star jazz/R&B group, Bluesiana Hurricane in 1995.\\n\\nWith his instrumental hit “Honky Tonk” in February 1956, Bill Doggett (born William Ballard Doggett) created one of rock’s greatest instrumental tracks.

Persuaded by his mother (a church pianist), to try keyboards instead, he quickly mastered the instrument. Hailed as a child prodigy by his 13th birthday, he formed his first band, the Five Majors, at the age of 15.\\n\\nPerforming with the Jimmy Gorman Band, the pit orchestra at the Nixon Grand Theater, while still in high school, Doggett assumed leadership of the group in 1938. The experience was brief, however, as Doggett sold the orchestra to Lucky Millinder, with whom he continued to work off and on for the next four years. He made his recording debut on Millinder\\'s tracks, \"Little Old Lady From Baltimore\" and \"All Aboard\" in 1939.\\n\\nAlthough he formed a short-lived orchestra with Benny Goodman\\'s arranger, Jimmy Mundy, in late 1939, Doggett continued to work primarily as a sideman.

       " 'William Harrison \"Bill\" Withers Jr. (July 4, 1938 – March 30, 2020) was an American singer-songwriter and musician. He had several hits over a relatively short career of fifteen years, including \"Ain\\'t No Sunshine\" (1971), \"Grandma\\'s Hands\" (1971), \"Use Me\" (1972), \"Lean on Me\" (1972), \"Lovely Day\" (1977), and \"Just the Two of Us\" (1981). Withers won three Grammy Awards and was nominated for six more. His life was the subject of the 2009 documentary film Still Bill. Withers was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005 and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015. Two of his songs were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\\n\\nWithers, the youngest of six children, was born in the small coal-mining town of Slab Fork, West Virginia, on July 4, 1938. He was the son of Mattie (Galloway), a maid, and William Withers, a miner. He was born with a stutter and later said he had a hard time fitting in. His parents divorced when he was three, and he was raised by his mother\\'s family in nearby Beckley, West Virginia. He was 13 years old when his father died. Withers enlisted in the United States Navy at the age of 17, and served for nine years, during which time he became interested in singing and writing songs.\\n\\nHe left the Navy in 1965, relocating to Los Angeles in 1967 to start a music career. His debut release was \"Three Nights and a Morning\" in 1967. Arranged by Mort Garson, the song went unnoticed at the time but was later reworked by Withers as the track \"Harlem\".\\n\\nWithers worked as an assembler for several different companies, including Douglas Aircraft Corporation, IBM and Ford, while recording demo tapes with his own money, shopping them around and performing in clubs at night. When he returned with the song \"Ain\\'t No Sunshine\" in 1971, he refused to resign from his job because he believed the music business was a fickle industry. In early 1970, Withers\\'s demonstration tape was auditioned favorably by Clarence Avant, owner of Sussex Records. Avant signed Withers to a record deal and assigned former Stax Records stalwart Booker T. Jones to produce Withers\\' first album. Four three-hour recording sessions were planned for the album, but funding caused the album to be recorded in three sessions with a six-month break between the second and final sessions. Just as I Am was released in 1971 with the tracks, \"Ain\\'t No Sunshine\" and \"Grandma\\'s Hands\" as singles. The album features Stephen Stills playing lead guitar. On the cover of the album, Withers is pictured at his job at Weber Aircraft in Burbank, California, holding his lunch box.\\n\\nWithers was known for his \"smooth\" baritone vocals and \"sumptuous\" soul arrangements. He wrote some of the most covered songs of the 1970s, including \"Lean on Me\" and \"Ain\\'t No Sunshine\". The former entered the Hot 100 chart through multiple versions, including Club Nouveau\\'s 1987 cover, which made the composition one of nine songs to have led the chart via different acts. With \"Lovely Day\", he set the record for the longest sustained note on a chart hit on American charts, holding a high E for 18 seconds. Editors from The Guardian considered that Withers\\' songs are \"some of the most beloved in the American songbook,\" citing, \"\\'Ain\\'t No Sunshine\\' is regarded as one of the all-time great breakup tracks, while \\'Lean on Me\\', an ode to the supportive power of friendship ...\" For the same newspaper, Alex Petridis noticed \"[he] laid pain and paranoia under his deceptively gentle songs, and retired early having conquered gospel, funk, blues, disco and more.\" In Rolling Stone, writer Andy Greene noted that several of his songs \"are embedded in the culture and have been covered countless times.\"\\n\\nWriting for The New York Times, Giovanni Russonello considered Withers \"[a] soulful singer with a gift for writing understated classics\", adding, \"the ultimate homespun hitmaker, he had an innate sense of what might make a song memorable, and little interest in excess attitude or accoutrements. Ultimately Withers reminded us that it’s the everyday that is the most meaningful: work, family, love, loss.\" A Billboard article considered that Withers \"stands as one of R&B/soul music\\'s most revered singer-songwriters.\" In the same magazine, writer Gail Mitchell acknowledged \"Withers\\' legacy has flourished in the decades since, thanks to a cross-section of artists who have covered/sampled his songs or cited him as a major influence.\" Musician and music journalist Questlove referred to Withers\\' post-breakup 1974 album +\\'Justments as \"a diary [...] [it] was a pre-reality-show look at his life. Keep in mind this was years before Marvin Gaye did it with Here, My Dear.\" The Beach Boys\\' Brian Wilson deemed him \"a songwriter\\'s songwriter\". Musicians Sade, D\\'Angelo, Justin Timberlake, John Legend and Ed Sheeran have credited Withers as a music inspiration.\\n\\nWithers died from heart complications in Los Angeles on March 30, 2020, at age 81; his family announced his death four days later.

One of five children, Wyman spent most of his early life living in a terraced house in one of the roughest streets in Sydenham, southeast London. He describes his childhood as \"scarred by poverty\".\\nHe attended Beckenham and Penge Grammar School (Langley Park School For Boys) from 1947 to Easter 1953, leaving before the GCE exams after his father found him a job working for a bookmaker and insisted that he take it.\\n\\nWyman took piano lessons from age 10 to 13. A year after his marriage on 24 October 1959 to Diane Cory, an 18-year-old bank clerk, he bought a Burns electric guitar for £52 on hire-purchase, but was not satisfied by his progress. After hearing a bass guitar at a Barron Knights concert, he fell in love with the sound of it and decided this was his instrument. He created the first fretless electric bass by removing the frets from a cheap Japanese bass guitar he was reworking and played this in a south London band, the Cliftons, in 1961. He used the stage name Lee (later Bill) Wyman, taking the surname of a friend with whom he had done national service in the Royal Air Force from 1955 to 1957.\\n\\nWhen drummer Tony Chapman told him that a rhythm and blues band called the Rolling Stones needed a bass player, he auditioned and was hired on 7 December 1962 as a successor to Dick Taylor. The band was impressed by his instrument and amplifiers (one of which Wyman built himself), but because he was married, employed, and older, Wyman remained an outsider.\\nIn addition to playing bass, Wyman frequently provided backing vocals on early records and through 1967 in concert as well. He sang lead on the track \"In Another Land\", on the Their Satanic Majesties Request album and a single. The song is one of two Wyman compositions released by the Rolling Stones; the second is \"Downtown Suzie\" (sung by Mick Jagger), on Metamorphosis, a collection of Rolling Stones outtakes. The title \"Downtown Suzie\" was chosen by their erstwhile manager Allen Klein without consulting Wyman or the band. The original title was \"Sweet Lisle Lucy\", named after Lisle Street, a street in the red light district in Soho, London.\\nWyman kept a journal throughout his life, beginning when he was a child, and used it in writing his 1990 autobiography Stone Alone and his 2002 book Rolling with the Stones. In Stone Alone, Wyman claims to have composed the riff of \"Jumpin\\' Jack Flash\" with Brian Jones and drummer Charlie Watts. Wyman mentions that \"(I Can\\'t Get No) Satisfaction\" was released as a single only after a 3-2 vote within the band: Wyman, Watts and Jones voted for, Jagger and Richards against, feeling it not sufficiently commercial. By the 1970s, Wyman, tired of the monopolisation of songwriting and production by Jagger and Richards,[citation needed] began solo projects. In the 1970s and early 1980s he made three solo albums, none commercially very successful but all well received by critics. In July 1981 his \"(Si, Si) Je suis un rock star\" became a top-20 hit in many countries.\\n\\nWyman also played on The London Howlin\\' Wolf Sessions, released 1971, with Howlin\\' Wolf, Eric Clapton, Charlie Watts and Stevie Winwood, and on the album Jamming with Edward, released in 1972, with Ry Cooder, Nicky Hopkins, Jagger and Watts.\\nWyman composed the score of the 1981 Ryan O\\'Neal-Omar Sharif film Green Ice; and in the mid-1980s, he composed music for two films by Italian director Dario Argento: Phenomena (1985) and Terror at the Opera (1987).\\nIn 1985, he was approached by producers working on a movie based on the Vietnam War, who asked him to provide the theme tune. He completed a demo cover version of the 1969 song Spirit in the Sky and sent it off to them for review. The producers\\' feedback was highly positive, but they soon ran out of money and had to scrap the project. The demo tape was apparently lost, but on an audio CD included with Bill Wyman\\'s Scrapbook in 2013, he says that \"somebody out there must have heard it because four months later - in the June of that year - Doctor and the Medics appeared with the release of their version of that song which eventually went to number one for three weeks. A coincidence perhaps? Still, such is life.\"\\nHe made a cameo appearance in the 1987 film Eat the Rich. He produced and managed the group Tucky Buzzard.\\nWyman was close to Brian Jones; he and Jones usually shared rooms together while they were on tour and often went to clubs together. He and Jones hung out together even when Jones was distancing himself from the band. Wyman was distraught when he heard the news of Jones\\' death. He and Watts were the only Rolling Stones members at Jones\\' funeral in July 1969. Wyman was also friends with guitarist Mick Taylor. Like the other Rolling Stones, he has worked with Taylor since Taylor\\'s departure from the band in 1974.\\nAfter the Rolling Stones\\' 1989-90 Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle tours, Wyman left the group; his decision was announced in January 1994. The Rolling Stones have continued to record and tour with Darryl Jones on bass.\\nOn 24 October 2012, the Stones announced that Wyman and Mick Taylor were expected to join them on stage at the upcoming shows in London (25 and 29 November) and Newark (13 and 15 December). Richards went on to say that the pair would strictly be guests, and Darryl Jones would continue to supply the bass for the majority of the show. He said, \"Darryl doesn\\'t get enough recognition. He and Bill can talk about songs they want to step in and out of.\" At the first London show on 25 November, Wyman played on two back-to-back tracks: \"It\\'s Only Rock \\'n Roll (But I Like It)\" and \"Honky Tonk Women\". He later stated that he was not interested in joining the band for further tour dates in 2013.\\n\\nWyman continues to tour with the Rhythm Kings, which has featured such musicians as Martin Taylor, Albert Lee, Gary Brooker, Terry Taylor (formerly with Tucky Buzzard), Mike Sanchez and Georgie Fame. Following his 70th birthday in October 2006, Wyman undertook another British tour.\\nOn 10 December 2007, Wyman and his band appeared alongside a reunited Led Zeppelin at the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at the O2 in London.\\nWyman was a judge for the 5th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists\\' careers.\\nIn 2009, ex-Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor was invited as a guest performer with Wyman\\'s Rhythm Kings.\\nOn 25 October 2009, Wyman performed a reunion show with Faces, filling in for the late Ronnie Lane as he had previously done in 1986 and 1993.\\nOn 19 April 2011, pianist Ben Waters released an Ian Stewart tribute album titled Boogie 4 Stu. Wyman played on two tracks: \"Rooming House Boogie\" and \"Watchin\\' the River Flow\", the latter recorded with the Rolling Stones.\\n\\n\\nWyman, on bass during the Rolling Stones\\' tour in 1975. Holding his bass guitar vertically in the position as an Upright bass has been his trademark.\\nWyman\\'s bass sound came not only from his home-made fretless bass, but the \"walking bass\" style he adopted, inspired by Willie Dixon and Ricky Fenson.[citation needed] Wyman has played a number of basses, including a Framus Star bass and a number of other Framus basses, a Vox Teardrop bass (issued as a Bill Wyman signature model), a Fender Mustang Bass, two Ampeg Dan Armstrong basses, a Gibson EB-3, and a Travis Bean bass. The bass he has been playing mostly since the late 80s is a Steinberger bass. Wyman\\'s amplifiers over the years have included a Vox T-60, a piggyback Fender Bassman, a Hiwatt bass stack, and an Ampeg SVT. Wyman, especially in the early Stones\\' years, had a distinctive way of holding his bass – almost vertically. He stated that the reason he held a bass in that position was simply because his hands were small.\\n\\nWyman, although moderate in his use of alcohol and drugs, has stated that he became \"girl mad\" as a psychological crutch. Maxim magazine ranked Wyman at number 10 on its \"Living Sex Legends\" list, as he is reputed to have had sex with over 1,000 women.\\nWyman married his first wife Diane in 1959 and their son Stephen Paul Wyman was born on 29 March 1962. They separated in 1967 and divorced in 1969.\\nFrom 1967 to 1983 Wyman was romantically linked to Astrid Lundström.\\nOn 2 June 1989, aged 52, Wyman married 18-year-old Mandy Smith whom he had been dating since she was 13 and he was 47 years old. According to Smith, their relationship was sexually consummated when she was 14 years old. Their relationship was the subject of considerable media attention. The marriage ended in spring 1991, although the divorce was not finalised until 1993. In 1993, while Wyman was still married to Smith, Stephen, his son from his first marriage, became engaged to Smith\\'s mother.\\nIn April 1993 he married Suzanne Accosta. The couple have three daughters, Katherine Noelle (September 1994), Jessica Rose (November 1995) and Matilda Mae (April 1998).\\nWyman lives in a country house in Suffolk and in St. Paul de Vence in the South of France; in St. Paul de Vence his friends include numerous artists. He is a cricket supporter (as is Mick Jagger) and played in a celebrity match at the Oval against a former England XI taking a hat-trick.\\nWyman started selling metal detectors in 2007. Treasure detecting adventures in the British Isles are detailed in his 2005 illustrated book Treasure Islands co-written with Richard Havers.\\nWyman is a keen photographer. He has taken photographs throughout his career and in June 2010 launched a retrospective of his work in an exhibition in St. Paul de Vence. The exhibition included images of his music acquaintances as well as famous artists from the South of France including Marc Chagall.\\nWyman is also a supporter of British professional football team, Port Vale.\\nPolitically, Wyman has supported Britain\\'s Conservative Party.\\nIn 2009, he quit smoking after 55 years. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Wyman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Billie Myers (born 14 June 1971, Coventry, UK) is an English rock singer-songwriter. She is known principally for her 1998 transatlantic hit, \"Kiss the Rain\" (co-written with  Eric Bazilian and Desmond Child).\\n\\nPossessing both the introspective nature of Tracy Chapman and the unbridled spunk of Chrissie Hynde, Myers excels at weaving poetic narratives around starkly honest portraits of her life experiences “reassuringly long on singer-songwriting talent” (The London times).\\n\\nThe story of Myers’ discovery by record producer Peter Q. Harris (Will Smith) has become one of legend in the music industry. “I was dancing around being goofy, and Pete came up and said, “If you sing as good as you dance, we should work on some songs together.”  Myers’ giggles, “It’s kind of an embarrassing story.  Everybody thinks it happened at a strip joint or something, which of course it didn’t!”. Soon after, Myers entered the studio with world-famed record producer Desmond Child (Aerosmith, Ricky Martin, Cher, Robbie Williams). While working on some tracks in 1997, Doug Morris, president of Universal Music, dropped by to visit his pal Child.  After hearing Myers, he quickly offered the flabbergasted singer a recording deal. “I was simply lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time” says Myers.\\n\\nHer debut album “Growing, pains” spawned the infectious, hit single, “Kiss The Rain.” Carving out a spectacular niche on airwaves around the globe, “Kiss The Rain” stayed on Billboard’s Top 100 for over six months, reached the top ten internationally and the dance remix became a club-land classic. “Growing, pains” was certified gold in both the US and Canada.\\n\\nThe success of “Kiss The Rain” set off a lengthy period of worldwide touring. Driven by a need to entertain, not only perform, Myers astounded crowds with high energy, emotionally driven performances described as  “electrifying” by Rolling Stone Magazin and support slots on tours with Bob Dylan and Savage Garden.\\n\\nMyers made waves with performances at Lilith Fair, for which she handpicked by organzer and fellow musician, Sarah McLachlan.  Her videos for \"Tell Me\" and \"Kiss the Rain\" had frequent rotation on VH1 and The Box.\\n\\nAlong the way Myers appeared on numerous television shows including: “The Tonight Show,” “The Rosie O’Donnell Show,” “Good Morning America,” “VH-1’s Crossroads”, “The List”, and the “How To...” special.   It wasn’t long after, that requests for Myers’ vocals came pouring in eventually landing her on several TV soundtracks including: “Dawson’s Creek,” “Melrose Place,” “The Real World” as well as numerous European programs.\\n\\nÜber -songwriter/producer Diane Warren asked Myers to lend vocals to her latest gem. The song, “It All Comes Down to You” was featured on the soundtrack and in the movie of the same name.  Myers got a taste of Hollywood while shooting the video with the stars of the movie, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Julia Styles.  Myers clearly enjoyed her time during the shoot because it wasn’t long before she was acting herself and featured on “Wasteland” and “Purpose.”\\n\\n“Vertigo,” her highly anticipated sophomore release yielded across the board critical praise.  Vibe heralded the album stating, “… She has developed an ear for consistently potent, often provocative lyrics.  It’s apparent she’s weighed every word carefully and the lyrics fuel her performance… leaving you hungry for more.” Co-produced by David Tyson (Tina Arena, Amanda Marshall, and Alannah Myles), “Vertigo” tackled issues that were even more personal to Myers this time around such as racism, sexism and religious dogmatism. “Am I Here Yet,” reflected Myers’ uncertainty that sudden success brought to the singer.  Fans reacted strongly, as did legendary producer/DJ Junior Vasquez who remixed the single into a dance floor anthem and once again Myers found herself at the top the Billboard Dance Charts.\\n\\nAfter a four -year break, Myers returned with a pulsating and provocative new record, ”Just sex”. Exploring sexuality with her renowned, often-controversial directness, Billboard magazine declared “Its delicious verses gambol across a melodic carnival imprint topped only by a chorus so intuitive that one would swear this is a remake of a song heard a thousand times before.” Remixed by Eddie Baez, “Just Sex” became an instant #10 smash on the Billboard Dance Club Play chart which brought Myers back on stage, where as always, she both stunned and delighted audiences in venues across the U.S. and abroad. \\n\\nMyers\\' third studio album, “Tea & sympathy”, includes collaborations with such highly acclaimed songwriters as Peter Vale, (Lemar, Beverly Knight) Marcella Detroit, (Shakespeare’s Sister, Eric Clapton) and Kristen Hall, (Sugarland). While staying true to the expressive vocals and incisive lyrics that have earned her a loyal fan base and ongoing critical acclaim, Myers has broken new ground musically. Working with UK producer Dee Adam, Myers has fashioned a unique collage of sound that intertwines electronica, trip-hop beats, and bluesy guitars around her live acoustic/rock roots. “I have to confess,” says Myers “Dee pushed me creatively, to experiment beyond my usual comfort level, but hopefully the end result speaks for itself”\\n\\nWhile staying true to the expressive vocals and incisive lyrics that have earned her a loyal fan base and ongoing critical acclaim, Myers has broken new ground musically. Working with UK producer Dee Adam, she has fashioned a collage of sound that intertwines electronica, trip-hop beats, and bluesy guitars around her live acoustic/rock roots. \\n\\nHonest to the point of painful, Myers pulls no punches as she lays bare, bruising portrayals of her struggles with self worth (“Anonymous”), midnight losses of faith (“Send Me An Angel ...Is God Dead?”), infidelity (“You Send Me Flying”), and defeated Hollywood dreams (“Lady Jane”).  \\n\\nThe first single, “I Hope You’re Happy Now” is a cathartic ode to an ex- lover.  Hitting you where it hurts, lines such as “Another lover in my bed, wishing you were here instead” express the lonely frustration of an unwanted break- up. Luring the listener with its infectious hook and melancholy melody, its universal relatability ensures the listener feels that they are part of a highly intimate conversation. \\n\\nEver self- deprecating, Myers says “there’s even one moment of misguided optimistic romanticism (“Wonderful”) where I wonder what a lover, so seemingly perfect, sees in me but don’t be fooled - on “Not Another Love Song” (written about the same person), the answer becomes clear, NOT A LOT!”. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Myers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Billie Ray Martin describes herself as “a kid from Hamburg’s red-light district, who wanted to be a soul singer, but ended up playing repetitive machine music, while still trying to be a soul singer\".\\n\\nDubbed the \"queen of electronic soul\", Billie first came to prominence as a guest with S\\'Express before leading the acclaimed deep house act Electribe 101, her unique voice hitting both the house scene and charts with a strong infusion of soul.  Electribe 101 scored a brace of hits including the classic Talking With Myself and the album Electribal Memories, gaining rave reviews worldwide, before Billie departed to continue exploring fusions of electronic music, pop and soul. \\n\\nAfter releasing the thoroughly scary Persuasion with Spooky and the monumentally beautiful Four Ambient Tales with The Grid, Billie found herself with a worldwide number 1 in Your Loving Arms on East West Records; now considered one of the all-time classics of dance music. Four more top 30 hits and the album Deadline for My Memories followed. The album explored her vision to create music that draws equally on Kraftwerk and Phil Spector as influences, and allowed Billie to tour extensively.\\n\\nShe realised a dream by travelling to Memphis to work with Ann Peebles, Carla Thomas and members of Aretha Franklin\\'s band on her next album 18 Carat Garbage. Having attempted to capture the original Hi Records sound, Billie returned to Europe to add breaks and electronics to the final mix. She followed this with hit collaborations with DJ Hell and Slam and solo releases such as 2008\\'s Moroder-fest Undisco Me which hit the top spots in the UK and US dance charts.\\n\\nThe Crackdown Project, released in 2010, featuring Billie‘s takes on Cabaret Voltaire‘s landmark Crackdown album, reinforced her unique position as an artist who appeals to both the uber-cool mags like Flux and The Wire as well as the pop mainstream, achieving \\'Song of the Day\\' status at Popjustice. 20,000 downloads in a matter of days, plus overwhelming press and DJ support made this an unexpected success. \\n\\n2011 began with the solo single Sweet Suburban Disco, Billie’s take on Italo disco, followed by a collaboration with Hard Ton on the Sold Life E.P., taking her back to her house beginnings and Electribe 101 roots. \\n\\n2011 also saw the arrival of The Opiates – a project with Norwegian musician Robert Solheim. Their unique brand of electronic music combines a rare match of songwriting with cutting-edge beats and bleeps, the press dubbing them‚ The Carpenters of Techno’. The Rainy Days & Remixes E.P., served as a prelude to their eagerly awaited full-length album Hollywood Under The Knife, a celebrated gig at Rough Trade East causing much furore. Each song on the album is about another tortured diva, Hollywood actress, failed star... in search of identity, gender and a life beyond isolation.  Turner-prize winner Wolfgang Tillmans, who had twice photographed Billie and selected her as ‘most influential woman’ in i-D Magazine, supplied nine previously unseen images for the cover art and booklet. \\n\\nThe album met with support from DJs, press and blogs alike including a four star review in Metro and many ‘album of the year’ entries in major publications. Eight music videos and a UK tour, including a gig at HMV Oxford Street, played their part in gaining The Opiates a growing fan community. A deluxe double CD remix collection entitled Hollywood Cuts was released in March 2012, with one of the mixes being chosen to soundtrack HMV’s Summer TV campaign. \\n\\nSpring 2012 saw the release of a series of collaborations including Make Me Feel on Terranova’s Hotel Amour album, and Hyper Lust on Motor’s Man Made Machine – both earning support when released as singles across the Summer.\\n\\nThe limited edition DVD Five Takes (A Song About Andy), featuring five movies inspired by Andy Warhol‘s Screen Tests, was released in September. A song entitled On Borrowed Time is presented in five unique takes, with music by electronic producer and soul singer Waterson. This unique project was greeted with press and online acclaim.\\n\\nIn 2014, Billie released two singles which made a serious impression on dancefloors and club charts, gaining support from the world’s leading DJs. Her David Bowie approved cover of his song After All, followed by Off The Rails with Hercules and Love Affair’s Aerea Negrot continue to get played.\\n\\nBillie is currently working on her next solo album and a number of exciting to go collaborations.

       " 'Billy Joel (born William Martin Joel on May 9, 1949 in Bronx, New York, USA) is an American pianist, singer-songwriter, and composer. Since releasing his first hit song, \"Piano Man,\" in 1973, Joel has become a multi-million-selling recording artist. Joel recorded many popular hit songs and albums from 1971 until he stopped recording pop/rock music in 1993. He is one of the very few rock (or even pop) artists to have Top 10 hits in the \\'70s, \\'80s, and \\'90s. A six-time Grammy Award winner, he has sold in excess of 100 million records worldwide and is the sixth best selling artist in the United States, according to the RIAA. \\n\\nJoel\\'s induction into the Songwriter\\'s Hall of Fame (Class of 1992), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (Class of 1999), and the Long Island Music Hall of Fame (Class of 2006) has further solidified his status as one of America\\'s leading music icons. He has continued to tour occasionally (sometimes with Elton John) in addition to writing and recording classical music.\\n\\nJoel first lived in the South Bronx, in New York City, but his family soon moved to Hicksville, Long Island. Often he himself, along with many in the media, have confused this with him living in neighboring Levittown, NY (formed 1947). In truth, Joel lived on Meeting Lane in Hicksville, a town that has existed since 1648, near the Levittown border, in a section of town where Post-WW2, there were houses developed by Abe Levitt, known as Levitt Houses, thus forming nearby Levittown. His father, Howard Joel, was a Jewish Holocaust survivor from Germany, whose father Karl Amson Joel owned the fourth largest mail order company in Germany before being dispossessed by the Nazis. His mother, Rosalind Nyman, was born in England, to an agnostic Jewish family. His parents later divorced, and his father moved back to Eastern Europe. His half-brother Alexander Joel is an acclaimed classical pianist and conductor in Europe, now living in New York. \\n\\nFrom an early age Joel had an intense interest in music; especially classical music. He began piano lessons at an early age, and his interest in music instead of sports was the source for much teasing and bullying in his early years. As a teenager, Joel took up boxing so that he would be able to defend himself. He boxed successfully on the amateur Golden Gloves circuit for a short time, but abandoned the sport shortly after having his nose broken in a boxing match.\\n\\nJoel attended Hicksville High School, and was to have graduated in 1967. However, he was one English credit short of the graduation requirement; he overslept on the day of an important exam due to his late-night musician\\'s lifestyle.[citation needed] Faced with a summer in school to complete this requirement, he decided not to continue. He left high school without a diploma to begin a career in music. In 1992, the English credit requirement was waived by the Hicksville School Board and he received his diploma at Hicksville High\\'s graduation ceremony 25 years after he left the school.\\n\\nAt the age of 14 Joel joined his first band, The Echoes (which later became The Lost Souls). According to producer Shadow Morton, Joel was also the pianist on the Shangri-Las hit \"Remember (Walking In The Sand)\". In 1966, he joined The Hassles, a Long Island band that had some local success (\"Every Step I Take,\" \"You Got Me Hummin\\'\"). The Hassles released two albums The Hassles (1967) and Hour of the Wolf (1968) on the United Artists record label. Following The Hassles\\' demise in 1969, he formed the pop rock duo Attila with Hassles drummer Jon Small. Attila released their eponymous debut album in July 1970 and disbanded the following October.\\n\\nUpon losing his record contract with Attila, Joel suffered severe depression, and was admitted into Meadowbrook Hospital after ingesting furniture polish in a half-hearted suicide attempt. The note he left eventually became the lyrics to his song \"Tomorrow Is Today.\" Upon release from Meadowbrook Hospital in early 1971, he began to re-explore his place in the music business, including the participation in a television commercial with Chubby Checker and the contribution of rock criticism to a music magazine called Changes.\\n\\n*Cold Spring Harbor (1971)\\nJoel signed his first solo record contract with Artie Ripp of Family Productions, and subsequently recorded his first solo album. Cold Spring Harbor (a reference to the Long Island town of the same name), was released in 1971. However, the album was mastered at the wrong speed, and the album was initially released with this error, resulting in Joel sounding a half step too high (Joel later commented that he sounded like Alvin and the Chipmunks). The onerous terms of the Family Productions contract also guaranteed him very little money from the sales of his albums.\\n\\nIn order to get out of the deal with Family Productions, Joel moved to Los Angeles, California with Elizabeth Weber, and they married in Los Angeles in May, 1971. For six months of the following year, he played in the Executive Lounge piano bar under the name Bill Martin. This experience is what gave him the material for \"Piano Man.\"\\n\\nIn addition, a Philadelphia radio station, WMMR-FM, started playing a tape of a new song, \"Captain Jack,\" which was taken from a live concert broadcast which became an underground hit on the East Coast. An Executive from Columbia Records named Herb Gordon, heard his music and made his record label aware of Joel\\'s talent. From there he signed with Columbia Records. Hits such as \"She\\'s Got a Way\" and \"Everybody Loves You Now\" were originally released on this album, though they did not gain much attention until released as live performances in 1981 on Songs in the Attic. Since then they have become regular concert numbers. Cold Spring Harbor got a second chance on the charts in 1983, when Columbia reissued the album after slowing it down to the correct speed. The album reached # 158 in the US and # 95 in the UK nearly a year later.\\n\\n*Piano Man (1973)\\nHis experiences in Los Angeles connected him with record company executives, who bought out his contract with Ripp, with the condition that the \"Family Productions\" logo be displayed alongside the Columbia logo for the next five albums. Also in the contract was the agreement that Family Productions would receive a 25 cent royalty for every album Joel sold, which would come back to haunt him when he hit it big. His brief tenure in Los Angeles also inspired his signature song \"Piano Man.\" The album Piano Man was released in late 1973 and was certified Gold. To this day it has sold over four million copies. However, due to the large sums of money involved in the legal tangles of the contract buyout, Joel netted less than $7,000 in profit from his certified Gold record. Although this album is best known for its title track, several other future gems include \"Captain Jack,\" \"The Ballad of Billy the Kid,\" and \"You\\'re My Home\" (the b-side of the \"Piano Man\" single, which would later be covered by Helen Reddy), all of which would become staples of Joel\\'s live shows.\\n\\n*Streetlife Serenade (1974)\\nJoel remained in Los Angeles to write Streetlife Serenade, his second album under the Columbia label. References to both suburbia and the inner city pepper the album. The standout track on the album is \"The Entertainer,\" which picks up thematically where \"Piano Man\" left off. Joel was upset that \"Piano Man\" had been significantly edited down in order to make it more radio-friendly, and in \"The Entertainer,\" he refers to the edit with sarcastic lines such as, \"If you\\'re gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit, so they cut it down to 3:05.\" This refers to the album version of this song which is 5:37, and the edited single which is 3:05. Although Streetlife Serenade is considered one of Joel\\'s weaker albums (Joel has confirmed his distaste for the album), it still contains some notable tracks including the title track, with its Debussy-like intro, \"Los Angelenos,\" and the instrumental \"The Mexican Connection.\"\\n\\n*Turnstiles (1976)\\nDisenchanted with the LA music scene, Joel returned to New York in 1975. There he recorded what many fans and critics consider one of his best albums, Turnstiles. On Turnstiles, Joel used his own hand-picked musicians in the studio for the first time, and took a more hands-on role. Songs were initially recorded and produced by famed Chicago producer James William Guercio, who subsequently was fired. The songs were re-recorded and Joel took over, producing the album himself. Joel\\'s \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" was a minor hit, echoed the Phil Spector sound, and was even covered by Ronnie Spector. The album also featured the New York anthem, \"New York State of Mind,\" a bluesy, jazzy epic that has become one of Joel\\'s signature songs and was later covered by fellow Columbia labelmate Barbra Streisand on her Streisand Superman album. Other top songs on the album include \"Summer, Highland Falls,\" and \"Miami 2017 (Seen The Lights Go Out On Broadway).\" Songs such as \"Prelude/Angry Young Man\" would become a mainstay of his concerts for years.\\n\\n*The Stranger (1977)\\nFor his album The Stranger, Columbia Records united Joel with producer Phil Ramone. The album yielded four Top 40 hits on the Billboard Charts in the US. Album sales exceeded Columbia\\'s previous top album, Simon & Garfunkel\\'s Bridge Over Troubled Water, and was certified multi-platinum. It was Joel\\'s first Top Ten album, as it rose to # 2 on the charts. Phil Ramone eventually produced every Billy Joel studio release until 1989\\'s Storm Front. The Stranger netted Joel Grammy nominations, for Album of the Year and Song of the Year, for \"Just the Way You Are\", which was written as a gift to his wife Elizabeth and became his highest charting song to date in the United States.\\n\\nIn 2007 \"The Stranger\" was re-released with a bonus disk of a live concert recorded at Carnegie Hall June 3, 1977 that featured mostly songs from his first three albums. One can only guess that the success of \"The Stranger\" and \"52nd Street\" made this live album a bit obsolete for release at the time.\\n\\n*52nd Street (1978)\\nJoel faced high expectations on his next album. 52nd Street was conceived as a day in Manhattan, and was named after the block where Columbia Records\\' office was located. Fans purchased over seven million copies on the strength of the hits \"My Life\", \"Big Shot,\" and \"Honesty.\" This helped 52nd Street become Joel\\'s first # 1 album. \"My Life\" eventually became the theme song for a new US television sitcom, Bosom Buddies, which featured actor Tom Hanks in one of his earliest roles. 52nd Street was the first album to be released on Compact Disc in Japan (1982). The album won Grammys for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male & Album of the Year. Despite all the cover art for the album showing Joel holding a trumpet, he doesn\\'t play the instrument on the album. The trumpet is only played on one track, \"Zanzibar\", by trumpeter Freddie Hubbard.\\n\\n*Glass Houses (1980)\\nJoel in a promotional picture for Glass Houses.The success of his piano-driven ballads like \"Just the Way You Are\" and \"Honesty\" never sat well with him. With Glass Houses, Joel attacked the new wave popularity with aplomb. This album yielded such classics as \"You May Be Right\" (# 7, May 1980), \"Close To The Borderline\"(flipside of the \"You May Be Right\" single), \"Don\\'t Ask Me Why\" (# 19, September 1980), \"Sometimes A Fantasy\" (# 36, November 1980) and \"It\\'s Still Rock & Roll to Me,\" which became Joel\\'s first Billboard # 1 song in July, 1980. Glass Houses won the Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male. It would also win the American Music Award for Favorite Album, Pop/Rock category.\\n\\n*Songs In The Attic (1981)\\nHis next release, Songs In The Attic, was composed of live performances of less well-known songs from the beginning of his career. Songs In The Attic was recorded during arena and club shows in June and July of 1980. This release introduced many fans, who just discovered Joel when The Stranger became a smash in 1977, to many of his earlier compositions.\\n\\n*The Nylon Curtain (1982)\\nThe next wave of Joel\\'s career commenced with the recording of The Nylon Curtain. Considered his most audacious and ambitious album, Joel took more than a page or two from the Lennon-McCartney songwriting style on this heavily Beatles-influenced album.\\nWork began on The Nylon Curtain in the spring of 1982. However, Joel was sidelined when he was involved in a serious motorcycle accident. The driver ran a red light and collided with Joel, who was on his motorcycle. His left wrist was broken and his hand badly damaged. Due to surgery, which included the temporary insertion of five pins into his wrist, and a month in the hospital, production of the album was shut down temporarily while Joel recovered. In the meantime, Joel\\'s first video special, Live from Long Island, was recorded at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, on December 30, 1982. The Nylon Curtain went to # 7 on the charts, supported by the popular singles \"Allentown\", Goodnight Saigon, and Pressure. Allentown rose to # 17 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it one of the most-played radio songs of 1982 and the most successful song from The Nylon Curtain album. The album is considered by many of his fans to be the masterpiece of his works. Joel\\'s marriage began to suffer as his success rose, and Joel and wife Elizabeth divorced. In accordance with the divorce agreement, Elizabeth took half of the singer\\'s assets. Following his tour supporting The Nylon Curtain, Joel retreated to the island of St. Bart\\'s for rest and relaxation. At the hotel\\'s bar, he met supermodel Christie Brinkley, who had been divorced from her husband Jean-François Allaux. They eventually became a couple, and married on March 23, 1985.\\n\\n*An Innocent Man (1983) \\nJoel in a promotional picture for An Innocent Man.The song \"Uptown Girl\" was one of the first songs written when Joel returned from vacation. \"Uptown Girl\" was conceived as Joel wondered aloud how the gorgeous Christie Brinkley could wind up with a guy like him. It became a worldwide hit upon its release, and Joel\\'s sole # 1 in the United Kingdom. The resulting album, An Innocent Man, was compiled as a tribute to the doo-wop music of the 1950s, and also resulted in Joel\\'s second Billboard # 1 hit, \"Tell Her About It.\" The album, which reached # 4 on the charts, boasted 6 top-30 singles, the most of any album in Joel\\'s catalog. An Innocent Man was also nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy, but ultimately lost to Michael Jackson\\'s Thriller.\\n\\n*Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2 (1985)\\nFollowing the success of An Innocent Man, Joel had been approached to release an album of his most successful singles. This was not the first time this topic had come up, but Joel had initially considered \"Greatest Hits\" albums as marking the end of one\\'s career. This time, he agreed, and Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2 was released as a 4-sided album and 2-CD set, with the songs in sequence of when they were released. The new songs \"You\\'re Only Human (Second Wind)\" and \"The Night Is Still Young\" were recorded and released as singles to support the album. Greatest Hits was highly successful, selling over 20 million copies worldwide and becoming the top-selling double album of all time by a solo artist (and second overall after The Wall by Pink Floyd). It has since been certified diamond by the RIAA for 10.5 million albums sold (21 million disks). To date it is the 6th best selling album in American music history according to the RIAA.\\n\\nCoinciding with the Greatest Hits album release, Joel released a 2-volume Video Album that was a compilation of the promotional videos he had recorded from 1977 to the present time. Along with videos for the new singles off the Greatest Hits album, Joel also recorded a video for his first hit, \"Piano Man,\" for this project. Two versions of Greatest Hits were released on CD: the initial release on double CD in 1985, and a re-released Enhanced CD version in 1998. While both are the same basic album in general, there are a number of subtle differences between the two:\\n\\nWhile all the longer hits (\"Piano Man,\" \"Captain Jack,\" \"Goodnight Saigon\") are fully intact, many other shorter songs (\"Pressure,\" \"Just The Way You Are,\" \"My Life\") were shortened significantly in the 1985 release. Oddly enough, the included booklet lists all of the lyrics, even the parts cut for time. These songs are fully restored in the re-release. The 1985 release features the live version of \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" from Songs in the Attic. The version from Turnstiles was used for the 1998 re-release. \\nThe 1998 re-release features enhanced content due to advancements in CD technology over the previous 13 years. \\n\\n*The Bridge (1986)\\nJoel had already scored a hit with \"Modern Woman\" from the 1985 movie, \"Ruthless People,\" (starring Bette Midler, Danny DeVito, Helen Slater and Judge Reinhold), when he began work on the album that would become The Bridge in early 1986. Ray Charles contributed vocals and music to the song \"Baby Grand\" with Joel, and Steve Winwood played Hammond organ on the song \"Getting Closer.\" The final song recorded for the album was \"Code Of Silence.\" Cyndi Lauper appears on the album, contributing backing vocals. Though it broke into the Top Ten, The Bridge was not a success in relation to some of Joel\\'s other albums, but it yielded the hit \"A Matter Of Trust.\" In a departure from his \"piano man\" persona, Joel is shown in its video as playing a Les Paul-autographed Gibson guitar. The ballad \"This Is The Time\" also charted, and has been a favorite on the prom circuit ever since. \"Modern Woman\" was also released as a single and was quite successful, but Joel has since said in interviews he doesn\\'t care for the song, and subsequently it has been left off most of his compilation sets (the exception appears to be My Lives). It was also the last Billy Joel album to carry the \"Family Productions\" logo.\\n\\nAt around this time, Billy completed voice work on Disney\\'s Oliver & Company, released in 1988. A loose adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel Oliver Twist, Billy brought both his acting and musical talents to the film as Dodger. For the film, Billy recorded a song titled \"Why Should I Worry?\" Critics were generally positive towards the film, and pointed to Billy\\'s acting contribution as one of its highlights, despite it being his first acting job. In interviews, Billy explained that he took the job due to his love of Disney cartoons as a child.\\n\\nThroughout his tour supporting The Bridge, Joel and his handlers started planning a trip to the Soviet Union. He would be the first American rock act to play there since the Berlin Wall went up, a fact not lost on history buff Joel. There would be six live performances, three each at indoor arenas in Moscow and Leningrad. Joel and his family (including young daughter Alexa) and his full touring band made the trip in June 1987. The entourage was filmed for television and video to eventually offset the cost of the trip, and the concerts were simulcast on radio around the world.\\n\\nThe audience in at least the first Moscow shows was filled with members of the Communist Party, who received tickets from the government as a perk. Most of that audience took a long while to warm up to Joel\\'s energetic show, something that never had happened in other countries he had performed in. As a result of that a minor international incident occurred when he famously flipped over an electric keyboard during the second Moscow show as a show of frustration that his lighting engineers would not turn down the house lights to calm the audience despite several requests. The lighting engineers were more concerned with the amount of light being adequate for filming. \\n\\n*КОНЦЕРТ (1987)\\nThe album КОНЦЕРТ, Russian for \"Concert,\" was released in the fall of 1987. Singer Peter Hewlitt was brought in to hit the high notes on his most vocally challenging songs, like \"An Innocent Man.\" It has been estimated that Joel lost over US $1 million of his own money on the trip and concerts, but he has said the goodwill he was shown there was well worth it.\\n\\n* Storm Front (1989)\\nThe song \"We Didn\\'t Start the Fire,\" the first single from the album Storm Front, was released in September 1989. The song became Joel\\'s third US Number 1 hit. Storm Front was released in October, and it eventually became Joel\\'s first Number 1 album since Glass Houses, 9 years earlier. Storm Front was Joel\\'s first album since Turnstiles to be recorded without Phil Ramone as producer. For this album, he wanted a new sound, and worked with Mick Jones of Foreigner fame. Joel also brought in some fresh faces to join the band, including talented multi-instrumentalist Crystal Taliefero, who would go on to become Joel\\'s musical director and architect of his live sound. After \"We Didn\\'t Start The Fire,\" Storm Front also produced the hit \"I Go To Extremes.\" The album was also notable for its song \"Leningrad,\" written after Joel met a clown in the Soviet city during his tour in 1987, and \"The Downeaster Alexa,\" written to underscore the plight of fishermen on Long Island who are barely able to make ends meet. Another well-known single from the album was the ballad \"And So It Goes.\"\\n\\nIn 1992, Joel sued former manager and ex-brother-in-law Frank Weber (ex-wife Elizabeth\\'s brother) for $95 million after accounting irregularities were discovered. The case later settled out of court. \\n\\n*River of Dreams (1993)\\nJoel started work on River of Dreams in early 1993. Its cover art was a colorful painting by Christie Brinkley that was a series of scenes from each of the songs on the album. The eponymous first single was the last top 10 hit Joel has penned to date. The album includes hits such as \"The River of Dreams\", \"All About Soul\", \"The Great Wall of China\", and \"Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)\", written for his daughter, Alexa. A radio remix version of \"All About Soul\" can be found on \"The Essential Billy Joel\" (2001).\\n\\nIn August 1995, Billy Joel\\'s long-time bassist Doug Stegmeyer committed suicide in his Long Island home. Stegmeyer had played on every one of Joel\\'s albums from Turnstiles through The Bridge.\\n\\nIn 1999 Joel performed at New York\\'s Madison Square Garden on the eve of the new millennium which at the time was considered to be Joel\\'s last solo concert, The concert (dubbed The Night Of The 2000 Years) ran on close to 4 hours and was later released as 2000 Years: The Millennium Concert\\n\\nIn 2001 Joel released Fantasies & Delusions, a collection of classical piano pieces. All were written by Billy Joel and performed by Richard Joo. Joel often uses bits of these songs as interludes in live performances. The album topped the classical charts at # 1. On September 21, 2001, Joel performed \"New York State of Mind\" live as part of the America: A Tribute to Heroes benefit concert.\\n\\nJoel has toured extensively with Elton John on a series of \"Face to Face\" tours. During these shows, the two have played each other\\'s songs and performed duets.\\n\\nIn 2005, Columbia released a box set, My Lives, which is largely a compilation of demos, B-tracks, and live/alternate versions to hit songs. The compilation also includes the Umixit software, in which people can remix \"Zanzibar\", \"Only The Good Die Young\", \"Keepin\\' The Faith\", and live versions of \"I Go To Extremes\" and \"Movin\\' Out (Anthony\\'s Song)\" with their PC. Also, a DVD of a show from the River of Dreams tour is included.\\n\\nOn January 7, 2006, Joel began a tour across the United States. Having not written any new songs, he featured a sampling of all his songs in his career, including his major hits. His tour includes an unprecedented 12 sold-out concerts over several months at Madison Square Garden in New York City.\\n\\nOn June 13, 2006, Joel released \"12 Gardens: Live\", a double album containing 32 live recordings from a collection of 12 different shows at Madison Square Garden during his 2006 tour.\\n\\nThe singer\\'s stint of 12 shows at Madison Square Garden broke a previous record set by New Jersey native, Bruce Springsteen, when he played 10 sold-out shows at the same arena.\\n\\nThe record has consequently earned Joel the only retired number in the arena owned by a non-athlete. The retired number, which was 12, hangs in the rafters along with many others such as hockey great Mark Messier.\\n\\n2006 also saw Billy Joel visit the United Kingdom and Ireland (as part of the European leg of his 2006 tour) for the first time in many years, playing to capacity crowds in Birmingham, Sheffield, Southampton, Manchester, Glasgow, London and Dublin.\\n\\nOn July 31, 2006, Joel performed a free concert in Rome, Italy with the Colosseum as the backdrop, and performed classic hits for hundreds of thousands of fans. Joel performed favorites such as \"New York State of Mind,\" \"Honesty,\" and \"Just the Way You Are.\"\\n\\nWhile introducing one song, the 57-year-old singer joked in shaky Italian, \"This song is as old as the Colosseum.\"\\n\\nOrganizers estimated 500,000 people turned out for the show. The concert was opened by Canadian pop-rocker and songwriter Bryan Adams.\\n\\nBilly Joel will tour South Africa, Australia, Japan, and Hawaii in late 2006.\\n\\nJoel\\'s lyrics have made many references to locations in the New York City metropolitan area, particularly Long Island. For example, the \"Miracle Mile\" line in 1980\\'s \"It\\'s Still Rock & Roll to Me\" refers to the affluent shopping district located on Northern Boulevard in the community of Manhasset and 1980\\'s \"You May Be Right\" references walking through the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn alone as proof of craziness. In his 1973 song \"The Ballad of Billy the Kid,\" he describes a certain \"Billy\" as being from the town of Oyster Bay, the municipality in which the hamlet of Hicksville is located. He has since stated, in the liner notes from his album Songs in the Attic, that this \"Billy\" is not himself, but rather an Oyster Bay bartender.\\n\\nSeveral of Joel\\'s songs have grown out of specific personal experiences, including \"Piano Man,\" which he wrote describing his regular job playing at a Los Angeles piano bar in the early 1970s, and \"Scenes From An Italian Restaurant,\" purportedly written about either the Syosset mainstay Christiano\\'s or a similar eatery in New York City\\'s Little Italy. His song \"Vienna\" was supposedly written about a visit to his father in Europe, while \"Big Shot\" was based on a bad date with Mick Jagger\\'s ex-wife Bianca.\\n\\nIn a Playboy interview, Joel indicated that \"Rosalinda\\'s Eyes\" was penned for his mother, Rosalinda, as the song his father should have written for her.\\n\\n\"Only The Good Die Young\" created a bit of a stir within the religious community when it was first released in 1977. Some radio stations even refused to give the song any airtime. It is said that while Joel was doing a show in St. Louis, he had been specifically asked not to perform the song during the show and even received death threats; in response, Joel played it twice. Joel has said about the song that \"the point of the song wasn\\'t so much anti-Catholic as [it was] pro-lust\".\\n\\nHis music reflects influences from many different genres including European classical composers, Aaron Copland, 1950s doo wop, Broadway/Tin Pan Alley, jazz, blues, punk, ska, gospel, pop, and even Russian folk songs, to straight-up rock & roll. This has, in part, led to his broad success over a long period of time, but made him difficult to categorize in popular music today.\\n\\nIn the mid 1970s, the touring and studio lineup of Joel\\'s band stabilized. The main lineup consisted of:\\n\\nBilly Joel - lead vocals, piano, synthesizer, organ, harmonica \\nLiberty DeVitto — drums, percussion \\nDoug Stegmeyer — bass guitar, backing vocals \\nRussell Javors — rhythm guitars, backing vocals \\nDavid Brown — lead guitars \\nRichie Cannata — saxophones, flute, clarinet, organ, percussion, backing vocals \\nThis was also the lineup for Joel\\'s first live album, Songs In The Attic.\\n\\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw significant changes to Joel\\'s band. By the River of Dreams tour the only remaining long standing member of the band was DeVitto on drums. Multi-instrumentalists Crystal Taliefero and Mark Rivera joined and remain in his band to this day. Rivera had taken over the prominent saxophone solo in the song \"New York State of Mind\" that had previously been performed by Cannata (and was re-recorded by Rivera for the Greatest Hits version of the song). The 1993 River of Dreams tour saw the addition of Dave Rosenthal on keyboards who also remains with the band. Tommy Byrnes has become a frequent band member on guitar and was both a musical consultant and band member in the Movin\\' Out musical. For the 2006 tour, Joel did not invite DeVitto back as drummer. Chuck Burgi (from the Broadway production of Joel\\'s musical \\'Movin\\' Out\\') replaced DeVitto. Richie Cannata returns on saxophones, along with Mark Rivera and Crystal Taliefero, with Cannata again performing the \"New York State Of Mind\" solo.\\n\\n\\nDespite having never graduated from high school, Joel has been presented with multiple honorary doctorates:\\n\\nHonorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Syracuse University\\nDoctor of Humane Letters from Fairfield University (1991) \\nDoctor from Berklee College of Music (1993) \\nDoctor of Humane Letters from Hofstra University (1997) \\nDoctor of Music from Southampton College (2000) \\nDoctor of Fine Arts from Syracuse University (2006)[8] \\n\\nJoel was also named MusiCares Person of the Year for 2002, an award given each year at the same time as the Grammy Awards. At the dinner honoring Joel, various artists performed versions of his songs including Nelly Furtado, Stevie Wonder, Jon Bon Jovi, Diana Krall, Rob Thomas, and Natalie Cole. He was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame on Oct 15, 2006.\\n\\nIn 2004, Joel married 23 year-old Katie Lee. Lee is a graduate of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. At the time of the wedding, Joel was 54. Joel\\'s daughter, Alexa Ray, 18, served as maid of honor. Joel\\'s second wife, Christie Brinkley, attended the union and gave the couple her blessing. Lee works as a restaurant correspondent for the PBS show, George Hirsch: Living it Up!. In 2006, Katie Lee hosted Bravo\\'s Top Chef.\\n\\nIn 2002 he crashed his car in East Hampton, New York, and soon after entered Silver Hill Hospital, a substance abuse and psychiatric center in New Canaan, Connecticut. In 2003 Joel crashed his car into a tree in eastern Long Island, and was airlifted to Stony Brook University Hospital. In April 2004, Joel crashed his car into a house on Long Island. In March 2005 Joel checked into a Betty Ford rehabilitation center[12], where he spent 30 days. \\n\\nMovin\\' Out (2002), is a musical based on twenty-four Billy Joel songs which was a smash hit on Broadway from 2002 to 2005 (last Broadway show was on December 11, 2005). Joel was composer, lyricist, and orchestrator; Tony Award for Best Orchestrations. The musical is really a dance performance choreographed by famed choreographer Twyla Tharp, with Joel\\'s songs sung by Michael Cavanaugh. \\n\\nIn 2014, he started a series of concerts at New York City\\'s Madison Square Garden, and vowed to perform monthly as long as demand continued.  He sold out 73 consecutive shows through February 2020, before the record-setting series went on hiatus due to the pandemic.\\n\\nhttp://www.billyjoel.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Joel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His father, and his uncle Johnny Burnette, were two of the members of the 1950s band Johnny Burnette & The Rock \\'n\\' Roll Trio which also included Paul Burlison. It is said that Burnette performed on occasion with the Trio around the age of three. Johnny had a son born around the time Billy was born named Rocky who also became a musician. It has been said that the term \"rockabilly\" comes from the combination of the two cousins\\' names, Rocky and Billy, however that is an unconfirmed rumor. \\n\\nBurnette made his first recording when he was seven, appearing with Ricky Nelson on the 1960 song \"Hey Daddy (I\\'m Gonna Tell Santa On You)\".

       " 'Billy Joe Crawford is a Philippine-born musician and actor. He was born on May 16, 1982 in Manila, Philippines and was discovered at an early age, singing at a bowling alley. He would become a series regular on an afternoon television show called That\\'s Entertainment under the name of Billy Joe. He acted in a few movies, moved to the United States as a teenager, and started a music career, performing mostly in the United Kingdom and France, as well as in Asia. During this time he legally changed his name to Billy Crawford, giving him a more western surname. He previously dated Mandy Moore for about 3 months when he was 15 and she was 14. He currently resides in New York City.\\n\\nHe had major chart success in France and other parts of Continental Europe, but did not repeat this success in the United Kingdom or the United States, although his single \"You Didn\\'t Expect That\" did make the lower reaches of the UK Top 40, peaking at number 35. He also contributed a remix of the Pokémon anime theme for the first movie in the series.\\n\\nBilly\\'s latest album \"Big City\" was released in 2004 in France and Asia only. The single \"Bright Lights\" was unable to break into the any Top 10 charts. The second single \"Steamy Nights\", fared better making Top 40, and was featured on 7 compilations across Europe and was the first single in Germany. Another song from the album Candy Store was leaked from the album and received airplay on London radio. Thought to be a duet with Ginuwine, it is featured on the Big City album. After doing the first ever online reality show \"the MSN Dance Show\", his third single from Big City \"3 Wishes\" got cancelled by his label. Billy felt it was time for something new and decided not to re-sign his contract with V2 records.\\n\\nCrawford did not receive significant media attention after the Big City Tour 2005, mostly being mentioned in a few magazines for his break-up with Lorie, and new relationship with Maryss, a dancer he met when she auditioned for the Big City tour.\\n\\nIn 2006, Billy began recording a new album which was expected to be released in 2007.

       " 'Someone once said that, after silence, music comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible. Singer/songwriter Billy Falcon’s music has a way of doing just that. As an artist uses color, Falcon uses words and music to convey life’s beauty and fragility, the joy, and the heartache, the disappointment, and always, the hope.\\nOver his career, Falcon has released a dozen albums, each remaining true to his hallmark of beautifully crafted songs with lyrics that move the listener to laugh, cry, think, remember, and always, to hope. His latest record, “When,” features thirteen songs that each continue that legacy.  A poet, artist, and craftsman in the purest sense, Falcon somehow puts words and melody to all that it means to be human. The hauntingly beautiful title track, is a wistful yet joyful account of raising his daughter, Rose, alone.  Falcon’s strength and vulnerability, passion, and humor are woven throughout the album, from Sunday Comes, and Fall To Me, to the melancholy tale of Boggy Key, to the everyman’s Hundred Dollar Bill, you get the sense that you’ve felt it, you’ve lived it, and somehow Falcon has put it to words and music.   The record is a lyrical and musical testament that declares Billy Falcon’s music has maintained his authenticity, freshness, and significance.  Like the spirit of faith, hope, and love that is his muse, Falcon’s music endures.\\nStevie Nicks, Cher, Manfred Mann, Sherrie Austin, Meatloaf and Trace Adkins have covered Falcon’s songs, amongst others. Falcon has co-written over a dozen songs on the last six Bon Jovi albums, including Just Older, Last Man Standing, Everybody\\'s Broken, When We Were Beautiful and the new single, Superman Tonight, on their latest release, The Circle. Give In To Me, co-written with Falcon’s daughter, Rose is featured in Sony Pictures just released film, “Country Strong,” and is performed by Faith Hill on the film’s soundtrack.\\nFalcon, often referred to as “Long Island’s Own,” grew up in Rosedale Queens. He signed his first record contract with a major label at age 18. Falcon, a prolific writer, is a self-described reporter, chronicling his life experiences with poetic lyrics and stirring melodies. Heaven’s Highest Hill from 1991’s critically acclaimed “Pretty Blue World” album articulates the pain of having to tell his three-year old daughter that her mother had died. The rawness of the experience is captured in both the lyrics and Falcon’s performance, yet the overwhelming theme of the song is the endlessness of love and the beginnings of hope. The song, which relays Falcon’s tragedy of losing his 29 year old wife to breast cancer, is extraordinarily personal and yet resonates with anyone who has experienced loss. Power Windows, the single from the same album, and an anthem for those who have figured out what is really important and meaningful in life, was a Top 40 hit.\\nFalcon has lived in Nashville for the past 19 years.  Over the past four years, he has served as ringleader and inspiration to Nashville’s most talked about musical experiment, The Sowing Circle.\\n He continues to write, perform, record and produce records, his own, as well as for numerous promising young artists, his favorite of which is his daughter, Rose Falcon, a gifted singer/songwriter in her own right. She is currently signed to CAL IV and will be releasing a new album in early 2011.\\n\\n\\nMore Info & Music Available @\\nhttp://www.billyfalcon.com\\n\\nCashbox Magazine named Brick Off A Bridge\\nan ALL INDIE PICK.\\n\\nBilly has also been featured on:\\nQ104.3 Jonathan Clark’s Out Of The Box\\n102.3 WBAB Fingers’ Homegrown\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to listen to\\n the NEW RECORD,\" WHEN\"\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Falcon\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'William Frederick \"Billy\" Gibbons (born December 16, 1949) is an American musician, actor and car customizer, best known as the guitarist of the Texas blues-rock band ZZ Top. He is also the lead singer and composer for many of the band\\'s songs. Gibbons is known for playing his Gretsch Billy Bo guitar and his famous 1959 Gibson Les Paul guitar known as Pearly Gates. Gibbons has a bass vocal range, spanning E♭1 to E♭5, one of the widest ranges in rock. He is noted for formerly using an old five peso Mexican coin as a guitar pick and use of pinch harmonics in his solos.\\n\\nGibbons is a familiar fixture at the Sunset Marquis Hotel, producing studio sessions in the NightBird Recording Studio with actors Billy Bob Thornton and J.P. Shellnutt, along with musicians Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, Jed Leiber, Joe Fazzio, and Dwight Yoakam. Gibbons is also well known for his authentic preparations of Texas-style barbecue and Mexican cuisine and is frequently a guest chef around Hollywood, California serving his famous \"Renegade Guacamole\".\\n\\nIn May 2011, it was announced that Gibbons was named as the 2012 Texas State Musician by the Texas Commission on the Arts. Gibbons was ranked thirty-second in Rolling Stone magazine\\'s list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" in 2011.\\n\\nGibbons was born to Frederick Royal (Freddie) and Lorraine Gibbons in the Tanglewood suburb of Houston, Texas. His father was an entertainer, orchestra conductor, and concert pianist who worked alongside second cousin, art director Cedric Gibbons, for Samuel Goldwyn at MGM Studios. In 1963, Gibbons received his first electric guitar following his thirteenth birthday, a sunburst Gibson Melody Maker, accompanied with a Fender Champ amplifier and was influenced by guitarists such as Jimmy Reed. While attending Warner Brothers\\' art school in Hollywood, California, Gibbons engaged with his first bands including The Saints, Billy G & the Blueflames, and The Coachmen. By 18, Gibbons went forward forming an artfully designed band, conceptually inspired by friend and fellow musician, Roky Erickson and The 13th Floor Elevators, naming the group The Moving Sidewalks, penning the hit single, \"99th Floor\" and engaging a friendship with Jimi Hendrix. Hendrix went on to say on The Tonight Show that Gibbons would be the next hottest guitarist.\\n\\nMoving Sidewalks:\\nGibbons founded the Texas psychedelic group The Moving Sidewalks, which recorded several singles and one full-length album, Flash. Gibbons and The Moving Sidewalks came to prominence opening for The Jimi Hendrix Experience during Hendrix\\'s first American tour as a headliner. Also notable was the Gibbons-penned song, \"99th Floor,\" its title a nod to the influence on Gibbons of fellow Texans and pioneering psychedelic band The 13th Floor Elevators. Gibbons has also commented during live performances while playing the string-bending intro to \"Foxy Lady\" that Hendrix taught him how to play the song when Gibbons was \"about 17\" in Dallas. Longstanding rumors have it that at the end of the tour Hendrix gave Gibbons the pink Stratocaster he had been playing as token of his appreciation for Gibbons\\' level of talent, and that Hendrix subsequently stated that Gibbons was one of the best guitarists in the US.\\n\\nZZ Top:\\nGibbons formed ZZ Top in late 1969, which then quickly settled on bassist/vocalist Dusty Hill and drummer Frank Beard, both being members of the band American Blues. After honing their trademark blues-rock style, they released the aptly titled ZZ Top\\'s First Album on London Records in 1971.\\n\\nThe band rolled on, intensively touring and recording/releasing albums until 1977, when they took an extended hiatus. Their long-time manager took this time to negotiate a deal that allowed the band to keep control of their previous recordings, to be distributed by their new label, Warner Bros. Records. They reunited two-and-a-half years later in order to start recording under a new Warner Bros. contract. Unknown to each other at the time, both Dusty Hill and Billy Gibbons had grown the chest-length beards that quickly became a part of their image.\\n\\nThe band hit international prominence and their commercial peak with the release of 1983\\'s diamond-selling disc Eliminator. Eliminator was named after Gibbons\\' customized 1933 Ford Coupé, which was featured in three of the band\\'s music videos. This vehicle is on exhibition at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. The album featured the hits \"Gimme All Your Lovin\\'\", \"Sharp Dressed Man\", and \"Legs\".\\n\\nIn 1994, the band signed a multi-million dollar, five-disc deal with RCA Records.\\n\\nIn 2003, a comprehensive collection of recordings from the London and Warner Bros. years entitled Chrome, Smoke & BBQ was released. In 2004, ZZ Top was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. They have the distinction of being among a very small group of bands with a 40-year-plus history that still has all of its original members.\\n\\nOther music-related appearances:\\nGibbons played the first slide guitar lead on the song \"Dead End Streets\" on Al Jourgensen of Ministry\\'s side project Revolting Cocks album Cocked and Loaded. He also wrote, played guitar on and sang the song \"Willin\\' For Satisfaction\" from Def Leppard guitarist Vivian Campbell\\'s 2005 solo album Two Sides Of If.\\n\\nGibbons collaborated with the Queens of the Stone Age on the song \"Burn the Witch\" from the album Lullabies to Paralyze. ZZ Top\\'s \"Precious and Grace\" was also recorded with lead vocals provided by Mark Lanegan as a bonus track for the album. Gibbons has also claimed this was one of his favorite collaborations and \"Precious and Grace\" was later added back into ZZ Top\\'s set lists. Gibbons was also selected to guest the follow-up album Era Vulgaris but was unable to due to scheduling conflicts.\\n\\nTogether with The Raconteurs Gibbons performed at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards. Gibbons was part of an ensemble chosen to play with the band, which included Lou Reed and Jim Jarmusch. The performance was heavily edited and cut short by MTV for broadcast. However, the full unedited performance is available on MTV\\'s Website for the VMAs. Although not a full-length performance, Gibbons can also be heard playing a few bars of the ZZ Top classic \"La Grange.\"\\n\\nGibbons can be seen among the crowd at the WWF/E November 13, 2001 live Smackdown show from Houston.\\n\\nGibbons was one of several artists to participate together with B.B. King on the song \"Tired Of Your Jive,\" from the B.B. King & Friends album. Gibbons also appeared on Nickelback\\'s album All the Right Reasons on the songs \"Follow You Home,\" \"Fight for All the Wrong Reasons\" and \"Rockstar.\"\\n\\nGibbons performed with country legend Hank Williams\\'s grandson Hank Williams III on the song \"Trashville,\" from his album Lovesick, Broke and Driftin\\'.\\n\\nGibbons also collaborated with the original designer of his favorite guitar \"Miss Pearly Gates\" Lester William Polsfuss aka Les Paul with his Les Paul & Friends American Made, World Played track \"Bad Case of Loving You.\" Gibbons also performed guitar with John Mayall & Friends\\' track \"Put It Right Back\" from the album Along for the Ride.\\n\\nGibbons was the first artist to appear on stage at Cleveland\\'s State theater in November 2008 at the American Music Master Tribute to Les Paul, honoring the guitar and recording innovator. Featured guests were a who\\'s who of American Axmen, including Steve Lukather, Lonnie Mack, Duanne Eddy, Richard Burton, The Ventures, Ritchie Sambora, Jeff Baxter, Lenny Kaye, and Slash. A fitting tribute to the old master who passed away a few short months after this memorable night.\\n\\nGibbons was also a guest vocalist on Kid Rock\\'s \"Hillbilly Stomp\" from the album Kid Rock.\\n\\nGibbons was also the guitarist during singer Luis Fonsi\\'s presentation at the 7th Latin Grammy awards held in Madison Square Garden, New York, on November 2, 2006. Lately Gibbons also sang background vocals on former Van Halen frontman Sammy Hagar\\'s 2008 CD Cosmic Universal Fashion during the song \"Switch on the Light.\"\\n\\nGibbons collaborated with Ronnie Dunn, of Brooks & Dunn fame, for Ronnie\\'s first solo work, playing guitar and singing along on the song, \"Honky Tonk Stomp\".\\n\\nHe played guitar on \"Broke Down On the Brazos\", the opening track of Gov\\'t Mule\\'s 2009 album By a Thread.\\n\\nGibbons played guitar on \"Run Rudolph Run\", the third track of We Wish you a Metal Xmas and a Headbanging New Year compilation.\\n\\nGibbons joined Jeff Beck onstage at the 2009 25th Anniversary Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Concert with a version of Jimi Hendrix\\'s \"Foxy Lady\".\\n\\nGibbons made a special guest appearance behind Roky Erickson on Austin City Limits taped on November 12, 2007 and originally aired January 12, 2008. (ACL Season 33, Episode 12)\\n\\nGibbons plays lead guitar on two songs from the 2008 Everlast album Love, War and the Ghost of Whitey Ford: \"Stone in My Hand\" and \"Anyone\".\\n\\nOn January 22, 2010, Gibbons joined Ben Harper, Beck, Conan O\\'Brien, and others on the final episode of The Tonight Show with Conan O\\'Brien playing a Will Ferrell-led rendition of Lynyrd Skynyrd\\'s \"Free Bird\".\\n\\nOn February 19, 2011, Gibbons appeared as a guest judge at the 5th Annual Misprint Beard and Moustache Contest at the Mohawk club in Austin, Texas.\\n\\nA remix from March 20, 2013 of \"Soothe My Soul\" for Depeche Mode appears as remixed by Billy Gibbons and Joe Hardy, Gold Star Sound Services, Houston / London\\n\\nOther projects:\\nGibbons has a recurring role on the Fox network TV series Bones. He plays a fictionalized version of himself, as the father of Michaela Conlin\\'s character, Angela Pearly Gates Montenegro. Conlin\\'s character\\'s middle name is the same as Gibbons\\' Les Paul guitar. Gibbons\\'s character is extremely protective of his daughter, and he often \"threatens\" or \"haunts\" Jack Hodgins, now her husband, telling him that if he hurts Angela, he will pay. When Angela and Hodgins first broke up he drugged and kidnapped Hodgins, during which time he also gave him a tattoo of Angela\\'s face. He has appeared in several episodes, including one where he asks Hodgins to help him recover his car from some \"biker hoods\". The next series he argued with Hodgins over baby names. At the end of the episode Hodgins discovers he has yet another tattoo, this time of his father in law. In a more recent episode he asks to baby sit his grandson Michael, and after initial reluctance of Angela and Hodgins, they agree due to the need to get some sleep as Michael won\\'t stop crying and won\\'t go to sleep. Gibbons solves the problem by discovering the music Michael likes, including Blues and Boogie Rock, such as ZZ Top\\'s Hi Fi Mama.\\n\\nGibbons voiced a character in episode 60 of Metalocalypse.\\n\\nBFG Brand sauces:\\nIn 2011, Gibbons joined with Texas-based Mojo Products, LLC to launch a line of hot sauces, barbecue sauces, and other products with his own personal branding, \"BFG Brand\".

Various BFG Brand sauces are briefly seen in the commercials.\\n\\nPersonal:\\nIn December 2005, Gibbons married long-time girlfriend Gilligan Stillwater.

Idol lived in Worthing before attending Sussex University for only a year before joining the Bromley Contingent of keen Sex Pistols fans. During this period, Idol decided to become a musician and formed a band called Generation X in 1976.\\n\\nGeneration X signed to Chrysalis Records and released three successful albums before breaking up. Idol moved to New York City and began working as a solo artist and working with Steve Stevens, soon becoming MTV staples with \"White Wedding\" and \"Dancing with Myself,\" the latter of which had originally been recorded with Generation X. Idol\\'s second LP, Rebel Yell (1983) was a blockbuster success, and established Idol\\'s superstar status in the USA with singles like \"Eyes Without A Face,\" \"Flesh For Fantasy,\" and the title cut.\\n\\nIdol did not release a new album until 1986; Whiplash Smile sold very well and proved to be a smash, including the hits \"To Be A Lover,\" \"Don\\'t Need A Gun,\" and the Country-flavored \"Sweet Sixteen.\" Stevens soon left for a solo career and Idol continued. A live cover of Tommy James\\' \"Mony Mony\" (the studio version of which was an Idol staple from early on) did well on MTV. Just before the release of Charmed Life in 1990, Idol was in a motorcycle accident in which he almost lost his leg.

       " 'Billy J. Kramer (born William Howard Ashton, 19 August 1943, in Bootle, Liverpool, England) was a British Invasion / Merseybeat singer. He is known today primarily as the singer of various Lennon-McCartney compositions that The Beatles did not use.\\n\\nThe performing name Kramer was chosen at random from a telephone directory. It was John Lennon\\'s suggestion that the \"J\" be added to the name to further distinguish him by adding a \\'tougher edge\\'. Billy soon came to the attention of Brian Epstein, ever on the look-out for new talent to add to his expanding roster of local artists. Kramer turned professional but his then backing band, The Coasters were less keen, so Epstein sought out the services of a Manchester based band, The Dakotas, a well-respected combo then backing Pete MacLaine.\\n\\nEven then, the Dakotas would not join Kramer wihout a recording deal of their own. Once in place, the deal was set and both acts signed to Parlophone under George Martin. Collectively, they were named Billy J. Kramer with The Dakotas to keep their own identities within the act. Once the Beatles broke through, the way was paved for a tide of \"Merseybeat\" and Kramer was offered the chance to cover a song first released by the Beatles on their own debut album, Please Please Me. The track had been allegedly turned down by Shane Fenton (later Alvin Stardust) who was looking for a career reviving hit.\\n\\nWith record producer George Martin, the song \"Do You Want to Know a Secret?\" was a number two UK Singles Chart hit in 1963, and was backed by another tune otherwise unreleased by The Beatles, \"I\\'ll Be on My Way\". After this impressive breakthrough another Lennon/McCartney pairing \"Bad To Me\" c/w \"I Call Your Name\" reached number one. \"I\\'ll Keep You Satisfied\" ended the year with a respectable number four placing.\\n\\nBilly was given a series of songs specially written for him by the John Lennon and Paul McCartney which launched him into stardom and a proper place in the history of Rock and Roll. I\\'ll Keep You Satisfied, From A Window, I Call Your Name and Bad To Me all became international million sellers for Billy, and won him appearances on the TV shows Shindig!, Hullabaloo and The Ed Sullivan Show.\\n\\nThe Dakotas, meanwhile, enjoyed Top 20 success in 1963 on their own with Mike Maxfield\\'s composition \"The Cruel Sea\", an instrumental retitled \"The Cruel Surf\" in the U.S., which was subsequently covered by The Ventures. This was followed by a George Martin creation, \"Magic Carpet\", evoking a dreamy atmosphere with a subtle echo laden piano, playing the melody alongside Maxfield\\'s guitar. But it missed out altogether and it was a year before their next release. All four tracks appeared on a highly-collectable EP later that year.\\n\\nThe three big hits penned by Lennon and McCartney meant that Kramer was always seemingly in the Beatles\\' shadow, unless he tried something different. Despite being advised against it, he insisted on recording the Stateside chart hit \"Little Children\" - the lyrics were allegedly about getting his girlfriend\\'s brothers and sisters out of the way so they could make love. It became his second chart topper and biggest hit. It was Kramer\\'s only major hit outside of the UK. In the U.S., this was followed up with \"Bad to Me\" which reached number nine. Despite this success Kramer went backwards with his second and last UK single of 1964; another Lennon/McCartney cast-off \"From A Window\", which only became a Top Ten hit.\\n\\nThe year 1965 saw the end for the Merseybeat boom, and the next Kramer single was \"It\\'s Gotta Last Forever\", which harked back to a ballad approach. In a year where mod-related music from the likes of The Who prevailed, the single missed completely. Kramer\\'s cover of \"Trains and Boats and Planes\" saw off Anita Harris\\' cover version only to find itself in direct competition with its composer, Burt Bacharach\\'s effort, which won the day. Kramer\\'s effort still reached a respectable number 12, but was the group\\'s swansong, as all future cuts missed the chart.\\n\\nThe Dakotas ranks were then strengthened by the inclusion of Mick Green, the ex-guitarist with the London band the Pirates who backed Johnny Kidd. This line-up cut a few tracks which were at odds with the balladeer\\'s usual fare. These included a take on \"When You Walk in the Room\" and \"Sneakin\\' Around\". The Dakotas final outing whilst with Kramer was the blues driven \"Oyeh!\" - but this also flopped.\\n\\nAfter releasing \"We\\'re Doing Fine\", it too missed the charts leaving singer and group to part company. Kramer had a brief solo career which took him eventually to live in America.\\n\\nThe Dakotas re-formed in the late 1980s and recruited vocalist Eddie Mooney and session musician Toni Baker. They still tour and record today. Drummer Pete Hilton joined the band in 1996 replacing Tony Bookbinder and after Mike maxfield sufferred a stroke in 2004 guitarist Alan Clare along. In January 2008 Eddie was asked to replace Rod Allen, the Fortunes frontman who had sadly died in Dec 2007. Another new face now fronts The Dakotas - Paul Rafferty.\\n\\nIn 2005, Kramer recorded the song \"Cow Planet\" for Sandra Boynton\\'s children\\'s album, Dog Train. A long-time fan of Kramer\\'s, Boynton had sought him out for her project: in 1964, at age 11, she had bought Little Children as the first album she ever owned. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Billy+J.+Kramer+&+The+Dakotas\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Billy Joe Royal (April 3, 1942 – October 6, 2015) was an American pop and country singer.\\n\\nBorn in Valdosta, Georgia, and raised in Marietta, Georgia, Royal became a local star at the Bamboo Ranch in Savannah in the 1950s and 1960s. He is best known for the 1965 US Top 10 pop hit \"Down in the Boondocks\", which, along with the singles \"I Knew You When\" (Top 20, 1965) and \"Hush\" (1967), were written and produced by Joe South. Another South composition, \"Yo-Yo,\" just missed the top 40 in Canada and charted poorly in the U.S. when Royal released it in 1967, but a later remake by The Osmonds was a much greater success. His 1969 single, \"Cherry Hill Park\", peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100. In the 1970s his recording of \"Heart\\'s Desire\" gained popularity among Northern soul enthusiasts and was regularly played in Northern soul nightclubs.\\n\\nDuring the 1980s, Royal had a successful comeback with several Top 10 country hits, including \"Tell It Like It Is\", \"Burned Like a Rocket\", and \"I\\'ll Pin a Note on Your Pillow\".\\n\\nRoyal\\'s career experienced a second major period during the 2000s due to regular airplay on \"oldies\" radio stations.

       " ' Billy Lee Riley (born October 5, 1933 - August 2, 2009 ) was a first generation Rockabilly musician, singer, record producer and songwriter who died in Jonesboro Arkansas.\\n\\nBorn in Pocahontas, Arkansas, the son of a sharecropper, Riley learned to play guitar from black farm workers. After 4 years in the Army, Riley first recorded in Memphis, Tennessee in 1955 before being lured to Sun Studios by Sam Phillips. He recorded \"Trouble Bound\" for Jack Clement and Slim Wallace. Sam Phillips obtained the rights and he released \"Trouble Bound\" b/w \"\"Rock With Me Baby\" September 1,1956 (Sun 245). His first hit was \"Flyin\\' Saucers Rock and Roll\" b/w \"I Want You Baby\" released February 23,1957 (Sun 260) after which he recorded \"\"Red Hot\" b/w \"Pearly Lee\" released September 30,1957 (Sun 277) both with backing piano by Jerry Lee Lewis.\\n\\nRiley was drawn to the Memphis area in 1954 on the heels of Elvis Presley\\'s success. Riley began performing on KWEM Radio Station in West Memphis, Arkansas along with another Arkansas native, Johnny Cash, who had his own show on KWEM in 1955.\\n\\n\"Red Hot\" was showing a lot of promise as a big hit record, but Sam Phillips pulled the promotion and switched it to \"Great Balls Of Fire\" by Jerry Lee Lewis. The record was pulled without a lot of sales. He had other Sun recordings and they, likewise, did not have a lot of sales as his promotion had stopped.\\n\\nConsidered good looking and with wild stage moves, Riley had a brief solo career with his backing band \"The Little Green Men\". Riley and his Little Green Men were the main Sun studio band. They were Riley, Roland Janes, J.M. Van Eaton, Marvin Pepper, and Jimmy Wilson, later joined by Martin Willis.\\n\\nIn 1960, he left Sun, and started Rita Record label with Roland Janes. They produced the national hit record \"Mountain Of Love\" by Harold Dorman. He later started two other labels Nita and Mojo.\\n\\nIn 1962, he moved to Los Angeles and worked as a session musician with Dean Martin, the Beach Boys, Herb Alpert, Sammy Davis Jr. and others, as well as recording under various aliases.\\n\\nIn the early seventies, Riley quit music to return to Arkansas to begin his own construction business. In 1978 \"Red Hot\" and \"Flyin\\' Saucers Rock \\'n\\' Roll\" were covered by Robert Gordon and Link Wray respectively, which led to a one-off performance in Memphis in 1979, the success of which led to further recording at Sun Studio and a full-time return to performing.\\n\\nRediscovered by Bob Dylan in 1992, who had been a fan since 1956, Riley plays Rock and Roll, Blues and Country-Blues.\\n\\nHis album Hot Damn! (Capricorn, 1997) was nominated for the Grammy.\\n\\nHe was injured falling on a slippery department store floor in 2005 and that has required two surgeries, but he still is performing successfully worldwide in 2007. In 2006, he released a country CD, Hillbilly Rockin\\' Man.\\n\\nThe sky grew dimmer on Sunday, as another great ray of light from the Sun Records roster, Billy Lee Riley, died. Riley, who\\'d been battling cancer since May, died August 2, 2009, at St. Bernards Medical Center in Jonesboro, Ark., after being admitted on Saturday. He was 75.\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Lee+Riley\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Billy Ocean (born Leslie Sebastian Charles, 21 January 1950, Fyzabad, Trinidad) is a Grammy Award-winning British popular music performer who had a string of rhythm and blues-tinged international pop hits in the 1970s and 1980s. He was the main British R&B singer / songwriter of the 1980s. He waited seven years after scoring his first four UK top 20 successes, before accumulating a series of transatlantic successes, including three U.S. number ones.\\n\\nHe was born in Fyzabad, Trinidad and Tobago to Grenadian parents, and moved to England with his family at the age of eight. Oceans\\' musical influence came at an early age of his life, as his father was a musician, and realised he was inline to follow those ambitions as he was growing up. During his teenage years, he sang regularly in London clubs while also working as a tailor in London\\'s Savile Row. He released his first single in 1972 on Spark Records as Les Charles.\\n\\nWhen in Trinidad as a boy he adopted the name Billy Ocean, taking the surname from the local football team \\'Ocean\\'s Eleven\\', who had gotten the name from the famous film of the same name. The next year, 1976, was when he recorded his first album, Billy Ocean, with its first single release, \"Love Really Hurts Without You,\" charting at number 2 in the UK Singles Chart and number 22 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. More successes ensued, including \"L.O.D. (Love On Delivery)\". He also wrote songs for other artists, such as La Toya Jackson. In 1981, he scored the U.S. R&B chart with \"Nights (Feel Like Getting Down)\".\\n\\nOcean\\'s period of greatest success began with Suddenly during 1984, and its main single, \"Caribbean Queen\". The song\\'s title and lyrics were changed for different regions, such that the song is also known as \"African Queen\" or \"European Queen\". The song won Ocean the Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance at the 1985 Grammy Awards. The album\\'s title track also became a success, its score maximizing at #4 in both the US and the UK; and the song \"Loverboy\", while also being a #2 US success during 1985, from the album, was also the background music for the first scene of the popular UK BBC One TV series, Casualty, during 1986.\\n\\nOcean appeared at Live Aid in 1985, singing \"Caribbean Queen\" and \"Loverboy\", from the JFK Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\\n\\nHis 1986 album Love Zone also sold well. It included the successful singles \"When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going\" (the theme from the film The Jewel of the Nile); this was a number one success in the UK and a number two in the U.S.; and \"There\\'ll Be Sad Songs (To Make You Cry)\" (a U.S. number one, and also a major UK success). Also included were the title track and \"Love Is Forever\", which were #10 and #16 U.S. successes for Ocean, respectively.\\n\\nIn February 1986, Ocean\\'s video of \"When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going\" was banned by the BBC, owing to non-union members (including Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito) miming to backing vocals.\\n\\nOcean\\'s next album, Tear Down These Walls (1988) featured another number one single, \"Get Outta My Dreams, Get into My Car\", while the album was certified platinum.\\n\\nHis 1993 album Time to Move On failed to produce any major successes, but his 1989 Greatest Hits collection has been a steady seller over the years, and his 1997 compilation Love Is For Ever made #7 on the UK album chart. Ocean\\'s last studio album for Jive Records was Time to Move On, which he recorded in Chicago with R&B star R. Kelly. It turned out that R. Kelly had been a long-time admirer of the way Ocean was able to mix the more emotive soul style with a crossover popular style.\\n\\nIn 2002, the University of Westminster awarded Ocean an honorary doctorate of music. The awards ceremony took place in the Barbican Centre, in London. He continues to tour and record in Europe. He lives in Sunningdale, Berkshire with his wife of 27 years, Judy; and their three children Cherie, Antony and Rachel. Ocean is now a patron for Tech Music Schools in London, made up of Drumtech, Vocaltech, Guitar-X and Keyboardtech. He regularly visits to hold clinics and seminars for the students.\\n\\nIn October 2007, Ocean commenced his first British tour in over 15 years. In February and March 2008 he toured Australia and the Far East. His new album, Because I Love You was released on 2 February 2009. To coincide with this new tour and album launch, Ocean has been working with Adoseof Design on a website revision which is due March 2009.\\n\\nFor more information got to:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Ocean <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Ocean\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Billy Paul (Paul Williams; December 1, 1934 – April 24, 2016) was a Grammy Award winning American soul singer, most known for his 1972 number-one single, \"Me and Mrs. Jones\", as well as the 1973 album and single \"War of the Gods\" which blends his more conventional pop, soul and funk styles with electronic and psychedelic influences.\\n\\nHe was one of the many artists associated with the Philadelphia soul sound created by Kenny Gamble, Leon Huff, and Thom Bell. Paul is usually identified by his diverse vocal style which ranges from mellow and soulful to low and raspy. Questlove of The Roots has equated Paul to Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder, calling him \"one of the criminally unmentioned proprietors of socially conscious post-revolution \\'60s civil rights music.\"\\n\\nBorn and raised in North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Paul\\'s love of music began at a young age listening at home to his family\\'s collection of 78s. He recalled: \"That\\'s how I really got indoctrinated into music. My mother was always...collecting records and she would buy everything from Jazz at Philharmonic Hall to Nat King Cole.\" He began singing along and tried to emulate the records he heard: \"I always liked Nat King Cole. I always wanted to go my own way, but I always favored other singers like Dinah Washington, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald - I loved Ella Fitzgerald. There are so many of them. Nina Simone was one of my favorites - Johnny Mathis, They all had a style, a silkiness about them.... I wanted to sing silky, like butter – mellow. I wanted to sing mellow you know what I mean. One of my favorites is Jessie Velvet - they used to call him Mr. Easy. A lot of people forgot about him you know - Sam Cooke is another one of my favorites.\"\\n\\n\\nBilly Paul was heavily influenced by female jazz vocalists, perhaps none more than Billie Holiday.\\nPaul explained why he was particularly influenced by female jazz singers: \"I think the reason behind that is because of my high range. The male singers who had the same range I did, when I was growing up, didn\\'t do much for me. But put on Nina Simone, Carmen McRae or Nancy Wilson, and I\\'d be in seventh heaven. Female vocalists just did more with their voices, and that\\'s why I paid more attention to them.\" Perhaps the female vocalist that had the most impact on Paul was Billie Holiday who he called \"a BIG influence.\" Paul began developing a vocal style that would eventually incorporate traces of jazz, R&B and pop.\\n\\nPaul began his singing career at age eleven, appearing on local radio station WPEN, then owned by the local Philadelphia Bulletin newspaper.[2] Paul attended the West Philadelphia Music School and the Granoff School of Music for formal vocal training. He recalled: \"Well you know, it was something that my mum would say I needed Holding my notes you know, and delivering my notes. It gave me assurity, cos my mother was 100% behind me and it created the style and uniqueness of Billy Paul. All my life I wanted to sound like myself, I never wanted to sound like anybody else. How that occurred was cause I always wanted to be a saxophone player.... I took my uniqueness and treated it like a horn, which created a good style for me.\"\\n\\n\"When I was 16, I played the Club Harlem in Philly and I was on the same bill as Charlie Parker. He died later that year. I was there with him for a week and I learned what it would normally take two years to pick up. Bird told me if I kept struggling I\\'d go a long way, and I\\'ve never forgotten his words.\" -Billy Paul\\n\\nPaul\\'s popularity grew and led to appearances in clubs and at college campuses nationally. This led to further opportunities, appearing in concert with Charlie Parker, Dinah Washington, Nina Simone, Miles Davis, The Impressions, Sammy Davis, Jr. and Roberta Flack. He also changed his name from Paul Williams to Billy Paul so as to avoid any confusion with other artists such as songwriter Paul Williams and saxophonist Paul \"Hucklebuck\" Williams. He explained: \"I had Jules Malvin, who was like my play father. He was my manager at the time. He took me up to the Apollo and I warmed the Apollo for six weeks and that’s where he gave me the name Billy Paul. I didn\\'t question it.\"\\n\\nFirst recordings\\nIn 1952 he traveled to New York City and entered the recording studio for Jubilee Records. Backed by Tadd Dameron on piano and Jackie Davis on the Hammond organ, the first single Paul released that April was \"Why Am I\" with \"That\\'s Why I Dream\" as the B-side (Jubilee Records 5081, both written by Bernard Sacks and B. Sidney Zeff). Billboard reviewed the tracks favorably saying of \"Why Am I\" - \"Expressive warbling of a moody ballad, by the label\\'s new 16-year-old chanter\" and of \"That\\'s Why I Dream\" - \"Organ and piano lend the singer a hand in this slow-paced etching of a romantic number\".\\n\\nA few months later in June 1952, Paul released his second single - this time collaborating with the Buddy Lucas Orchestra - \"You Didn\\'t Know\" backed with \"The Stars Are Mine\" (Jubilee Records 5086). Billboard was again positive saying about \"You Didn\\'t Know\" - \"Billy Paul, new young singer, makes an impressive bow on the label with a strong performance of a weeper ballad which should pick up spins and plays. The Lucas ork furnishes okay backing. A good disk\" and about \"The Stars Are Mine\" - \"Paul sings this new tune more quietly, over a smooth ork reading. Side is not as exciting as flip and tune is not as strong.\" A few weeks later, Jubilee took out an ad in Billboard to promote their artists in anticipation of the annual NAMM Show - the music industry trade convention put on by the National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM). Jubilee plugged Paul\\'s latest single and noted: \"He\\'s New - He\\'s Hot!\" Despite Jubilee\\'s efforts, none of the tracks by the young singer made the charts.\\n\\nBilly Paul served with Elvis Presley and a number of other musicians in post-World War II Germany.\\nPaul\\'s career took an unexpected turn when he was drafted into the Armed Services. He recalled:\\n\\n\"I went in, in 1957, and I was stationed with Elvis Presley and Gary Crosby - Bing Crosby\\'s son. We were in Germany and we said we\\'re going to start a band, so we didn’t have to do any hard work in the service. We tried to get Elvis to join but he wanted to be a jeep driver. So me and Gary Crosby, we started it and called ourselves the Jazz Blues Symphony Band. Some famous people came out of that band; Cedar Walton, Eddie Harris and we toured all over Germany. Elvis didn’t wanna join us. I used to see him every day but he drove the jeep for the Colonel. He didn’t want to join our band. He wanted to get away from music for a while, while he was in the service you know.\\n\\nPaul and the other members of the 7th Army Band including Don Ellis, Leo Wright, and Ron Anthony used the service to further their musical careers as best they could—ones they knew would continue once they returned to civilian life. Paul said: \"I sang in the service, I sang with a jazz band. So when I came out I sang Jazz, going to clubs and so forth.\"\\n\\nPaul also did some boxing in the Army - a sport he had grown up with as he explained in a 2012 interview: \"Yeah we had a gym and all my friends from my neighborhood were boxers. Even during my army days I boxed as well as singing. Actually I still go to the gym; both me and my wife have trainers... Miles Davis would always say: \\'Come to the gym! I\\'m gonna beat your ass!\\' Then one time I got hit too hard and I said no I\\'m going to sing!... That made my mind up.\"\\n\\nAfter his discharge, Paul formed a jazz trio with hard bop pianist Sam Dockery and bassist Buster Williams. In 1959 he joined the New Dawn record label and released the single \"Ebony Woman\" backed with \"You\\'ll Go to Hell\" (New Dawn 1001) both written by Morris Bailey Jr. In 1960, Paul recorded \"There\\'s a Small Hotel\" (Finch 1005, written by Rodgers and Hart) backed with \"I’m Always A Brother\" (Finch 1006, written by Leon Mitchell and Charles Gaston). None of these songs charted but Paul would resurrect and re-record both \"Ebony Woman\" and \"There\\'s a Small Hotel\" in later years.\\n\\nPaul was a brief stand in for one of the ailing Blue Notes with Harold Melvin. Paul remembered: \"Well, I didn’t want to dance so Harold Melvin fired me (laughs). I had a six month stay with The Flamingos - I was with The Flamingos for a while.\" It was around this time that Paul established a lifelong friendship with Marvin Gaye—both singers filling in with other groups. Paul recalled: \"I was one of the Blue Notes at one time and Marvin Gaye was in The Moonglows.... We were such good friends. We never did a record together and that would have been one of my dreams. And you know what one of my fascinations is? What we would be doing if he were here today. I think about Marvin every day. The love I have for this man is unbelievable. We were close, we were like brothers. When I would go on the road out in California, he would go round to the house - he and Blanche (Billy\\'s wife) [would] make sure Blanche’s mother would take her insulin because she was a diabetic. I would heavily depend on him to make sure she ate and took her insulin. That’s how close we were. You know sometimes, even today. I wake up and hope it was a dream, but it’s real – it’s real you know.\"\\n\\nIn 2012, Paul was asked how important the city of Philadelphia is to him and what the Philly sound is: \"It\\'s very very important to me. I was born here and so many great and influential artists come from here as well. Its a city of its own and has its own sound. I think what makes it different is the drama; you know how they say everyone marches to their own beat? Well i think Philly has its own beat as well, and it\\'s distinctive. It sounds easy, but it\\'s hard to play.\"\\n\\nPaul and his wife and manager Blanche Williams were in the process of recording his debut album when they met Kenny Gamble. Paul recalled:\\n\\nBilly Paul has cited The Beatles as the key influence on his musical growth from jazz to other musical genres.\\n\"I was singing in a jazz club called the Sahara. He had a record shop on South St & Philly - right round the corner and I was singing with a trio at the Sahara club on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. He came over and said \\'I am starting a record company and I would like to sign you.\\' Low and behold I took all the material I sung every weekend and I did an album in three and a half hours - a whole album. I had this album, and I produced it - me and my wife. And we gave him this album called Feelin\\' Good at the Cadillac Club to help start the record company and that was the album that helped start it up. I was singing totally Jazz then, but when I heard The Beatles and heard the gospel influence and everything I just said: \\'I can make jazz with R&B.\\' That transition came when The Beatles came out to America. When I heard The Beatles that was my turning point. They were like my mentors. You know the funny thing about that, when I heard (Billy sings) \\'I Wanna Hold Your Hand,\\' at first I said these guys are like a flash in the pan. But the second album when they started doing all this, I had to like take all that back. John Lennon - one of the greatest writers in the world.\"\\n\\nPaul\\'s debut album Feelin\\' Good at the Cadillac Club was released in 1968 on the Gamble label. Largely a collection of jazz covers of songs popularized by others, it was a studio album that attempted to recreate the feel of Paul\\'s live club performances. Neither the single \"Bluesette\" nor the album reached the charts.\\n\\nPaul\\'s second LP Ebony Woman (1970), was a more commercial release on Gamble & Huff\\'s Neptune label. Paul cut a new version of his 1959 single and made it the title track. Gamble & Huff were firmly in control of the production. Merging jazz and soul, the LP achieved some modest success reaching #12 on the Billboard soul chart and #183 on the pop chart.\\n\\nPhiladelphia International releases\\nAfter Neptune folded, Gamble & Huff started their third label - Philadelphia International Records (PIR) - and brought Paul with them. Gamble & Huff signed a distribution deal with Clive Davis and CBS Records hoping to reach the broad audience that they were unable to with their previous independent labels.\\n\\nGoing East (1971) was the first Billy Paul album released on the Philadelphia International Records label, making full use of the label\\'s regular group of ace musicians MFSB at Sigma Sound Studios. As they had done on the previous LP, Gamble & Huff sought to find the balance between Paul\\'s jazz roots and the funky soul that they hoped would bring mainstream success. Paul nearly reached the charts with the single \"Magic Carpet Ride\" (a different song than the 1968 Steppenwolf hit) and the album climbed to #42 on the Billboard soul chart and #197 on the pop chart.\\n\\n\"The good thing about Gamble & Huff is, nobody sounded alike, everybody had their own sound and that was the distinctive part that kept coming. -Billy Paul\\n\\n\"Me and Mrs. Jones\" and international fame\\n\\nWith each album, Gamble & Huff were moving closer to realizing the sound they envisioned for Paul and with the 1972 LP 360 Degrees of Billy Paul and the single \"Me and Mrs. Jones\" they achieved it. Both the album and song received commercial and critical recognition.\\n\\n\"Me and Mrs. Jones\" was a No. 1 hit for the last three weeks of 1972, selling two million copies (platinum single status), and went on to win Paul a Grammy Award. The gold album and platinum single broke the artist on world charts, including the United Kingdom where the single entered the Top 20 of the UK Singles Chart reaching number 12 in early 1973. In the years since then, the song has been covered numerous times, most notably by Freddie Jackson in 1992 and Michael Bublé in 2007. Paul recalled the Grammy win and the song\\'s overall success: \"Oh man! I was up against Ray Charles, I was up against Curtis Mayfield, I was up against Isaac Hayes. I was in the Wilberforce University in Ohio, I had to go do a homecoming - my wife and her mother went. And when I see Ringo Starr call my name, I said Ohhh... Yeah... The most sobering thing is to have a number one record across the whole entire world in all languages. It’s a masterpiece, it’s a classic.\"\\n\\nThe song was PIR\\'s first No. 1. In addition, the label was enjoying considerable success with their other artists including the O\\'Jays and Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes. Paul remembered the atmosphere at the label: \"It was like a family full of music. It was like music round the clock, you know.\"\\n\\nMusic executive Clive Davis has consistently praised Paul\\'s recording of \"Am I Black Enough for You?\".\\n\"Am I Black Enough\" controversy\\nBut Paul\\'s massive success was short lived. The follow-up single - \"Am I Black Enough for You?\" failed to reach the heights of \"Mrs. Jones\" with the song\\'s Black Power political message proving too much for mainstream radio\\'s taste. There was and continues to be much controversy surrounding the choice to release this track as the follow-up to a cross-over smash hit.\\n\\nIn a 1977 interview, Paul made plain that he opposed the choice from the beginning:\\n\\n\"I think though that a lot of mistakes were made at the time. The biggest one was releasing \\'Am I Black Enough For You\\' straight after \\'Mrs. Jones\\'. People weren\\'t ready for that kind of a song after the pop success of \\'Mrs. Jones\\'. They were looking for a sequel or at least something that wasn\\'t provocative. You\\'ll remember at the time that I told you I was 100% against it and history has proven me right. But though it was a company mistake, I\\'m still satisfied with both CBS and Philadelphia International.\"\\n\\nDecades later, Paul was more philosophical about the song: \"That was what I had with \\'Am I Black Enough.\\' I wanted - I\\'m gonna make it this time and come out. I think it\\'s true to the audience, cos they look for something to come out compared to Mrs. Jones and that was Clive Davis\\' idea to do that. I think it was Kenny and Clive Davis, but I think it was mostly Clive Davis.\"[3] For his part, Davis has said that he opposed releasing the song as a single. Still, Davis called it an \"all time great record, all time great performance.\". Gamble, the co-writer and producer of the track, said the song \"was great and Billy sounded great doing it.\". Paul reflected: \"Well you know... For a long time I was angry about it, I had a bit of a letdown. Now the song is ahead of its time. I feel as though I let the song down when I went into my darkness. I feel like I abandoned the song. And I\\'m still going to get to the bottom of \\'Am I Black Enough.\\'\"\\n\\nWe\\'re gonna move on up\\nOne by one\\nWe ain\\'t gonna stop\\nUntil the work is done\\n\\nUltimately, 360 Degrees of Billy Paul reached #1 on the Billboard soul chart and #17 on the pop chart. Despite the disappointment over the chart performance of the \"Am I Black Enough\" single, there was no reason to believe that Paul could not replicate the album\\'s success or reach even greater heights. In May 1973, while still promoting the 360 Degrees of Billy Paul album, he was asked about a follow-up LP: \"I\\'m afraid that there will be something of a delay. As of right now, there are two sides actually completed. I have to tell you about one of them — Kenny and Leon wrote it especially and it\\'s a definite single at some point. It\\'s called \"I Was Married\" and I honestly think it will be bigger than \"Me and Mrs. Jones.\" But for me, there are still two singles from the 360 Degrees of Billy Paul|360 Degrees album — \"Brown Baby\" and \"I\\'m Just A Prisoner\", But, we are starting to work on the album more seriously from May 15.\" Despite Paul\\'s enthusiasm, neither \"Brown Baby\" or \"I\\'m Just A Prisoner\" were released in U.S., although \"Brown Baby\" was issued in the U.K. but failed to chart there.\\n\\n\"Me and Mrs. Jones\" was such a huge hit that Gamble & Huff decided to re-release Paul\\'s first two albums Feelin\\' Good at the Cadillac Club and Ebony Woman. Reissued in 1973, both albums featured new cover art and were a boon to new fans hungry for Billy Paul product who had already purchased his first two PIR LPs. Still, neither reissue was terribly successful with only Ebony Woman re-entering the album charts at #186 Pop and #43 Soul.\\n\\nPaul\\'s next album War of the Gods was the follow-up to 360 Degrees of Billy Paul and was issued in November 1973. Unique in Paul\\'s catalog, it contains lengthy psychedelic soul, song suites and marked a conceptual and musical advance for Paul that did not go unrecognized by critics and fans. And while the LP and its singles enjoyed some success, Paul was unable to repeat the kind of wide impact he had with his previous album and \"Mrs. Jones\". The War of the Gods single \"Thanks for Saving My Life\", backed with \"I Was Married\" as the B-side, was a top 40 hit reaching #37 on the pop chart and a top-ten soul record reaching #9. It also reached #33 in the UK.\\n\\nPaul\\'s 1973 European tour with The O\\'Jays and The Intruders spawned Paul\\'s first true live album: Live in Europe. Recorded in London and released in 1974, it reached #10 on the Billboard Soul Album chart and #187 on Pop chart.\\n\\nGot My Head on Straight was released in 1975 and was an attempt to return to the successful formula of 360 Degrees of Billy Paul. A collection of jazzy, soulful, funky, pop songs it reached #140 on the Billboard Pop Album chart and #20 on the Soul chart. It included the singles \"Be Truthful to Me\" (#37 R&B); \"Billy\\'s Back Home\" (#52 R&B); and \"July, July, July, July\" which did not chart. Despite the attempted return to form, the lack of mainstream success was a major disappointment to Paul, Gamble & Huff, and everyone at PIR.\\n\\nBilly Paul was twice embroiled in controversy over the content of his songs with Reverend Jesse Jackson.\\nWhen Love is New followed in the same vein as its predecessor and had a similar fate. Released in December 1975, it reached #139 on the Billboard Pop Album chart and #17 on the Soul chart. It included the singles \"Let\\'s Make a Baby\" which hit #83 on the Pop singles chart (the last record of Paul\\'s to make that chart), #18 on the Soul chart, and #30 in the UK and \"People Power\" which reached #82 on the Soul chart and #14 on the U.S. Dance chart.\\n\\nCome on, come on, let\\'s make a baby\\nOh, baby, come on, come on\\nLet\\'s bring another life into this world\\nA little boy, a little girl\\nTake my hand while we walk slowly to the room\\nCan\\'t you see tonight I\\'m gonna make sweet, sweet love to you?\\n.... Let\\'s put wisdom in his head\\nSo he\\'ll never look back, he\\'ll look straight ahead\\nWe\\'ll teach him the truth and understand the meaning of it all\\nSo he can walk around with his head held tall\\n\\n\"Let\\'s Make a Baby\" proved controversial and there were calls to ban or alter the track because of its supposed obscene or negative message. Jesse Jackson and Operation PUSH led the movement against this and other songs such as Hall & Oates\\' \"Rich Girl\" and the Four Tops\\' \"Catfish.\" The campaign was waged locally with individual stations making their own choices about how to handle the matter. For example, leading R&B station WWRL in New York City played \"Let\\'s Make a Baby\" but decided not to announce its title. Other stations went so far as to alter the lyrics. Privately, several black disc jockeys described the controversy as \"Jessie\\'s phony crusade against sex on the air.\" The disc jockeys - who refused to allow their names to be used for fear of reprisals - accused Jackson of being \"absolutely dishonest\" about the campaign with one popular radio personality making reference to Richard Pryor\\'s 1975 appearance at one of Jackson\\'s events:\\n\\n\"This man suddenly discovered sexy recordings when several of our black recording artists began to stop performing for nothing at his annual Black Expos. Remember, this is the same Jackson who presented at one of his Black Expos the filthiest recording comedian in show business. And that comedian was filthy that night at the Amphitheater. It got so bad that parents and their children could be seen leaving the place.\"\\n\\nThe disc jockeys further pointed out that Jackson was not critical of other artists like Roberta Flack and The Brothers Johnson who had similarly suggestive songs like \"Jesse\" and \"Get the Funk Out of My Face\" but who were supporters of Operation PUSH. Several radio veterans were convinced that Jackson\\'s actions were little more than a publicity stunt calling it \"just another of his gimmicks, which he will soon drop for another, just to stay in the news.\"\\n\\nFor his part, Jackson responded the charges:\\n\\nWe have not...leveled \\'blasts at Billy Paul.\\' We have carefully and consciously avoided \\'blasts\\' at specific entertainers and instead have focused on specific records - of which Billy Paul\\'s \\'Let\\'s Make a Baby\\' is only one in a whole series, increasingly explicit and dominant in a market almost exclusively directed at children.... Love and romance are part of life and we are not suggesting that these subjects should be \\'censored\\' in record lyrics. Our appeal has been directed toward pornographic lyrics that degrade human sexuality rather than uplifting the human spirit. The lyrics change in Billy Paul\\'s record was decided upon independently by WVON radio. Mr. Paul has not protested to WVON about the change. The allegation that we have \\'suddenly discovered sexy records\\' because artists have stopped performing for nothing at PUSH EXPO is patently false.... The fact that several artists performed at EXPO who have songs we find objectionable is further evidence that our concerns are directed not at the artist but at the record.\\n\\n\\nBilly Paul paid homage to fallen civil rights leaders including Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X in his version of Paul McCartney\\'s 1976 hit \"Let \\'Em In.\\nSurprisingly, the controversy only escalated with the release of Paul\\'s next album Let \\'Em In in late 1976. The title track was a funky soul version of Paul McCartney\\'s #3 U.S. hit from earlier that summer. While McCartney\\'s version was heavy on personal references and comparatively light on political figures, Billy Paul\\'s version turned the formula on its head to become a kind of civil rights anthem - albeit one with a personal touch due to the mention of his recently deceased twin sister Pauline Williams. As where McCartney only obliquely refers to \"Brother John\" (John Lennon or brother-in-law John Eastman or John F. Kennedy) and \"Martin Luther\" (the martyred civil rights leader or the 16th Century theologian), Billy Paul\\'s version is far more explicit in reciting a list of deceased civil rights leaders (Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Jr., John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, Medgar Evers, and Louis Armstrong). Furthermore, interspersed with Billy Paul\\'s verses are memorable passages of speeches by Malcolm X and King.\\n\\nPauline Williams, Was my twin\\nElijah and Malcolm, Still our friends\\nBrother Martin, We can\\'t forget John\\nBobby and Medgar, Louis Armstrong!\\n\\nYet just as they had done with \"Let\\'s Make a Baby,\" WVON - Chicago\\'s oldest black-oriented radio station - altered the song. This time an engineer at the station spliced in a parts of a speech by Jesse Jackson as a substitute for parts of King\\'s speech.[13] Chicago Tribune columnist Gary Deeb said the station \"mutilated\" the song, did so in order to solidify ties with Jackson, and called the whole episode \"simply ridiculous.\" Paul was furious and said that he had the \"shock of my life\" when he learned of the alteration.\\n\\nReverend George Clements, the crusading pastor of Holy Angels Catholic Church on the South Side of Chicago presented Paul with an award for the song on Billy Paul Day, 23 May 1977 that included a ceremony at the church with the church\\'s school choir performing the song. When informed of the honor by Father Clements, Paul reportedly cried tears of joy. Clements said:\\n\\n\"In an age of cynicism, suspicion and outright despair, it\\'s uplifting to hear the kind of message that Billy Paul is giving all of us over the radio. Billy Paul is telling us that the dreamers, like Dr. Martin Luther King, are dead now, but it is time to let their dreams begin to come into our souls and begin to make an impact on our society. Congratulations to Billy Paul. Truly he has made a hit, not just with the general public, but also with Almighty God!\"\\n\\nIn all, Let \\'Em In was Paul\\'s first LP to crack the top 100 pop album chart since 1972\\'s 360 Degrees of Billy Paul, reaching #88. Paul also had his usual success on the Soul charts with the album hitting #27 and the singles \"How Good is Your Game,\" \"I Trust You,\" and \"Let \\'Em In\" reaching #50, #79, and #91 respectively. Paul\\'s version of the Elton John hit \"Your Song\" cracked the top 40 in the U.K reaching #38.\\n\\nFinal PIR recordings\\nPaul released Only the Strong Survive in 1977 and it proved to be his final charting album reaching #152 on the Pop chart and #36 Soul. The LP\\'s title track was the first single reaching #68 on the Soul chart and #33 in the UK. The next time Paul\\'s voice would be heard during the summer of 1977 was on the track \"Let\\'s Clean Up the Ghetto\" featuring the \"Philadelphia International All-Stars\": Billy Paul, Lou Rawls, Archie Bell, Teddy Pendergrass, Dee Dee Sharp Gamble, and Eddie Levert and Walter Williams of The O\\'Jays. The song reached #91 on the Pop chart and #4 on the Soul chart. The Let\\'s Clean Up the Ghetto album also included the Billy Paul tracks (both written by Gamble & Huff) \"New Day\" and \"New World Comin\\'.\" All proceeds from the album and single went toward a program to benefit inner-cities throughout the U.S. Paul followed up the success of both his \"Only the Strong Survive\" single and \"Let\\'s Clean Up the Ghetto\" with \"Sooner or Later\" - another track from his latest LP. Yet the track failed to chart as did \"Don\\'t Give Up on Us\" and \"Everybody\\'s Breaking Up\" which was officially released in the U.K. but only issued to radio in the U.S.\\n\\nPaul\\'s final studio album for Philadelphia International was First Class, issued in 1979. It was the first album since his 1968 debut Feelin\\' Good at the Cadillac Club that did not make either the Pop or Soul charts. The LP\\'s first single \"Bring the Family Back\" failed to chart but a 12\" disco version did reach #90 on the Soul chart and #51 on the Dance chart. \"False Faces\" was also released in both single and 12\" disco versions but neither charted.\\n\\nPaul\\'s run at Philadelphia International officially ended with the 1980 release Best of Billy Paul. This double-album compilation included four previously unreleased tracks: \"You\\'re My Sweetness,\" \"Next to Nature,\" \"What Are We Going to Do Now That He\\'s Back,\" and \"My Old Flame.\" The UK version was a single LP titled Billy Paul\\'s Greatest Hits with a different track listing and only one of the \"new\" songs: \"You\\'re My Sweetness\". That song was released as a single and reached #69 on the Soul chart. Paul\\'s final single for Philadelphia International was an edited version of a song from his first Philadelphia International album Going East: \"Jesus Boy (You Only Look Like a Man)\" which failed to chart.\\n\\nNumerous \"best of\" compilations of Paul\\'s Philadelphia International work have been released over the years, though critics have made plain that most have failed to capture the right balance of singles and album tracks to fully represent the depth and breadth of his PIR output. For example, AllMusic\\'s Andrew Hamilton said of the 2002 collection Super Hits: \"If you didn\\'t live and die with Billy Paul\\'s albums when he cranked them out on Philadelphia International Records, you won\\'t have a clue as to what his fans want to hear. To compile a CD from Paul\\'s singles is to compile a mediocre collection; you have to supplement the singles with choice LP cuts. And with a brief ten-track collection like this, some of the singles should have been replaced with a few of Paul\\'s icy album joints.\" By contrast, Jason Ankeny said that the 1999 compilation Me & Mrs. Jones: Best of Billy Paul \"goes far beyond the classic title track in restoring the singer to prominence, showcasing his versatility via superb covers of pop favorites.... and the inclusion of R&B chart hits.... it all adds up to a definitive portrait of Paul in his prime.\"\\n\\nPaul was on the Philadelphia International label, in all, for nine years and while he enjoyed considerable success - especially with \"Me and Mrs. Jones\" - critics generally agree that he deserved better. Andrew Hamilton put it bluntly: \"Gamble and Huff did a horrible job picking Paul\\'s singles. Some better choices, and his career might have been Hall-of-Famish.\" Similarly, Jason Ankeny wrote: \"Too easily dismissed as little more than a one-hit wonder, Billy Paul was, in fact, one of the most gifted and affecting talents to grace the Philadelphia International stable - the recipient of some of the Gamble and Huff team\\'s most lush and sophisticated productions. His deeply soulful voice bridged the gap between jazz and soul, textured in equal measure by street-smart swagger and touching vulnerability.\"\\n\\nPost-PIR studio recordings\\nPaul made two studio albums in the 1980s. The first Lately was released in 1985 and was a dramatic musical departure from the lush Philadelphia Soul of his previous efforts. Recorded for Lonnie Simmons\\' Total Experience Records, the album\\'s synthesizer and keyboard-driven tracks (typical of music production at the time) were closer to Simmons\\' work with The Gap Band and Yarbrough and Peoples than they were to Paul\\'s 70\\'s orchestrated wall of sound. The album\\'s title track, a ballad, was released as a single in the U.K. but did not chart. The follow-up single - a slow jam called \"Sexual Therapy\" - fared better climbing to #80 on the U.K. charts.\\n\\nPaul\\'s final studio album was 1988\\'s Wide Open for the Ichiban label. Similar in production style to his previous release, though perhaps a bit smoother, it reached #61 on the Soul chart. However, the singles \"We Could Have Been\" and \"I Just Love You So Much\" failed to chart.\\n\\n\"Retirement\" years\\nPaul announced his retirement in 1989 on stage in London. But like so many artists before him, he could not resist the temptation to continue to play live shows and record. In 2009 he was asked how he was enjoying his retirement in South Jersey: \"Retired? Are you serious?\"\\n\\n\\nBilly Paul has regularly played live around the world including this 2006 concert at the Carthage Palace Hotel in Tunis, Tunisia.\\nPost-\"retirement,\" Paul regularly toured in the U.S. and abroad playing small clubs, hotel ballrooms, Las Vegas showrooms, Jazz festivals, and theaters. For example, Paul has played Sweetwater\\'s on Amsterdam and 68th street in New York City; the Cape May Jazz Fest; the Almanaque Café in São Paulo, Brazil; and the Carthage Palace Hotel in Tunis, Tunisia.\\n\\nAsked in 2012 whether playing in Philadelphia held special meaning to him: \"I try to feel comfortable wherever I play, but they call it being a native son and I do get a lot of respect there so it is special. The reaction internationally is great as well, so even in Paris or Brazil we have great audiences. Songs like Mrs. Jones are huge everywhere so I do perform a lot overseas.\"\\n\\nIn 2000 he released a CD - Live World Tour 1999-2000 - on his own label, PhillySounds. Recorded in São Paulo, Brazil; Paris, France; Bermuda, and Philadelphia, it contained the following tracks: \"Billy\\'s Back Home,\" \"Love Buddies,\" \"When Love is New,\" \"This is Your Life,\" \"Thanks for Saving My Life,\" \"Let\\'s Get It On/What\\'s Going On,\" \"War of the Gods,\" \"I Believe I Can Fly,\" \"Your Song,\" \"Without You,\" and \"Mr & Mrs. Jones.\" Two years later, a complete show from that tour was released outside the U.S. on the PID label. Titled, Your Songs: Live in Paris,\" it was recorded in December 2000 at a private event for the RFM TV Channel at Studio 287 in Paris, France. It includes the songs \"July, July, July, July,\" \"Only the Strong Survive,\" \"It\\'s Too Late,\" \"Brown Baby,\" \"Let \\'Em In,\" \"It\\'s Critical,\" \"False Faces,\" and \"Let\\'s Clean Up the Ghetto\" among others.\\n\\n\"“I’ve always worked hard to create my own style. Nobody sounds like me. I’ve heard them call me ‘legendary.’ That feels pretty good … though the word is overused these days.” -Billy Paul, 2009\\n\\nAs these live albums illustrate, Paul\\'s concert set lists have been varied, containing both his own songs as well as cover versions of jazz, soul, rock, and pop tunes. For example, his 16 September 2001 Sunday afternoon show at Gloria\\'s Seafood in Philadelphia featured: \"Billy Boy,\" \"Billy\\'s Back Home,\" \"Just in Time,\" \"Old Folks,\" \"Sleeping Bee,\" \"Ebony Woman,\" \"Thanks for Saving My Life,\" \"Love Buddies,\" \"April in Paris/I Love Paris,\" and \"Me and Mrs. Jones.\"\\n\\nHis 12 June 2011 show in São Paulo, Brazil consisted of: \"Thanks for Saving My Life,\" \"I Will Survive\" (performed by backing vocalist Anna Jordan), \"Hello,\" \"Purple Rain,\" \"Smile,\" \"Mrs. Robinson,\" \"Your Song,\" \"Me and Mrs. Jones,\" and \"You Are So Beautiful.\"\\n\\n\"Me and Mrs. Jones\" lawsuits\\n\\nOlympic athlete Marion Jones was featured in the Nike television commercial that used Billy Paul\\'s \"Me and Mrs. Jones\" song without his consent.\\nIn 2000, Nike - the world\\'s biggest maker of athletic shoes - began airing a commercial featuring track and field star Marion Jones - the face of Team USA for the 2000 Summer Olympics. The campaign, entitled \"Mrs. Jones\", depicted the athlete as a half-hidden DJ talking about issues such as education and better pay for female athletes. The ad also featured Paul\\'s studio recording of \"Me and Mrs. Jones\". Paul saw the commercial and contacted an attorney who filed suit in a federal district court in Los Angeles against both the sportswear company and its advertising agency, Wieden & Kennedy. Paul sought $1 million in lost licensing fees, arguing that the company had not obtained his permission to use the song. A spokesperson for the ad agency called the decision to air the song without permission \"a very stupid mistake.\"\\n\\nOn the heels of the Nike suit, Paul targeted his former record company for unpaid royalties on his signature song. He claimed that he had not received an accounting statement from Philadelphia International Records in 27 years and sued Assorted Music, its owners Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, and Sony Music Entertainment for nearly half a million dollars. At the 2003 trial in a federal district court in Los Angeles, Joseph E. Porter, the attorney for Assorted Music, argued that Paul was only owed about $27,000, explaining that while the company had mistakenly failed to collect proper foreign royalties on the record, Paul actually owed the company about $314,000 for the costs of recording and producing the 10 albums he made for Philadelphia International from 1971–80.\\n\\nIn the end, the jury deliberated for less than an hour and found that Paul did not owe the company anything. Instead, they awarded him half a million dollars in unpaid royalties for his recording of \"Me and Mrs. Jones.\" Paul said through a statement issued by his attorney: \"I\\'m so glad my path to justice has finally come to an end. I\\'ve been waiting years to be paid for my recordings.\" Seymour Straus, who testified at trial on Paul\\'s behalf commented: \"There is no question that Billy Paul\\'s royalties had been improperly calculated for many years.\" Jay Berger of the Artists Rights Enforcement Corporation said: \"This case firmly establishes the rights of singers signed to small production companies to receive 50% of the money earned by the major labels that distribute the records.\" Chuck Rubin the president of Artists Rights said: \"The producers will no longer walk off with any of the artist\\'s royalties.\" Paul\\'s lawyer Steven Ames Brown commented: \"It was a stunning victory for Billy. The jury awarded him $12,000 more than we requested. The years of deception and excuses are over and Billy Paul will from now on enjoy the fruits of his talents. Los Angeles juries have no patience for deadbeat record companies.\" Brown added: \"And Billy Paul was Kenny Gamble\\'s best friend. Can you imagine what might have happened to the others?\"\\n\\n\\nThe O\\'Jays were among the artists who benefited from the precedent set by Billy Paul\\'s lawsuit for unpaid royalties.\\nPaul\\'s wife and manager Blanche Williams called the decision a \"moral victory\" and had especially harsh words for Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff: \"The jury was...pissed off at the arrogance of G&H, the \\'creative bookkeeping\\' done by Sony, and at discovering how blatantly and systematically Sony and PIR under-reported Billy\\'s earnings.... In addition G&H will have to pay us interest on that money going back to \\'94 (statute of limitations). Oh yes, \\'the chickens came home to roost.\\' Winning this case opens the door for all of those other artists whose royalties were withheld or under-accounted to go to court and seek justice, and to know that they have a good chance of winning their case. This is just the beginning of G&H\\'s worst nightmare. The avalanche cometh.\"\\n\\nGamble & Huff\\'s attorney Porter said after the verdict: \"It was nothing but an accounting (issue). No one said \\'you cheated me.\\'\" Still, Paul\\'s case was an important precedent for other artists including Archie Bell of Archie Bell & the Drells and the The O\\'Jays who also sued Gamble & Huff for unpaid royalties.\\n\\nFeature film\\nIn 2009, the biographical feature film Am I Black Enough for You?, directed by Swedish director Göran Hugo Olsson was released. Awarding the film three stars, Uncut magazine said \"Olsson modelled his film on Let’s Get Lost, Bruce Weber’s 1989 portrait of Chet Baker, saying: \"Paul is certainly no fallen demi-genius to set alongside Baker, but he proves an engaging, articulate subject, with a story that stretches back to playing alongside Charlie Parker, and peppered with the usual racial prejudice. His career is, in its way, emblematic of black America’s struggles over the last half century, including a descent into cocaine addiction and recovery, both shared with his wife, who remains a quirky, willful presence throughout the movie. The pair come across as a jazzy Derby and Joan.\"\\n\\nPaul explained why he agreed to work with the filmmakers: \"Well I\\'m not getting any younger and I wanted to express some things that might have been hidden. I wanted to release my heart and tell people about my highs and lows and I think you get that from this documentary.... It wasn\\'t difficult to make. We were followed all over the world by this film crew from Europe and I got to be very good friends with the filmmakers. I would say things and do things as if the camera wasn\\'t even there. They approached me about doing this film, and they are real fans. \"Am I Black Enough for You?\" is very popular in Sweden and these guys really knew their music. They were serious about it, they flew over and followed me and it got real personal...and I trusted them. It\\'s very important like the relationship I have with my wife is based on trust. I wish everyone could have that level in their lives.... I am now at peace with myself, I think this movie has done a lot for me because it\\'s helped me get rid of a lot of demons.\\n\\nRecent activity\\nIn 2011, Paul participated in an album by French singer Chimène Badi, recording a duet with her on the Motown song, \"Ain\\'t No Mountain High Enough\".\\n\\nTo mark the 40th anniversary of Philadelphia International Records, in 2011 Big Break Records in the UK began remastering and reissuing many of the albums released on PIR including Paul\\'s works. They included new liner notes, interviews, and bonus tracks. In the U.S., Legacy Recordings issued Golden Gate Groove: The Sound of Philadelphia Live in San Francisco 1973 - a record company event recorded on 27 June 1973 at the Fairmont Hotel. Paul and other PIR acts were backed by MFSB which featured 35 musicians including Leon Huff on organ. Paul\\'s performances of \"East\" (10:21) and \"Me and Mrs. Jones\" (8:34) appear on the album. AllMusic\\'s Andy Kellman gave the release 4.5 out of 5 stars.\\n\\nAwards and honors\\nIn addition to receiving the Grammy for \"Me and Mrs. Jones\", Paul won several Ebby awards given by the readers of Ebony magazine; was a recipient of an American Music Award, the NAACP Image Award and numerous proclamations and keys to cities across the United States. Paul received the 2015 AMG Favorite Retro Artist of the Year award as well as being given the Sandy Hosey Lifetime Achievement Award during the Artists Music Guild\\'s 2015 AMG Heritage Awards broadcast held on November 14, 2015, in Monroe, North Carolina.\\n\\nPaul died on the afternoon of April 24, 2016 at his home in Blackwood, New Jersey from pancreatic cancer at the age of 81.\\n\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Paul\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Billy Preston (9 September 1946 - 6 June 2006) was an American soul and rock singer, famously known as a child prodigy pianist before releasing several rnb hits (including #1 smashes \"Will It Go \\'Round in Circles\" and \"Nothing From Nothing\") and working with classic artists such as Aretha Franklin and The Beatles. He notably performed with Mahalia Jackson at the age of 16 and appeared as a young W.C. Handy in a 1958 biopic. His first solo record was a gospel album called \\'16 Year Old Soul\\'.\\n\\nPreston first came to widespread attention of a U.S. mainstream audience as the organist (and sometimes vocalist) in the house band on the television show \\'Shindig,\\' popular during 1964-66. On tour backing stars Little Richard and Sam Cooke, he met the Beatles (early in their career) in Hamburg, Germany in 1962. He was later invited by George Harrison to join The Beatles in the studio for the filming/recording of \\'Let It Be\\' (1970). Preston\\'s most memorable performance with the Beatles is on the track \"Get Back\". \\n\\nThe apparent reason for the collaboration was that the project was being done live— without overdubs— and the Beatles wanted a second keyboardist. Preston\\'s soulful style was to compliment the rhythm and blues approach the Beatles had for this album. His was a genre they\\'d grown up listening to and were reaching back to as well as paying tribute to.\\n\\nAnother apparent reason for Preston\\'s involvement was to buffer the growing tensions between the members of the band (that had started around the time of filming). Everyone set aside their differences to make Preston feel welcome at the sessions. Members of the band have later commented on their joy with working with Preston, whom they respected as a talented musician.\\n\\nWhile Preston was never considered for permanent membership in the Beatles (despite stories to the contrary), he did continue working with them through to the end of the 60s: releasing two solo albums on Apple Records (the Beatles\\' label), collaborating with George Harrison on \\'All Things Must Pass\\', and joining in on the Concert for Bangladesh— one of the first significant benefit concerts of its kind (at Madison Square Garden in 1972). Preston also later made an appearance in the infamous Beatles tribute film \\'Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band\\' (1978), as the title character— Sgt. Pepper. He\\'s sometimes been referred to as a \\'Fifth Beatle\\'.\\n\\nIn addition to work with said group, Preston also played and toured with The Rolling Stones, playing on significant albums such as \\'Sticky Fingers\\' and \\'Exile on Main St.\\' In the 70s, Preston also worked with Bob Dylan, playing as an accompanist on \\' Blood on the Tracks\\', and Aretha Franklin, on her record \\'Young, Gifted and Black\\'. As the years went on, Preston collaborated with numerous other artists including Barbra Streisand and Miles Davis, also notable touring with Sly and the Family Stone for a time. He also played organ with the Ray Charles big band on tour in the late 60s.  \\n\\nIn terms of his solo career, Preston\\'s hit tracks \"Will It Go \\'Round in Circles\" and \"Nothing From Nothing\" both reached all the way to number one in the U.S. and still remain staples of oldies stations. He won a Grammy Award for best pop instrumental performance for \"Outa Space\" in 1971, and he received an invitation to the White House no less in 1974. Though perhaps overshadowed by his collaborative work, he devolved a strong and devoted fan-base as album after album made it into the Billboard top 200 album chart.\\n\\nPreston was also the music director and band leader for the Garry Shandling show in the 80s, returning to the TV work that had given him his start. Yet, in the 80s and 90s, Preston sadly suffered substance abuse and financial issues. He spent three years in prison in 1997 for a drugs possession charge handed out earlier that year (cocaine possession and assault). \\n\\nHis last recordings were on the Red Hot Chili Peppers\\' album \\'Stadium Arcadium\\' and with Neil Diamond for his \"12 songs\" record, both produced by Rick Rubin. \\n\\nA U.S. musical legend, Preston passed away at the age of 59 in a hospital in Scottsdale, Arizona, as a result of \"malignant hypertension that resulted in kidney failure and other complications\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Preston\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Squier left the music industry in the mid-90s, due in part to issues with his label as well as changing musical trends.\\n\\nHe has been active in the 00s and since, touring both as a single artist and as a member of the rotating supergroup \\'Ringo Starr & His All Starr Band\\'. Before fronting the band titled in his name, Squire was the frontman of the power pop group Piper. Said band had some underground fame in the 70s before Squire left for bigger things.\\n\\nSquier started off his solo career with May 1980\\'s \\'The Tale of the Tape\\'. Although a commercial breakthrough eluded him, the release spent three months on Billboard\\'s album chart and gained a large fan response. Working with songwriter impresario Desmond Child and Kiss co-guitarist Bruce Kulick, his album also brought him praising critical reviews, noting his talent for meeting catchy pop hooks with aggressive guitars and vocals.\\n\\nHis 1981 follow-up, \\'Don\\'t Say No\\', shot his career into the stratosphere. It hit the Top Five on the Billboard album chart and remained on the chart for over two years (a total of 111 weeks). Getting RIAA certified as triple-platinum, singles such as \"Lonely Is The Night\" and \"The Stroke\" became staples of arena rock radio. His music from this album has popped up in variety of places such as in the comedy film \\'Blades of Glory\\' and in the popular Guitar Hero video game series.\\n\\nSquier\\'s third album, \\'Emotions in Motion\\', also picked up both critical praise, with Allmusic calling it a \"slice of AOR heaven\", and commercial acclaim. The album itself peaked at #5 on the Billboard 200 chart while singles such as \"Everybody Wants You\" and  \"Learn How To Live\" achieved top 40 rock stardom. Squier also achieved notability both for his album cover, devised by famous artist Andy Warhol, and for his popular music videos, played often on MTV.\\n\\nMassively successful touring with artists such as Queen had Squier labeled as one of the best hard rock artists of the decade. Still, \\'what goes up, must come down\\', as the saying goes, and his next album would spell his downfall. 1984\\'s \\'Signs of Life\\' came out with initial good press, viewed as perhaps lacking the rock crunch of his previous affairs but still involving some catchy tunes. Single \"Rock Me Tonite\", released in June 1984 as the lead single, became his highest charting U.S. song, peaking at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 and hitting the Top 10 on the Cash Box singles chart. It also returned him to #1 on the Top Rock Tracks chart in August of 1984.\\n\\nNevertheless, the music video for the song was the beginning of the end for this part of Squier\\'s career. Popularly regarded as one of the worst ever music videos ever made, if not the worst, it shows Squier putting on a pink tank top and making effeminate dance moves around a bed with pastel-colored satin sheets while badly miming to the song, rolling around on the floor in several parts. Many viewers who saw it thought that it depicted the singer on drugs or pretending to be flamboyantly gay. It was directed by Kenny Ortega, who was the third director to be considered for the job.\\n\\nAfter an acrimonious break from his label and also making other changes, Squier re-grouped and released \\'Enough Is Enough\\' on September 27, 1986. Signed to Capitol Records, he achieved some success, with the album having peaked at #61 on the Billboard album chart, but failed to meet expectations. Some critics charged that the stress that he had been put under took its toll on his songwriting. Future releases over the next few years failed to change things as his popularity slid downwards, and he ultimately quit the music industry for several years in the 90s.\\n\\nAs stated before, he has been active in the 00s and since, touring both as a single artist and as a member of the rotating supergroup \\'Ringo Starr & His All Starr Band\\'. More recently, a few live albums have come out featuring his music. He also has had several low-key tours. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Squier\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Billy Stewart (March 24, 1937 – January 17, 1970) was an American musical artist, with a highly distinctive scat-singing style, who enjoyed popularity in the early 1960s.\\n\\nBilly Stewart began singing publicly with his mother\\'s group, the Stewart Gospel Singers, as a teenager. He made the transition to secular music by filling in occasionally for the Rainbows, a D.C. area vocal group led by future soul star Don Covay. It was also through the Rainbows that Stewart met another aspiring singer, a very young Marvin Gaye. Seminal rock and roller Bo Diddley has been credited with discovering Stewart playing piano in Washington, D.C. in 1956 and inviting him to be one of his backup musicians. This led to a recording contract with Bo Diddley\\'s label, Chess Records, and Bo Diddley played guitar on Stewart\\'s 1956 recording of \"Billy\\'s Blues\". Stewart then moved to Okeh Records and recorded \"Billy\\'s Heartache\" backed by the Marquees, another D.C. area group which was now featuring Marvin Gaye.\\n\\nBack at Chess in the early 1960s, Stewart began working with A&R man Billy Davis. He cut a song called \"Fat Boy\". Showing additional promise with his recordings of \"Reap What You Sow\" and \"Strange Feeling\", major chart success was not far away. Stewart hit both the pop and R&B charts big in 1965 with the songs, “I Do Love You” and “Sitting in the Park.” His improvisational technique of doubling-up, scatting his words and trilling his lips made his style unique in the 1960s.\\n\\nIn 1966, wishing to appeal to a wider audience, Stewart recorded the LP \"Billy Stewart Teaches Old Standards New Tricks\" in 1966. The first single released from that album was Billy\\'s radical stand-out interpretation of the George Gershwin classic \"Summertime\", a top ten hit on both the pop and R&B charts in 1966. The follow-up single was Billy\\'s remake of the Doris Day hit \"Secret Love\", which just missed the top ten on the R&B chart.\\n\\nWhile Stewart continued to record throughout the remainder of the 1960s, his weight problem worsened and he developed diabetes. He also suffered minor injuries in a motorcycle accident in 1969. His life was tragically cut short on January 17, 1970, just 2 months prior to his 33rd birthday, when the car he was driving plunged into the Neuse River in North Carolina, killing him and three members of his band.\\n\\nBilly Stewart was inducted into the Washington Area Music Association Hall of Fame in 1982. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Stewart\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He went by the names Billy Jones and Billy Fortune as well. The quartet itself also went by several different names: The Sabers (original name), The Chavelles, The Gents, The Valiants, The Untouchables, The Electras, The Freedoms, The Alley Cats and Africa. Others in the group included at one time or another original members Herbie (last name unknown), Sheridan \"Rip\" Spencer, Rip\\'s cousin Brice Coefield, and Walter Carter, and others (Chester Pipkin). Billy sang lead on such songs \"This Is the Night\" (#43 on the R&B chart; #69 on the Pop chart) and the flip tune \"Good Golly Miss Molly\". Little Richard had recorded the song earlier but the Valiants\\' version was actually released first in November of 1957.\\n\\nHe was heavily influenced by Clyde McPhatter and Little Richard.\\n\\nBilly left The Valiants in 1958 and teamed up with the remnants of the group Vita Squires, recording the songs \"Every Word of the song\" and \"Listen to Your Heart\" for Hite Morgan and his wife Dorinda. This 1958 pairing was released on the Morgans\\' Dice label as by Billy Fortune and the Squires and on their Deck label as by Billy Storm and the Squires.

Mitch Miller handled the session, in which a vocal group chorus was used.\\n\\nIn 1960 and 1961 Billy had two sessions for Atlantic records (produced by Phil Spector) which resulted in three singles. Most of the songs were old R&B standards: \"Dear One,\" \"When You Dance,\" \"A Kiss from Your Lips\" and \"Honey Love\", plus one pop standard \"In the Chapel in the Moonlight\" but none of these songs charted.\\n\\nReturned to the The Valiants/The Untouchables group now and then to record such songs as \"Goodnight, Sweetheart, Goodnight\" and \"You Lied\".\\n\\nAt one point in the early 60s Billy was on the Disney Studios\\' Buena Vista label. While recording for Disney, he also did some character voices in Disney cartoons.\\n\\nFinally, in late 1968, Billy became part of the last incarnation of The Sabers/The Valiants/The Untouchables was the soul group Africa, recording for Lou Adler\\'s Ode label.\\n\"Here I Stand\" was written by Billy and he does part of the lead on it. Five years later, Africa recorded ten more tracks for MGM, but all remain unreleased.\\n\\n\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Storm\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'There are at least five artists with this name;\\n\\n1) John Towner Williams (born February 8, 1932) is an American composer, conductor, and pianist. With a career spanning over six decades, he has composed some of the most popular, recognizable, and critically acclaimed film scores in cinematic history, including those of the Star Wars series, Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Superman, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, the Indiana Jones series, the first two Home Alone films, Hook, the first two Jurassic Park films, Schindler\\'s List, and the first three Harry Potter films. \\n\\nWilliams has been associated with director Steven Spielberg since 1974, composing music for all but three of his feature films. Other works by Williams include theme music for the 1984 Summer Olympic Games, NBC Sunday Night Football, \"The Mission\" theme used by NBC News and Seven News in Australia, the television series Lost in Space and Land of the Giants, and the incidental music for the first season of Gilligan\\'s Island. Williams has also composed numerous classical concertos and other works for orchestral ensembles and solo instruments. He served as the Boston Pops\\'s principal conductor from 1980 to 1993, and is currently the orchestra\\'s laureate conductor.\\n\\nWilliams has won 24 Grammy Awards, seven British Academy Film Awards, five Academy Awards, and four Golden Globe Awards. With 51 Academy Award nominations, Williams is the second most-nominated individual, after Walt Disney. In 2005, the American Film Institute selected Williams\\'s score to 1977\\'s Star Wars as the greatest American film score of all time. The soundtrack to Star Wars was additionally preserved by the Library of Congress into the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Williams was inducted into the Hollywood Bowl\\'s Hall of Fame in 2000, and was a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors in 2004 and the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2016. Williams composed the score for eight of the top 20 highest-grossing films at the U.S. box office (adjusted for inflation).\\n\\nJohn Towner Williams was born on February 8, 1932 in Floral Park, New York, to Esther (née Towner) and Johnny Williams, a jazz percussionist who played with the Raymond Scott Quintet. Williams has said of his lineage, \"My father was a Maine man—we were very close. My mother was from Boston. My father\\'s parents ran a department store in Bangor, Maine, and my mother\\'s father was a cabinetmaker. [...] People with those roots are not inclined to be lazy.\"\\n\\nWilliams married Barbara Ruick, an American actress and singer, in 1956. Together they had three children: Jennifer (b. 1956), Mark Towner Williams (b. 1958), and Joseph (b. 1960), who is the lead singer of Toto. The two remained married until her death in 1974. In 1980, Williams married Samantha Winslow, a photographer.\\n\\n2) John Christopher Williams is a classical guitar player.\\n\\nBorn in Melbourne, Australia, on 24 April 1941, to an English father (Len Williams) and an Australian-Chinese mother, Williams was taught initially by his father. At the age of twelve he went to Italy to study under \"The Maestro,\" Andrés Segovia. Later, he attended the Royal College of Music in London, studying piano because the school did not have a guitar department at the time. Upon graduation, he was offered the opportunity to create such a department. He seized the opportunity and ran it for the first two years. Williams has maintained links with the College (and with the Northern College in Manchester) ever since.\\n\\nWilliams is best known as a classical guitarist, but has explored many different musical traditions. He has collaborated with Julian Bream and Paco Peña and was a member of the fusion group Sky. He is also a composer and arranger.\\n\\nWilliams has commissioned guitar concertos from composers such as Stephen Dodgson, André Previn, Patrick Gowers, Richard Harvey, and Steve Gray. He has also worked with composers from his native Australia, including Phillip Houghton, Peter Sculthorpe, Ross Edwards (composer), and Nigel Westlake, to produce guitar works that capture the spirit of his homeland.\\n\\nHe enjoyed a worldwide hit single with his recording of Cavatina by Stanley Myers, used as the theme tune to the Oscar-winning film The Deer Hunter (1979). The piece had originally been written for piano, for another film ten years earlier, The Walking Stick (1970) but re-written for guitar and expanded by Myers at Williams\\' invitation. In 1973, Cleo Laine wrote lyrics and recorded the song \"He Was Beautiful\" accompanied by John Williams. A year later, it was a top-five UK hit single for Iris Williams (no relation).\\n\\nAt the invitation of producer Martin Lewis he created a highly acclaimed classical-rock fusion duet with celebrated rock guitarist Pete Townshend of Townshend\\'s anthemic \"Won\\'t Get Fooled Again\" for the 1979 Amnesty International benefit show The Secret Policeman\\'s Ball. The duet was featured on the resulting album and the film version of the show – bringing Williams to the broader attention of the rock audience.\\n\\nThe relationship with Lewis led to Williams\\' classical-rock fusion band Sky being invited to give the first-ever rock concert to be held at Westminster Abbey – a benefit concert for Amnesty that Lewis produced in February 1981.\\n\\nHe is visiting professor at the Royal Academy of Music, London.\\n\\nWilliams and his artist wife Kathy Panama reside in London and Australia.\\n\\n3) John Williams \\n\\nJohn Williams is internationally regarded as one of the foremost players of Irish music today. With five All-Ireland titles to his credit, John is the only American-born competitor ever to win first place in the \"senior concertina\" category. His additional talents on flute, button accordion, bodhran, and piano distinguish him as a much sought after multi-instrumentalist in the acoustic scene around the world.\\n\\nBorn and raised on the Southwest Side of Chicago, John spent his summers during college on the Southwest coast of Ireland in his father’s village of Doolin, Co. Clare. Like Chicago, Doolin became a major musical crossroads for John and countless other local and international musicians to meet and exchange music. Gigging every night in the pubs of Doolin and Lisdoonvarna soon led to performances in Galway, Cork, Dublin, Belfast, Paris, Britanny, Zurich, and New York City (bio http://www.johnwilliamsmusic.com/bio.htm).\\n\\n 3) John Williams \\n\\nA blues/jazz guitarist in Seattle, Washington, whose music is available at Magnatune.com (bio http://magnatune.com/artists/john_williams).\\n\\n 3) John Knowles Williams \\n\\nAn experimental/indie musician.

       " 'Harry Lillis \"Bing\" Crosby Jr. (/ˈkrɒzbi/; May 3, 1903 – October 14, 1977) was an American singer, comedian and actor. The first multimedia star, Crosby was a leader in record sales, radio ratings, and motion picture grosses from 1931 to 1954. His early career coincided with recording innovations that allowed him to develop an intimate singing style that influenced many male singers who followed him, including Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, Dick Haymes, and Dean Martin. Yank magazine said that he was \"the person who had done the most for the morale of overseas servicemen\" during World War II. In 1948, American polls declared him the \"most admired man alive\", ahead of Jackie Robinson and Pope Pius XII. Also in 1948, Music Digest estimated that his recordings filled more than half of the 80,000 weekly hours allocated to recorded radio music.\\n\\nCrosby won an Oscar for Best Actor for his role as Father Chuck O\\'Malley in the 1944 motion picture Going My Way and was nominated for his reprise of the role in The Bells of St. Mary\\'s opposite Ingrid Bergman the next year, becoming the first of six actors to be nominated twice for playing the same character. In 1963, Crosby received the first Grammy Global Achievement Award. He is one of 33 people to have three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, in the categories of motion pictures, radio, and audio recording. He was also known for his collaborations with longtime friend Bob Hope, starring in the Road to... film from 1940 to 1962.\\n\\nCrosby influenced the development of the postwar recording industry. After seeing a demonstration of a German broadcast quality reel-to-reel tape recorder brought to America by John T. Mullin, he invested $50,000 in a California electronics company called Ampex to build copies. He then convinced ABC to allow him to tape his shows. He became the first performer to pre-record his radio shows and master his commercial recordings onto magnetic tape. Through the medium of recording, he constructed his radio programs with the same directorial tools and craftsmanship (editing, retaking, rehearsal, time shifting) used in motion picture production, a practice that became an industry standard. In addition to his work with early audio tape recording, he helped to finance the development of videotape, bought television stations, bred racehorses, and co-owned the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team.\\n\\nEarly life:\\nCrosby was born on May 3, 1903 in Tacoma, Washington, in a house his father built at 1112 North J Street. In 1906, his family moved to Spokane in eastern Washington State, where he was raised. In 1913, his father built a house at 508 E. Sharp Avenue. The house sits on the campus of his alma mater, Gonzaga University. It functions today as museum housing over 200 artifacts from his life and career, including his Oscar.\\n\\nHe was the fourth of seven children: brothers Laurence Earl (Larry) (1895–1975), Everett Nathaniel (1896–1966), Edward John (Ted) (1900–1973), and George Robert (Bob) (1913–1993); and two sisters, Catherine Cordelia (1904–1974) and Mary Rose (1906–1990). His parents were Harry Lowe Crosby (1870–1950), a bookkeeper, and Catherine Helen \"Kate\" (née Harrigan; 1873–1964). His mother was a second generation Irish-American. His father was of Scottish and English descent; an ancestor, Simon Crosby, emigrated from Scotland to New England in the 1630s during the Puritan migration to New England. Through another line, also on his father\\'s side, Crosby is descended from Mayflower passenger William Brewster (c. 1567 – April 10, 1644). On November 8, 1937, after Lux Radio Theatre\\'s adaptation of She Loves Me Not, Joan Blondell asked Crosby how he got his nickname:\\n\\nCrosby: \"Well, I\\'ll tell you, back in the knee-britches day, when I was a wee little tyke, a mere broth of a lad, as we say in Spokane, I used to totter around the streets, with a gun on each hip, my favorite after school pastime was a game known as \"Cops and Robbers\", I didn\\'t care which side I was on, when a cop or robber came into view, I would haul out my trusty six-shooters, made of wood, and loudly exclaim bing! bing!, as my luckless victim fell clutching his side, I would shout bing! bing!, and I would let him have it again, and then as his friends came to his rescue, shooting as they came, I would shout bing! bing! bing! bing! bing! bing! bing! bing!\"\\nBlondell: \"I\\'m surprised they didn\\'t call you \"Killer\" Crosby! Now tell me another story, Grandpa!\\nCrosby: \"No, so help me, it\\'s the truth, ask Mister De Mille.\"\\nDe Mille: \"I\\'ll vouch for it, Bing.\"\\n\\nThat story was pure whimsy for dramatic effect and the truth is that a neighbor – Valentine Hobart – named him \"Bingo from Bingville\" after a comic feature in the local paper called \"The Bingville Bugle\" which the young Harry liked. In time, Bingo got shortened to Bing.\\n\\nIn 1917, Crosby took a summer job as property boy at Spokane\\'s \"Auditorium,\" where he witnessed some of the finest acts of the day, including Al Jolson, who held him spellbound with ad libbing and parodies of Hawaiian songs. He later described Jolson\\'s delivery as \"electric.\"\\n\\nCrosby graduated from Gonzaga High School (today\\'s Gonzaga Prep) in 1920 and enrolled at Gonzaga University. He attended Gonzaga for three years but did not earn a degree. As a freshman, he played on the university\\'s baseball team. The university granted him an honorary doctorate in 1937. Today, Gonzaga University houses a large collection of photographs, correspondence, and other material related to Crosby.\\n\\nPerformance career — early years:\\nIn 1923, Crosby was invited to join a new band composed of high-school students a few years younger than himself. Al Rinker, Miles Rinker, James Heaton, Claire Pritchard and Robert Pritchard, along with drummer Crosby, formed the Musicaladers, who performed at dances both for high-school students and for club-goers. The group performed on Spokane radio station KHQ, but disbanded after two years. 92–97 Crosby and Al Rinker then obtained work at the Clemmer Theatre in Spokane (now known as the Bing Crosby Theater). Crosby was initially a member of a vocal trio called \\'The Three Harmony Aces\\' with Al Rinker accompanying on piano from the pit, to entertain between the films. Bing and Al continued at the Clemmer Theatre for several months often with three other men – Wee Georgie Crittenden, Frank McBride and Lloyd Grinnell – and they were billed The Clemmer Trio or The Clemmer Entertainers depending who performed.\\n\\nIn October 1925, Crosby and his partner Al Rinker, brother of singer Mildred Bailey, decided to seek fame in California. They traveled to Los Angeles where they met Bailey. She introduced them to her show business contacts. The Fanchon and Marco Time Agency hired them for thirteen weeks for the revue The Syncopation Idea starting at the Boulevard Theater in Los Angeles and then on the Loew\\'s circuit. They each earned $75 a week. As minor parts of The Syncopation Idea Crosby and Rinker started to develop as entertainers. They had a lively style that was popular with college students. After The Syncopation Idea closed, they worked in the Will Morrissey Music Hall Revue. They honed their skills with Morrissey. When they got a chance to present an independent act, they were spotted by the Paul Whiteman organization. Whiteman needed something different to break up his musical selections, and Crosby and Rinker filled this requirement. After less than a year in show business, they were attached to one of the biggest names. Hired for $150 a week in 1926, they debuted with Whiteman on December 6 at the Tivoli Theatre in Chicago. Their first recording, in October 1926, was \"I\\'ve Got the Girl\" with Don Clark\\'s Orchestra, but the Columbia-issued record was inadvertently recorded at a slow speed, which increased the singers\\' pitch when played at 78 rpm. Throughout his career, Crosby often credited Bailey for getting him his first important job in the entertainment business.\\n\\nThe Rhythm Boys:\\nSuccess with Whiteman was followed by disaster when they reached New York. Whiteman considered letting them go. However, the addition of pianist and aspiring songwriter Harry Barris made the difference, and \"The Rhythm Boys\" were born. The additional voice meant they could be heard more easily in large New York theaters. Crosby gained valuable experience on tour for a year with Whiteman and performing and recording with Bix Beiderbecke, Jack Teagarden, Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Eddie Lang, and Hoagy Carmichael. He matured as a performer and was in demand as a solo singer.\\n\\nCrosby became the star attraction of the Rhythm Boys. In 1928, he had his first number one hit, a jazz-influenced rendition of \"Ol\\' Man River\". In 1929, the Rhythm Boys appeared in the film King of Jazz with Whiteman, but Crosby\\'s growing dissatisfaction with Whiteman led to the Rhythm Boys leaving his organization. They joined the Gus Arnheim Orchestra, performing nightly in the Cocoanut Grove of the Ambassador Hotel. Singing with the Arnheim Orchestra, Crosby\\'s solos began to steal the show while the Rhythm Boys act gradually became redundant. Harry Barris wrote several of Crosby\\'s hits, including \"At Your Command\", \"I Surrender Dear\", and \"Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams\". When Mack Sennett signed Crosby to a solo recording contract in 1931, a break with the Rhythm Boys became almost inevitable. Crosby married Dixie Lee in September 1930. After a threat of divorce in March 1931, he applied himself to his career.\\n\\nSuccess as a solo singer:\\n\\nOn September 2, 1931, Crosby made his nationwide solo radio debut. Before the end of the year, he signed with both Brunswick and CBS Radio. Doing a weekly 15-minute radio broadcast, Crosby became a hit. \"Out of Nowhere\", \"Just One More Chance\", \"At Your Command\" and \"I Found a Million Dollar Baby (in a Five and Ten Cent Store)\" were among the best selling songs of 1931.\\n\\nTen of the top 50 songs of 1931 included Crosby with others or as a solo act. A \"Battle of the Baritones\" with singer Russ Columbo proved short-lived, replaced with the slogan \"Bing Was King\". Crosby played the lead in a series of musical comedy short films for Mack Sennett, signed with Paramount, and starred in his first full-length film 1932\\'s The Big Broadcast (1932), the first of 55 films in which he received top billing. He would appear in 79 pictures. He signed a contract with Jack Kapp\\'s new record company, Decca, in late 1934.\\n\\nHis first commercial sponsor on radio was Cremo Cigars and his fame spread nationwide. After a long run in New York, he went back to Hollywood to film The Big Broadcast. His appearances, records, and radio work substantially increased his impact. The success of his first film brought him a contract with Paramount, and he began a pattern of making three films a year. He led his radio show for Woodbury Soap for two seasons while his live appearances dwindled. His records produced hits during the Depression when sales were down. Audio engineer Steve Hoffman stated, \"By the way, Bing actually saved the record business in 1934 when he agreed to support Decca founder Jack Kapp\\'s crazy idea of lowering the price of singles from a dollar to 35 cents and getting a royalty for records sold instead of a flat fee. Bing\\'s name and his artistry saved the recording industry. All the other artists signed to Decca after Bing did. Without him, Jack Kapp wouldn\\'t have had a chance in hell of making Decca work and the Great Depression would have wiped out phonograph records for good.\"\\n\\nHis social life was frantic. His first son Gary was born in 1933 with twin boys following in 1934. By 1936, he replaced his former boss, Paul Whiteman, as host of the weekly NBC radio program Kraft Music Hall, where he remained for the next ten years. \"Where the Blue of the Night (Meets the Gold of the Day)\", with his trademark whistling, became his theme song and signature tune.\\n\\nCrosby\\'s vocal style helped take popular singing beyond the \"belting\" associated with Al Jolson and Billy Murray, who had been obligated to reach the back seats in New York theaters without the aid of the microphone. As music critic, Henry Pleasants noted in The Great American Popular Singers, something new had entered American music, a style that might be called \"singing in American\" with conversational ease. This new sound led to the popular epithet \"crooner\".\\n\\nCrosby admired Louis Armstrong for his musical ability, and the trumpet maestro was a formative influence on Crosby\\'s singing style. When the two met, they immediately became friends. In 1936, Crosby exercised an option in his Paramount contract to regularly star in an out-of-house film. Signing an agreement with Columbia for a single motion picture, Crosby wanted Armstrong to appear in a screen adaptation of The Peacock Feather that eventually became Pennies from Heaven. Crosby asked Harry Cohn, but Cohn had no desire to pay for the flight or to meet Armstrong\\'s \"crude, mob-linked but devoted manager, Joe Glaser.\" Crosby threatened to leave the film and refused to discuss the matter. Cohn gave in; Armstrong\\'s musical scenes and comic dialogue extended his influence to the silver screen, creating more opportunities for him and other African Americans to appear in future films. Crosby also ensured behind the scenes that Armstrong received equal billing with his white co-stars. Armstrong appreciated Crosby\\'s progressive attitudes on race, and often expressed gratitude for the role in later years.\\n\\nDuring the Second World War, Crosby made live appearances before American troops who had been fighting in the European Theater. He learned how to pronounce German from written scripts and read propaganda broadcasts intended for German forces. The nickname \"Der Bingle\" was common among Crosby\\'s German listeners and came to be used by his English-speaking fans. In a poll of U.S. troops at the close of World War II, Crosby topped the list as the person who had done the most for G.I. morale, ahead of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, General Dwight Eisenhower, and Bob Hope.\\n\\nThe June 18, 1945, issue of Life magazine stated, \"America\\'s number one star, Bing Crosby, has won more fans, made more money than any entertainer in history. Today he is a kind of national institution.\" \"In all, 60,000,000 Crosby discs have been marketed since he made his first record in 1931. His biggest best seller is \\'White Christmas\\', 2,000,000 impressions of which have been sold in the U.S. and 250,000 in Great Britain.\" \"Nine out of ten singers and bandleaders listen to Crosby\\'s broadcasts each Thursday night and follow his lead. The day after he sings a song over the air – any song – some 50,000 copies of it are sold throughout the U.S. Time and again Crosby has taken some new or unknown ballad, has given it what is known in trade circles as the \\'big goose\\' and made it a hit single-handed and overnight...Precisely what the future holds for Crosby neither his family nor his friends can conjecture. \\n\\nHe has achieved greater popularity, made more money, attracted vaster audiences than any other entertainer in history has. And his star is still in the ascendant. His contract with Decca runs until 1955. His contract with Paramount runs until 1954. Records, which he made ten years ago, are selling better than ever before. The nation\\'s appetite for Crosby\\'s voice and personality appears insatiable. To soldiers overseas and to foreigners he has become a kind of symbol of America, of the amiable, humorous citizen of a free land. Crosby, however, seldom bothers to contemplate his future. For one thing, he enjoys hearing himself sing, and if ever a day should dawn when the public wearies of him, he will complacently go right on singing — to himself.\"\\n\\n\"White Christmas.\"\\nThe biggest hit song of Crosby\\'s career was his recording of Irving Berlin\\'s \"White Christmas\", which he introduced on a Christmas Day radio broadcast in 1941. (A copy of the recording from the radio program is owned by the estate of Bing Crosby and was loaned to CBS Sunday Morning for their December 25, 2011, program.) The song then appeared in his movie Holiday Inn (1942). His record hit the charts on October 3, 1942, and rose to No. 1 on October 31, where it stayed for 11 weeks. A holiday perennial, the song was repeatedly re-released by Decca, charting another sixteen times. It topped the charts again in 1945 and a third time in January 1947. The song remains the bestselling single of all time. According to Guinness World Records, his recording of \"White Christmas\" has sold over 100 million copies around the world, with at least 50 million sales as singles. His recording was so popular that he was obliged to re-record it in 1947 using the same musicians and backup singers; the original 1942 master had become damaged due to its frequent use in pressing additional singles. Although the two versions are similar, the 1947 recording is more familiar today. In 1977, after Crosby died, the song was re-released and reached No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart. Crosby was dismissive of his role in the song\\'s success, saying, \"A jackdaw with a cleft palate could have sung it successfully.\"\\n\\nMotion pictures:\\nIn the wake of a solid decade of headlining mainly smash hit musical comedy films in the 1930s, Crosby starred with Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour in seven Road to musical comedies between 1940 and 1962, cementing Crosby and Hope as an on-and-off duo, despite never officially declaring themselves a \"team\" in the sense that Laurel and Hardy or Martin and Lewis (Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis) were teams. The series consists of Road to Singapore (1940), Road to Zanzibar (1941), Road to Morocco (1942), Road to Utopia (1946), Road to Rio (1947), Road to Bali (1952), and The Road to Hong Kong (1962). When they appeared solo, Crosby and Hope frequently made note of the other in a comically insulting fashion. They performed together countless times on stage, radio, film, and television, and made numerous brief and not so brief appearances together in movies aside from the \"Road\" pictures, Variety Girl (1947) being an example of lengthy scenes and songs together along with billing.\\n\\nIn the 1949, Disney animated film The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad, Crosby provided the narration and song vocals for The Legend of Sleepy Hollow segment. In 1960, he starred in High Time, a collegiate comedy with Fabian Forte and Tuesday Weld that predicted the emerging gap between him and the new young generation of musicians and actors who had begun their careers after WWII. The following year, Crosby and Hope reunited for one more Road movie, The Road to Hong Kong, which teamed them up with the much younger Joan Collins and Peter Sellers. Collins was used in place of their longtime partner Dorothy Lamour, whom Crosby felt was getting too old for the role, though Hope refused to do the movie without her, and she instead made a lengthy and elaborate cameo appearance. Shortly before his death in 1977, he had planned another Road film in which he, Hope, and Lamour search for the Fountain of Youth.\\n\\nHe won an Academy Award for Best Actor for Going My Way in 1944 and was nominated for the 1945 sequel, The Bells of St. Mary\\'s. He received critical acclaim for his performance as an alcoholic entertainer in The Country Girl and received his third Academy Award nomination.\\n\\nTelevision:\\nThe Fireside Theater (1950) was his first television production. The series of 26-minute shows was filmed at Hal Roach Studios rather than performed live on the air. The \"telefilms\" were syndicated to individual television stations. He was a frequent guest on the musical variety shows of the 1950s and 1960s, appearing literally countless times on various variety shows as well as numerous late-night talk shows and his own highly rated specials. Bob Hope memorably devoted one of his monthly NBC specials to his long intermittent partnership with Crosby titled \"On the Road with Bing.\" Crosby was associated with ABC\\'s The Hollywood Palace as the show\\'s first and most frequent guest host and appeared annually on its Christmas edition with his wife Kathryn and his younger children, and continued after The Hollywood Palace was eventually canceled. In the early 1970s, he made two late appearances on the Flip Wilson Show, singing duets with the comedian. His last TV appearance was a Christmas special taped in London in September 1977 and aired weeks after his death. It was on this special that he recorded a duet of \"The Little Drummer Boy\" and \"Peace on Earth\" with rock star David Bowie. Their duet was released in 1982 as a single 45-rpm record and reached No. 3 in the UK singles charts. It has since become a staple of holiday radio and the final popular hit of Crosby\\'s career. At the end of the 20th century, TV Guide listed the Crosby-Bowie duet one of the 25 most memorable musical moments of 20th-century television.\\n\\nBing Crosby Productions, affiliated with Desilu Studios and later CBS Television Studios, produced a number of television series, including Crosby\\'s own unsuccessful ABC sitcom The Bing Crosby Show in the 1964–1965 seasons (with co-stars Beverly Garland and Frank McHugh). The company produced two ABC medical dramas, Ben Casey (1961–1966) and Breaking Point (1963–1964), the popular Hogan\\'s Heroes (1965–1971) military comedy on CBS, as well as the lesser-known show Slattery\\'s People (1964–1965).\\n\\nSinging style and vocal characteristics:\\nCrosby was one of the first singers to exploit the intimacy of the microphone rather than use the deep, loud vaudeville style associated with Al Jolson. He was, by his own definition, a \"phraser\", a singer who placed equal emphasis on both the lyrics and the music. His love for jazz helped bring the genre to a wider audience. In the framework of the novelty-singing style of the Rhythm Boys, he bent notes and added off-tune phrasing, an approach that was rooted in jazz. He had already been introduced to Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith before his first appearance on record. Crosby and Armstrong remained friends for decades. They sang \"Now You Has Jazz\" in the film High Society (1956).\\n\\nDuring the early portion of his solo career (about 1931–1934), Crosby\\'s emotional, often pleading style of crooning was popular. But Jack Kapp, manager of Brunswick and later Decca, talked him into dropping many of his jazzier mannerisms in favor of a clear vocal style. Crosby credited Kapp for choosing hit songs, working with many other musicians, and most importantly, diversifying his repertoire into several styles and genres. Kapp helped Crosby have number one hits in Christmas music, Hawaiian, and country music, and top-thirty hits in Irish music, French music, rhythm and blues, and ballads.\\n\\nCrosby elaborated on an idea of Al Jolson\\'s: phrasing, or the art of making a song\\'s lyric ring true. \"I used to tell Sinatra over and over,\" said Tommy Dorsey, \"there\\'s only one singer you ought to listen to and his name is Crosby. All that matters to him is the words, and that\\'s the only thing that ought to for you, too.\"\\n\\nCritic Henry Pleasants wrote:\\n[While] the octave B flat to B flat in Bing\\'s voice at that time [1930s] is, to my ears, one of the loveliest I have heard in forty-five years of listening to baritones, both classical and popular, it dropped conspicuously in later years. From the mid-1950s, Bing was more comfortable in a bass range while maintaining a baritone quality, with the best octave being G-to-G, or even F to F. In a recording he made of \\'Dardanella\\' with Louis Armstrong in 1960, he attacks lightly and easily on a low E flat. This is lower than most opera basses care to venture, and they tend to sound as if they were in the cellar when they get there.\\n\\nCareer statistics:\\nCrosby\\'s was among the most popular and successful musical acts of the 20th century. Billboard magazine used different methodologies during his career. But his chart success remains impressive: 396 chart singles, including roughly 25 No. 1 hits. Crosby had separate charting singles every year between 1931 and 1954; the annual re-release of \"White Christmas\" extended that streak to 1957. He had 24 separate popular singles in 1939 alone. He may have been the best selling recording artist with up to 1 billion units sold. Statistician Joel Whitburn at Billboard determined that Crosby was America\\'s most successful recording act of the 1930s and again in the 1940s.\\n\\nFor fifteen years (1934, 1937, 1940, 1943–1954), Crosby was among the top top ten acts in box-office sales, and for five of those years (1944–1948) he topped the world. He sang four Academy Award-winning songs – \"Sweet Leilani\" (1937), \"White Christmas\" (1942), \"Swinging on a Star\" (1944), \"In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening\" (1951) – and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Going My Way (1944).\\n\\nA survey in 2000 found that with 1,077,900,000 movie tickets sold, Crosby was the third most popular actor of all time, behind Clark Gable (1,168,300,000) and John Wayne (1,114,000,000). The International Motion Picture Almanac lists him in a tie for second on the All Time Number One Stars List with Clint Eastwood, Tom Hanks, and Burt Reynolds. His most popular film, White Christmas, grossed $30 million in 1954 ($280 million in current value).\\n\\nHe received 23 gold and platinum records, according to the book Million Selling Records. The Recording Industry Association of America did not institute its gold record certification program until 1958 when Crosby\\'s record sales were low. Before 1958, record companies awarded gold records. Universal Music, owner of Crosby\\'s Decca catalog, has never requested RIAA certification for any of his hit singles.\\n\\nCrosby charted 23 Billboard hits from 47-recorded songs with the Andrews Sisters, whose Decca record sales were second only to Crosby\\'s throughout the 1940s. They were his most frequent collaborators on disc from 1939 to 1952, a partnership that produced four million-selling singles: \"Pistol Packin\\' Mama\", \"Jingle Bells\", \"Don\\'t Fence Me In\", and \"South America, Take it Away\". They made one film appearance together in Road to Rio singing \"You Don\\'t Have to Know the Language\", and sang together on radio throughout the 1940s and 1950s. They appeared as guests on each other\\'s shows and on Armed Forces Radio Service during and after World War II. The quartet\\'s Top-10 Billboard hits from 1943 to 1945 include \"The Vict\\'ry Polka\", \"There\\'ll Be a Hot Time in the Town of Berlin (When the Yanks Go Marching In)\", and \"Is You Is or Is You Ain\\'t (Ma\\' Baby?)\" and helped morale of the American public.\\n\\nIn 1962, Crosby was given the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He has been inducted into the halls of fame for both radio and popular music. In 2007 he was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame and in 2008 the Western Music Hall of Fame.\\n\\nEntrepreneurship — Role in early tape recording:\\nDuring the Golden Age of Radio, performers had to create their shows live, sometimes even redoing the program a second time for the west coast time zone. Crosby had to do two live radio shows on the same day, three hours apart, for the East and West Coasts. Crosby\\'s radio career took a significant turn in 1945, when he clashed with NBC over his insistence that he be allowed to pre-record his radio shows. (The musicians’ union and ASCAP, which wanted to ensure continued work for their members also reinforced the live production of radio shows.) In On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio, John Dunning wrote about German engineers having developed a tape recorder with a near-professional broadcast quality standard:\\n\\n[Crosby saw] an enormous advantage in prerecording his radio shows. The scheduling could now be done at the star\\'s convenience. He could do four shows a week, if he chose, and then take a month off. But the networks and sponsors were adamantly opposed. The public wouldn\\'t stand for \\'canned\\' radio, the networks argued. There was something magic for listeners in the fact that what they were hearing was being performed and heard everywhere, at that precise instant. Some of the best moments in comedy came when a line was blown and the star had to rely on wit to rescue a bad situation. Fred Allen, Jack Benny, Phil Harris, and also Crosby were masters at this, and the networks weren\\'t about to give it up easily.\\n\\nCrosby\\'s insistence eventually factored into the further development of magnetic tape sound recording and the radio industry\\'s widespread adoption of it. He used his clout, both professional and financial, for innovations in audio. But NBC and CBS refused to broadcast prerecorded radio programs. Crosby left the network and remained off the air for seven months, creating a legal battle with his sponsor Kraft that was settled out of court. He returned to broadcasting for the last 13 weeks of the 1945–1946 seasons.\\n\\nThe Mutual network, on the other hand, pre-recorded some of its programs as early as 1938 for The Shadow with Orson Welles. ABC was formed from the sale of the NBC Blue Network in 1943 after a federal antitrust suit and was willing to join Mutual in breaking the tradition. ABC offered Crosby $30,000 per week to produce a recorded show every Wednesday that would be sponsored by Philco. He would get an additional $40,000 from 400 independent stations for the rights to broadcast the 30-minute show, which was sent to them every Monday on three 16-inch (40-cm) lacquer discs that played ten minutes per side at 33 1/3 rpm.\\n\\nCrosby wanted to change to recorded production for several reasons. The legend that has been most often told is that it would give him more time for golf. He did record his first Philco Radio Time program in August 1947 so he could enter the Jasper National Park Invitational Golf Tournament in September when the radio season was to start. But golf was not the most important reason. He wanted better quality recording, the ability to eliminate mistakes and the need to perform a second live show for the West Coast, and to control the timing of his performances. Because Bing Crosby Enterprises produced the show, he could purchase the best audio equipment and arrange the microphones his way; microphone placement had been debated in studios since the beginning of the electrical era. He would no longer have to wear the toupee that CBS and NBC required for his live audience shows — he preferred a hat. He could also record short promotions for his latest investment, the world\\'s first frozen orange juice, sold under the brand name Minute Maid. This investment allowed him to make more money by finding a loophole where the IRS couldn\\'t tax him at a 77% rate.\\n\\nMurdo MacKenzie of Bing Crosby Enterprises had seen a demonstration of the German Magnetophon in June 1947 — the same device that Jack Mullin had brought back from Radio Frankfurt with 50 reels of tape, at the end of the war. It was one of the magnetic tape recorders that BASF and AEG had built in Germany starting in 1935. The 6.5mm ferric-oxide-coated tape could record 20 minutes per reel of high-quality sound. Alexander M. Poniatoff ordered Ampex, which he founded in 1944, to manufacture an improved version of the Magnetophone.\\n\\nCrosby hired Mullin to start recording his Philco Radio Time show on his German-made machine in August 1947 using the same 50 reels of I.G. Farben magnetic tape that Mullin had found at a radio station at Bad Nauheim near Frankfurt while working for the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The advantage was editing. As Crosby wrote in his autobiography:\\n\\nBy using tape, I could do a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit it down to the twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or situations that didn\\'t play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn\\'t sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We\\'d dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.\\n\\nMullin\\'s 1976 memoir of these early days of experimental recording agrees with Crosby\\'s account:\\n\\nIn the evening, Crosby did the whole show before an audience. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it — thought it was very funny — but we would have to take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun with a song and not really working at it, we had to make it up out of two or three parts. This ad lib way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.\\n\\nCrosby invested US$50,000 in Ampex with the intent to produce more machines. In 1948, the second season of Philco shows was recorded with the Ampex Model 200A and Scotch 111 tape from 3M. Mullin explained how one new broadcasting technique was invented on the Crosby show with these machines:\\n\\nOne time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, was on the show, and he threw in a few of his folksy farm stories, which of course were not in Bill Morrow\\'s script. Today they wouldn\\'t seem very off-color, but things were different on radio then. They got enormous laughs, which just went on and on. We couldn\\'t use the jokes, but Bill asked us to save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn\\'t very funny, and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.\\n\\nCrosby started the tape recorder revolution in America. In his 1950 film Mr. Music, he is seen singing into an Ampex tape recorder that reproduced his voice better than anything else. Also quick to adopt tape recording was his friend Bob Hope. He gave one of the first Ampex Model 300 recorders to his friend, guitarist Les Paul, which led to Paul\\'s invention of multitrack recording. His organization, the Crosby Research Foundation, held tape recording patents and developed equipment and recording techniques such as the laugh track that are still in use today.\\n\\nWith Frank Sinatra, Crosby was of the principal backers for the United Western Recorders studio complex in Los Angeles.\\n\\nVideotape development:\\nMullin continued to work for Crosby to develop a videotape recorder (VTR). Television production was mostly live television in its early years, but Crosby wanted the same ability to record that he had achieved in radio. The Fireside Theater (1950) sponsored by Procter & Gamble, was his first television production. Mullin had not yet succeeded with videotape, so Crosby filmed the series of 26-minute shows at the Hal Roach Studios, and the \"telefilms\" were syndicated to individual television stations.\\n\\nCrosby continued to finance the development of videotape. Bing Crosby Enterprises gave the world\\'s first demonstration of videotape recording in Los Angeles on November 11, 1951. Developed by John T. Mullin and Wayne R. Johnson since 1950, the device aired what were described as \"blurred and indistinct\" images, using a modified Ampex 200 tape recorder and standard quarter-inch (6.3 mm) audio tape moving at 360 inches (9.1 m) per second.\\n\\nTV station ownership:\\nA Crosby-led group purchased station KCOP-TV, in Los Angeles, California, in 1954. NAFI Corporation and Crosby purchased television station KPTV in Portland, Oregon, for $4 million on September 1, 1959. In 1960, NAFI purchased KCOP from Crosby\\'s group. In the early 1950s, Crosby helped establish the CBS television affiliate in his hometown of Spokane, Washington. He partnered with Ed Craney, who owned the CBS radio affiliate KXLY (AM) and built a television studio west of Crosby\\'s alma mater, Gonzaga University. After it began broadcasting, the station was sold within a year to Northern Pacific Radio and Television Corporation.\\n\\nThoroughbred horse racing:\\nCrosby was a fan of thoroughbred horse racing and bought his first racehorse in 1935. In 1937, he became a founding partner of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club and a member of its board of directors. Operating from the Del Mar Racetrack at Del Mar, California, the group included millionaire businessman Charles S. Howard, who owned a successful racing stable that included Seabiscuit. Charles\\' son, Lindsay C. Howard, became one of Crosby\\'s closest friends; Crosby named his son Lindsay after him, and would purchase his 40-room Hillsborough, California estate from Lindsay in 1965.\\n\\nCrosby and Lindsay Howard formed Binglin Stable to race and breed thoroughbred horses at a ranch in Moorpark in Ventura County, California. They also established the Binglin stock farm in Argentina, where they raced horses at Hipódromo de Palermo in Palermo, Buenos Aires. A number of Argentine-bred horses were purchased and shipped to race in the United States. On August 12, 1938, the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club hosted a $25,000 winner-take-all match race won by Charles S. Howard\\'s Seabiscuit over Binglin\\'s horse Ligaroti.[68] In 1943, Binglin\\'s horse Don Bingo won the Suburban Handicap at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York.\\n\\nThe Binglin Stable partnership came to an end in 1953 as a result of a liquidation of assets by Crosby, who needed to raise enough funds to pay the hefty federal and state inheritance taxes on his deceased wife\\'s estate. The Bing Crosby Breeders\\' Cup Handicap at Del Mar Racetrack is named in his honor.\\n\\nSports:\\nCrosby had an interest in sports. In the 1930s, his friend and former college classmate, Gonzaga head coach Mike Pecarovich appointed Crosby as an assistant football coach. From 1946 until his death, he owned a 25% share of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Although he was passionate about the team, he was too nervous to watch the deciding Game 7 of the 1960 World Series, choosing to go to Paris with Kathryn and listen to its radio broadcast. Crosby had arranged for Ampex, another of his financial investments, to record the NBC telecast on kinescope. The game was one of the most famous in baseball history, capped off by Bill Mazeroski\\'s walk-off home run. He apparently viewed the complete film just once, and then stored it in his wine cellar, where it remained undisturbed until it was discovered in December 2009. The restored broadcast was shown on MLB Network in December 2010.\\n\\nCrosby was also an avid golfer, and in 1978, he and Bob Hope were voted the Bob Jones Award, the highest honor given by the United States Golf Association in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship. He is a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame. In 1937, Crosby hosted the first \\'Crosby Clambake\\' as it was popularly known, at Rancho Santa Fe Golf Club in Rancho Santa Fe, California, the event\\'s location prior to World War II. Sam Snead won the first tournament, in which the first place check was for $500. After the war, the event resumed play in 1947 on golf courses in Pebble Beach, where it has been played ever since. Now the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, it has been a leading event in the world of professional golf.\\n\\nCrosby first took up golf at 12 as a caddy, dropped it, and started again in 1930 with some fellow cast members in Hollywood during the filming of The King of Jazz. Crosby was accomplished at the sport, with a two handicap. He competed in both the British and U.S. Amateur championships, was a five-time club champion at Lakeside Golf Club in Hollywood, and once made a hole-in-one on the 16th at Cypress Point.\\n\\nCrosby was a keen fisherman especially in his younger days but it was a pastime that he enjoyed throughout his life. In the summer of 1966 he spent a week as the guest of Lord Egremont, staying in Cockermouth and fishing on the River Derwent. His trip was filmed for The American Sportsman on ABC, although all did not go well at first as the salmon were not running. He did make up for it at the end of the week by catching a number of sea trout.\\n\\nPersonal life:\\nCrosby was married twice. His first wife was actress and nightclub singer Dixie Lee to whom he was married from 1930 until her death from ovarian cancer in 1952. They had four sons: Gary, twins Dennis and Phillip, and Lindsay. The Smash-Up: The Story of a Woman (1947) is based on Lee\\'s life. The Crosby family lived at 10500 Camarillo Street in North Hollywood for over five years. After his wife died, Crosby had relationships with model Pat Sheehan (who married his son Dennis in 1958) and actresses Inger Stevens and Grace Kelly before marrying actress Kathryn Grant, who converted to Catholicism, in 1957. They had three children: Harry Lillis III (who played Bill in Friday the 13th), Mary (best known for portraying Kristin Shepard on TV\\'s Dallas), and Nathaniel (the 1981 U.S. Amateur champion in golf).\\n\\nCrosby reportedly had an alcohol problem in his youth, and may have been dismissed from Paul Whiteman\\'s orchestra because of it, but he later got a handle on his drinking. According to Giddins, Crosby told his son Gary to stay away from alcohol, adding, \"It killed your mother\" and suggesting he smoke marijuana instead. Crosby told Barbara Walters in a 1977 televised interview that he thought marijuana should be legalized.\\n\\nAfter Crosby\\'s death, his eldest son, Gary, wrote a highly critical memoir, Going My Own Way, depicting his father as cruel, cold, remote, and physically and psychologically abusive.\\n\\nWe had to keep a close watch on our actions ... When one of us left a sneaker or pair of underpants lying around, he had to tie the offending object on a string and wear it around his neck until he went off to bed that night. Dad called it \"the Crosby lavalier\". At the time the humor of the name escaped me ...\\n\\n\"Satchel Ass\" or \"Bucket Butt\" or \"My Fat-assed Kid\". That\\'s how he introduced me to his cronies when he dragged me along to the studio or racetrack ... By the time I was ten or eleven he had stepped up his campaign by adding lickings to the regimen. Each Tuesday afternoon he weighed me in, and if the scale read more than it should have, he ordered me into his office and had me drop my trousers ... I dropped my pants, pulled down my undershorts and bent over. Then he went at it with the belt dotted with metal studs he kept reserved for the occasion. Quite dispassionately, without the least display of emotion or loss of self-control, he whacked away until he drew the first drop of blood, and then he stopped. It normally took between twelve and fifteen strokes. As they came down I counted them off one by one and hoped I would bleed early ...\\n\\nWhen I saw Going My Way I was as moved as they were by the character he played. Father O\\'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too. Instead of coming down hard on the kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over. All the way back to the house I thought about the difference between the person up there on the screen and the one I knew at home.\\n\\nCrosby\\'s younger son Phillip vociferously disputed his brother Gary\\'s claims about their father. Around the time Gary made his claims, Phillip stated to the press that \"Gary is a whining, bitching crybaby, walking around with a two-by-four on his shoulder and just daring people to nudge it off.\" Nevertheless, Phillip did not deny that Crosby believed in corporal punishment. In an interview with People, Phillip stated that \"we never got an extra whack or a cuff we didn\\'t deserve.\" During an interview in 1999 by the Globe, Phillip said:\\n\\nMy dad was not the monster my lying brother said he was; he was strict, but my father never beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond memories of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I\\'ll hate Gary for dragging Dad\\'s name through the mud. He wrote Going My Own Way out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name was the only way he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was the only way he could get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.\\n\\nHowever, Dennis and Lindsay Crosby confirmed that Bing sometimes subjected his sons to harsh physical discipline and verbal put-downs. Regarding the writing of Gary\\'s memoir, Lindsay said, \"I\\'m glad [Gary] did it. I hope it clears up a lot of the old lies and rumors.\" Unlike Gary, though, Lindsay stated that he preferred to remember \"all the good things I did with my dad and forget the times that were rough.\" When the book was published, Dennis distanced himself by calling it \"Gary\\'s business\" but did not publicly deny its claims. Bing\\'s younger brother, singer and jazz bandleader Bob Crosby, recalled at the time of Gary\\'s revelations that Bing was a \"disciplinarian,\" as their mother and father had been. He added, \"We were brought up that way.\" In an interview for the same article, Gary clarified that Bing \"was like a lot of fathers of that time. He was not out to be vicious, to beat children for his kicks.\"\\n\\nCrosby\\'s will established a blind trust in which none of the sons received an inheritance until they reached the age of 65.\\n\\nLindsay Crosby died in 1989 at age 51, and Dennis Crosby died in 1991 at age 56, both by suicide from self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Gary Crosby died of lung cancer in 1995 at age 62, and Phillip Crosby died of a heart attack in 2004 at age 69.\\n\\nWidow Kathryn Crosby dabbled in local theater productions intermittently and appeared in television tributes to her late husband. Nathaniel Crosby, Crosby\\'s younger son from his second marriage, is a former high-level golfer who won the U.S. Amateur in 1981 at age 19, becoming the youngest winner in the history of that event at the time. Harry Crosby is an investment banker who occasionally makes singing appearances.\\n\\nDenise Crosby, Dennis Crosby\\'s daughter, is also an actress and is known for her role as Tasha Yar on Star Trek: The Next Generation and for the recurring role of the Romulan Sela after her withdrawal from the series as a regular cast member. She also appeared in the film adaptation of Stephen King\\'s novel Pet Sematary. In 2006, Crosby\\'s niece through his sister Mary Rose, Carolyn Schneider, published the laudatory book Me and Uncle Bing.\\n\\nThere have been disputes between Crosby\\'s two families beginning in the late 1990s. When Dixie died in 1952, her will provided that her share of the community property be distributed in trust to her sons. After Crosby\\'s death in 1977, he left the residue of his estate to a marital trust for the benefit of his widow, Kathryn, and HLC Properties, Ltd., was formed for the purpose of managing his interests, including his right of publicity. In 1996, Dixie\\'s trust sued HLC and Kathryn for declaratory relief as to the trust\\'s entitlement to interest, dividends, royalties, and other income derived from the community property of Crosby and Dixie. In 1999, the parties settled for approximately $1.5 million. Relying on a retroactive amendment to the California Civil Code, Dixie\\'s trust brought suit again, in 2010, alleging that Crosby\\'s right of publicity was community property, and that Dixie\\'s trust was entitled to a share of the revenue it produced. The trial court granted Dixie\\'s trust\\'s claim. The California Court of Appeal reversed, however, holding that the 1999 settlement barred the claim. In light of the court\\'s ruling, it was unnecessary for the court to decide whether a right of publicity can be characterized as community property under California law.\\n\\nIllness and death:\\nFollowing his recovery from a life-threatening fungal infection of his right lung in January 1974, Crosby emerged from semi-retirement to start a new spate of albums and concerts. In March 1977, after videotaping a concert at the Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena for CBS to commemorate his 50th anniversary in show business, and with Bob Hope looking on, Crosby fell off the stage into an orchestra pit, rupturing a disc in his back requiring a month in the hospital. His first performance after the accident was his last American concert, on August 16, 1977 (the day singer Elvis Presley died). When the electric power failed during his performance, he continued singing without amplification.\\n\\nIn September, Crosby, his family and singer Rosemary Clooney began a concert tour of Britain that included two weeks at the London Palladium. While in the UK, Crosby recorded his final album, Seasons, and his final TV Christmas special with guest David Bowie on September 11 (which aired a little over a month after Crosby\\'s death). His last concert was in the Brighton Centre on October 10, four days before his death, with British entertainer Dame Gracie Fields in attendance. The following day he made his final appearance in a recording studio and sang eight songs at the BBC Maida Vale studios for a radio program, which also included an interview with Alan Dell. Accompanied by the Gordon Rose Orchestra, Crosby\\'s last recorded performance was of the song \"Once in a While\". Later that afternoon, he met with Chris Harding to take photographs for the Seasons album jacket.\\n\\nOn October 13, 1977, Crosby flew alone to Spain to play golf and hunt partridge. On October 14, at the La Moraleja Golf Course near Madrid, Crosby played 18 holes of golf. His partner was World Cup champion Manuel Piñero; their opponents were club president César de Zulueta and Valentín Barrios. According to Barrios, Crosby was in good spirits throughout the day, and was photographed several times during the round. At the ninth hole, construction workers building a house nearby recognized him, and when asked for a song, Crosby sang \"Strangers in the Night\". Crosby, who had a 13 handicap, lost to his partner by one stroke. As Crosby and his party headed back to the clubhouse, Crosby said, \"That was a great game of golf, fellas.\" However his last words were reportedly, \"That was a great game of golf, fellas\" and then \"Let\\'s get a Coke.\" At about 6:30 pm, Crosby collapsed about 20 yards from the clubhouse entrance and died instantly from a massive heart attack. At the clubhouse and later in the ambulance, house physician Dr. Laiseca tried to revive him, but was unsuccessful. At Reina Victoria Hospital he was administered the last rites of the Catholic Church and was pronounced dead. On October 18, following a private funeral Mass at St. Paul\\'s Catholic Church in Westwood, Crosby was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. A plaque was placed at the golf course in his memory.\\n\\nLegacy:\\nOne of three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6769 Hollywood Blvd. He is a member of the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in the radio division. The family created an official website on October 14, 2007, the 30th anniversary of Crosby\\'s death. In his autobiography Don\\'t Shoot, It\\'s Only Me! (1990), Bob Hope wrote, \"Dear old Bing. As we called him, the Economy-sized Sinatra. And what a voice. God I miss that voice. I can\\'t even turn on the radio around Christmas time without crying anymore.\"\\n\\nCalypso musician Roaring Lion wrote a tribute song in 1939 titled \"Bing Crosby\", in which he wrote: \"Bing has a way of singing with his very heart and soul / Which captivates the world / His millions of listeners never fail to rejoice / At his golden voice...\"\\n\\nBing Crosby Stadium in Front Royal, Virginia, was named after Crosby in honor of his fundraising and cash contributions for its construction from 1948 to 1950. In 2006, the former Metropolitan Theater of Performing Arts (\\'The Met\\') in Spokane, Washington was renamed to The Bing Crosby Theater. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Bing Crosby among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bing+Crosby\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'When singer-songwriter Bird York—also an actor and screenwriter—composed the 2006 Academy Award-nominated song “In The Deep” for the Oscar-nominated film Crash, she had no visuals to go on, only a draft of the script by writer-director Paul Haggis. York originally met Haggis in 2000 when she appeared in and conceived music for his critically acclaimed series Family Law, and their fluid collaboration grew out of the fast pace demanded by a weekly hour-long series. Featuring Bird’s soulful vocals, “In The Deep”—which also appears on York’s major label debut Wicked Little High--wraps an ethereal and haunting aural blanket around Crash’s onscreen narrative in a pivotal final sequence, when the crushed and ravaged characters each reflect, in solitude, on what has happened.   \\n  Quiet, mesmerizing and anything but comforting, the song lingers in memory. \\n\\nNic Harcourt, respected music guru at NPR flagship KCRW-FM/Los Angeles, has called Bird, “a songwriter of extraordinary depth with a voice to match.” Billboard’s Chris Morris has written--citing her “melodic grace” and affecting honesty”--that, “Bird York\\'s songs subtly reveal those things that rise out of the corners of the night: Memory, reverie, desire, and the emotions that lie cloaked when the sun is high.” York began writing songs in her teens, after both her parents died, and her resonant compositions reflect hard-won life experience and a survivor’s mettle. “I’m fifteen, homeless, and some older ex-hippie guy gives me a beat-up guitar,” she says. “When most girls are worried about what to wear, I am wondering about where I am going to sleep. But I have this guitar and decided I was going to write myself a song to ride out of the freak show called TOO MUCH TOO SOON”\\n  “In The Deep” is just one in a sensual and intoxicatingly hypnotic collection of songs on York’s Narada/EMI major label album debut, Wicked Little High. Elegantly delivered and emotionally stirring, the disc subliminally slips, slowly but inevitably, deep into your consciousness with a sound that Music Biz Magazine called “torch trip hop.” The album opens with the richly textured and subtly psychedelic “Had A Dream,” produced by GRAMMY®-winning engineer/mixer Thom Russo (Macy Gray, Audioslave). The song swirls around the thoughts, “where logic ends, faith begins,” and, “wondering if we just try and risk everything for love/how can we ever go wrong.”  \\nOther stand-outs include the title track, an ironic meditation on the downside of a physical attraction that counters logic and wisdom but persists nevertheless—“Desire is such a wicked little high when the one you want is blind to you.” York’s insightful lyrics and seductive, smoky vocals make the notion of “the fifth drink before a long drive home” palpable. Wicked Little High also includes collaborations with GRAMMY®-winning producer Larry Klein (Joni Mitchell, Madeline Peyroux), and songs from the album have already aired on the network television shows House, CSI:NY, Everwood, Jake 2.0 and In Justice, as well as in the John Cusack-produced film Never Get Outta The Boat and the New line feature Peaceful Warrior. Songs from her critically acclaimed debut cd have been featured on Nip/Tuck as well as other film and tv projects.\\n  Possessed by a “driving desire to make things,” Bird York’s artistry is manifested across multiple disciplines. Her extensive acting credits include an ongoing role on NBC’s The West Wing, appearing in over sixteen episodes of the EMMY and Golden Globe winning show as Andy Wyatt. York has also appeared on Curb Your Enthusiasm as well as played the starring role in the NBC bio pic mini series LOVE CAN BUILD A BRIDGE portraying Naomi Judd from 25-45. On the big screen, she’s performed in features with Dennis Hopper, Diane Keaton, Julianna Margulies and Tom Waits, currently completing filming on SUBLIME opposite Tom Cavanaugh for Warner Bros?Raw Feed and is about to begin filming on the indie FOOTSTEPS this July. \\n\\nOn the writing side, beyond composing, York has just compeleted a screenplay for John Wells /Warner Bros. Television, and a music-based series that she developed has been sold to Sony. \\n  With everything she’s accomplished, York notes that over the years, she’s often taken the road less traveled and turned down opportunities that didn’t allow her to follow her heart or that reigned in her creativity. “I live for that tingly moment,” she says. “Even if something doesn’t work out, I could die knowing that I listened to my heart. My life really is about passion, my passion for humanity and I don’t think you should have to compartmentalize passion--I want to sing about it, write about it, and embody it in acting roles. I’m a storyteller, and my intention is to tell stories that elevate the human condition.” \\n“I am interested in how music can change the molecules in a room,” she says, “and how music can make you want to slip out of your clothes and kiss someone. \" Right now, that passion is transcendent through Bird York’s music via the Academy Award-nominated song “In The Deep” and her new album Wicked Little High. \\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bird+York\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'There are several artists named Black Coffee:\\n\\n1) -   Durban-born (South Africa) Nkosinathi Maphumulo has been on the music scene for over a decade but only got his break a few years ago. Nkosinathi, otherwise known as Black Coffee, is popular for his smash hit remixes, most of which have dominated the airwaves in the past couple of years.\\n\\nThis maestro DJ and producer forged his musical background with his school choir and by studying the keyboard. He studied music in Durban because he felt that as a producer, he had to deepen his overall musical knowledge, develop his listening skills and advance his knowledge of music theory.\\n2003 saw Black Coffee starting to put his first project together. He revealed that his first album was created using very basic music-making software. “I don\\'t know how to explain the production stages of my album because all I did was put down the basic ideas that I had. I didn\\'t use any MIDI controllers or anything along those sophisticated lines. All I did was program the beats.”\\n\\nAfter the successful 12” release of Black Coffee’s underground hit ‘Kwanele’, Kronologik brings you the self-titled debut album from South Africa’s prolific awarding winning DJ/producer.\\n\\nNathi ‘Black Coffee’ Maphumulo began his DJ career back in 1994 while still in High School. While studying Music in Natal Technikon, he formed ‘Shana’ – a band that has gone on to record and release four albums. In 2001 he was offered an opportunity to freelance for various clubs and promoters until securing a residency at Voodoo Lounge nightclub - the most happening club of it’s time. In 2003 he was chosen as one of two South African participants in the Red Bull Music Academy which jumpstarted him into the South African DJ scene. So much so that he was given the prime weekend dance slot on Umhlobo Wenene (Saturday’s 8-10) – a show featuring the most international DJ’s on South African radio. In 2006 Black Coffee triumphed in the category of Best Dance Album at the prestigious South African Music Awards and in 2007 he was picked to play at the Red Bull Music Academy lounge at the Sonar festival in Barcelona. Black Coffee has played alongside the cream of local and international DJ’s including Little Louie Vega, Alix Alvarez, Franck Roger, Charles Webster, DJ Spinna and Osunlade. \\n\\n\\n\\nNow ‘Black Coffee’ - the SAMA award winning album gets an international release through Kronologik Music. Twelve tracks of deep, soulful, afro house music featuring artists such as Mabe Thobejane, Busi Mhlongo, Shana and Mafikizolo.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe album also includes Black Coffee’s remixes of classic tracks like Hugh Masekela\\'s 1972 masterpiece, \\'Stimela\\', Thandiswa\\'s \\'Kwanele\\' and ‘S Khuzile’ by Brothers Of Peace - all in his inimitable Kwaito style. If you are wondering what Kwaito is - its South Africa’s home-grown music that is based on US house music infused with South African melodies and rhythms. \\n\\n\\n\\nOther well known Black Coffee tracks that have already done the rounds on the underground house circuit are featured on the album.  Tracks like ‘Happiness’, the big hit from the DJs At Work compilation album, ‘Love Life Generation – House Generation’ and the deeper than deep soulful classic ‘Music’ which was included on Keith Thompson’s ‘Worlds Collide Volume 1’. \\n\\nOne listen to this album and you’ll see why it scooped the Best Dance Album award at the South African Music Awards.\\n\\n2) -    Чёрный кофе (Cherniy Kofe/Black Coffee) a Russian heavy metal band, singing both in Russian and in English.\\n\\n3) -   A Swedish band (http://www.blackcoffee.se/)\\n\\n4) -   Black Coffee is a famous jazz group from Split , Croatia active since 1993.\\nIn 1996. they released their first album titled simply \"BLACK COFFEE\".

       " 'Black Rob (born Robert Ross) was a rapper formerly signed to Bad Boy Records. He began associating with the label as early as 1996, appearing on several Bad Boy albums, as well as other projects. These guest appearances earned him a media buzz and he kept attention with the smash hit single \"Whoa!\". Following this, the album Life Story was released in 2000 and rose above Platinum sales. His second album, The Black Rob Report, failed to perform as strongly as his debut and quickly disappeared from the Billboard 100 charts.\\n\\nRoss has a history of arrests spanning from his childhood to even after his record label signing and album release. This culminated in him recently being sentenced to seven years in prison in 2006 for failing to show up to court for his sentencing (which was to be 2 – 6 years initially) in a grand larceny charge from 2004, in which he was accused of robbing more than $6,000 worth of jewelry from a hotel room. He was released from prison in May 2010, cutting ties with Bad Boy and releasing his third album Game Tested, Streets Approved the following year on July 26, 2011 via Duck Down Music.

       " 'From the very first note of his new album, Not Too Bad, there\\'s no doubt where Blaine Larsen stands on making music -- his own kind of music. Each song is marked by an easy confidence and a sound that is unapologetically country. With two studio projects already under his belt at age 23, the Washington state native is now more focused than ever on making music that will sound just as good in the decades to come as it does today. In short, Blaine is an artist whose music will never go out of style. \\n\\n\"I\\'m not gonna be the guy that\\'s out chasing whatever\\'s hot right now and following someone else\\'s lead,\" Blaine explains. \"Styles will come and go, but I feel like the kind of music I\\'m making will always be around.\" \\n\\nA big reason for Blaine\\'s resolute sense of direction on this project comes from some major experiences he\\'s been through lately. The powerful lead single \"It Did\" closely mirrors Blaine\\'s own journey over the last three years -- marrying his wife Sammie and welcoming their first child Zoe last year. Those events also influence Blaine\\'s performance of the album\\'s title cut, \"Not Too Bad for a Good Old Boy,\" and the playful \"Baby You Get Me.\" \\n\\n\"They always say in music that the more experience you\\'ve got, the deeper you can go. I think that\\'s showing up on this record. There\\'s stuff I can sing about now that I wouldn\\'t have been able to do before because I hadn\\'t lived through it.\" \\n\\nBlaine\\'s newfound perspective also shows up in his performance of \"Never Gonna Feel That Way Again\" -- telling the story of a high school football player realizing the surprising joy in unexpected fatherhood -- as well as \"Some Day When I\\'m Old,\" which takes a humorous look at what the golden years will look like. Perhaps the biggest musical surprise on the project comes in the tune \"Leavin\\'.\" It\\'s easily the most dynamic performance Blaine\\'s ever put to tape. \\n\\n\"\\'Leavin\\' is a really rocking song. You can\\'t really tone it down, and it shouldn\\'t be toned down. It ended up being one of my favorites because it was just so different for me.\"\\n\\nWhen it came to recording Not Too Bad, Blaine\\'s vision was quite clear on the style of music he wanted and which Music Row session guys could help him pull it off. The same tight group of ace musicians played on the entire album, giving it a unified sound. In the process, Blaine grew as a musician himself and even took the lead guitar part on the album\\'s mid-tempo standout tracks, \"What\\'s Not to Love\" and \"Never Gonna Feel Like That Again.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve always played guitar on my own stuff in concert, but I\\'ve never really played much on the record until now . Our guitar player Brent Mason didn\\'t have time to do these songs in the studio. I just said, \\'Why don\\'t I just do it.\\' I\\'m not a virtuoso, but I know what I like and I can play what I hear in my head. I\\'m good at playing my own stuff. I had the most fun playing guitar on this record.\"\\n\\nWhile making Not Too Bad has been the experience of a lifetime for Blaine, one recent accomplishment just might trump it on his list of career milestones. In the process of making his latest record, Blaine\\'s also been establishing himself as a songwriter in Nashville, and he\\'s already taken the holy grail for any Music City tunesmith -- a George Strait cut. Blaine co-wrote \"I Gotta Get To You,\" which is included on Strait\\'s 2009 release Twang.\\n\\n\"I found out George had cut it on a Friday morning while driving in my truck. I remember pulling over on the side of the road and crying like a baby. Having George Strait cut my song -- that\\'s done. Nothing or no one can take that away. That\\'s something I\\'ll be telling my grandkids.\"\\n\\nAmazingly, the Strait cut is the first time Blaine\\'s had one of his songs cut by an artist other than himself, but he\\'s no stranger to country\\'s A-list when it comes to performing. Tours with the likes of Brad Paisley, Rascal Flatts, and Kenny Chesney have put Blaine in front of country music\\'s biggest audiences in the past few years, and that excitement of performing live is a big part of what keeps Blaine in the music business chasing this crazy dream.\\n\\n\"It\\'s an adrenaline rush beyond anything you can imagine. It\\'s kind of like a roller coaster. It\\'s those good nights onstage that keep you going and remind you of why you love making music. When I\\'m performing live, I know this is what I\\'m supposed to be doing, and I\\'m where I\\'m supposed to be.\" \\n\\nOf course, it\\'s Blaine\\'s fans who give him those amazing nights onstage. It\\'s often said that country fans are the most loyal on earth, and Blaine has experienced that loyalty first hand.\\n\\n\"Saying thank you to those people just isn\\'t enough because they keep me employed and pay my bills. It\\'s great to get this new music out to them because they\\'ve been waiting for a long time. There\\'s a lot going on that I\\'ve haven\\'t been able to share with people until now. I promise them, it\\'s going to be worth the wait.\"  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Blaine+Larsen\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Gwen Renée Stefani  (born October 3, 1969 in Fullerton, CA) is an American singer-songwriter and fashion designer. Since 1986 she has fronted the rock band No Doubt, whose 1995 release Tragic Kingdom spawned the singles Just a Girl, Spiderwebs, and Don\\'t Speak and propelled them into stardom with sales of 16 million copies worldwide. \\n\\nIn 2004, Stefani released her first solo album Love. Angel. Music. Baby. The album featured several collaborations with producers and other artists, including No Doubt bandmate Tony Kanal, Linda Perry, André 3000, Nellee Hooper, and The Neptunes. It was primarily inspired by pop and new wave music of the 1980s, and emerged an international success with sales of over seven million copies. The third single Hollaback Girl became the first U.S. digital download to sell one million copies.\\n\\nThe debut album also drew attention to the Harajuku Girls, Stefani\\'s entourage of four Japanese backup dancers named for the fashionable suburb in Tokyo. Originally hired in 2004 for the album, the Girls continued to appear alongside Stefani, and are featured in these music videos: \"What You Waiting For?\", \"Rich Girl\", \"Hollaback Girl\", \"Luxurious\", \"Crash\", \"Wind It Up\", \"The Sweet Escape\", and \"Now That You Got It\".\\n\\nStefani\\'s second solo album The Sweet Escape was released December 5, 2006. Collaborating again with her on the project were Perry, The Neptunes, along with Akon and Tim Rice-Oxley of Keane, and producers Pharrell and Kanal. Despite mixed reviews of the album as a whole, the title track The Sweet Escape became an international success and earned Stefani a Grammy nomination, and remains the most successful song of her solo career.\\n\\nAlthough it had been speculated that the album would contain only material originally written for L.A.M.B. that did not make the final cut, only two songs left over from L.A.M.B. were included in the record: 80\\'s-influenced U Started It; and Wonderful Life, which features Depeche Mode\\'s Martin L. Gore on guitar.\\n\\nStefani is equally known as a fashion trendsetter. In 2003, she created a clothing fashion line named L.A.M.B. which shares the initials of her debut solo album. This collection was later expanded with the introduction of a newer line in 2005 called Harajuku Lovers, which draws its inspiration from Japanese culture and fashion.\\n\\nOn May 26, 2006, Stefani gave birth to her first child, a baby boy named Kingston James McGregor Rossdale. The father is British grunge musician Gavin Rossdale, former frontman of the now-defunct bands Bush and Institute, who she married in 2002. \\n\\nIn January 2008, Stefani\\'s now ex-father-in-law confirmed that she would be expecting her second child in the summer.

She and Williams were coaches for season 7 of The Voice. After nine years since her last appearance, she attended the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, and during an interview on the red carpet she said, \"I didn\\'t know I was gonna have a baby, I didn\\'t know I was gonna be on The Voice, I didn\\'t know I was gonna be writing new music, so I\\'m just like, what\\'s gonna be next?\".\\n\\nOn September 8, 2014, Stefani told MTV News during New York Fashion Week that she is working on both a No Doubt album and a solo album.

Billboard magazine revealed that her third studio album is set to be released in December and Benny Blanco is set to executive produce it. In late October, a sneak peek of a new track from Stefani\\'s third album, named \"Spark the Fire\", was premiered. The song was produced by Pharrell Williams.\\n\\nOn October 17, 2015, Stefani performed a one-night concert at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City, where she performed a new song, reportedly about her breakup with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale, titled \"Used to Love You\". It was released as a digital download on October 20, 2015. The video was released later that same day. The song was released to Mainstream radio in the U.S. on October 27, 2015. The track is the first official single off her third solo album, This Is What the Truth Feels Like, which she has been working on since June of that year. Neither \"Baby Don\\'t Lie\" or \"Spark the Fire\" were included on the album. Stefani said much of the previous material felt forced and inauthentic, while the songs written since she returned to the studio are more natural and better describe where she is in her life.

       " 'Edwin Starr (January 21, 1942 – April 2, 2003) was an American soul music singer. Born Charles Edwin Hatcher in Nashville, Tennessee, Starr is most famous for his Norman Whitfield produced Motown singles of the 1970s, most notably the number one hit War.\\n\\nEdwin Starr was born in Nashville, Tennessee in 1942. He and his cousins (soul singers Roger and Willie Hatcher) moved to Cleveland, Ohio where they were raised.\\n\\nIn 1957 Starr formed a doo-wop group The Future Tones and began his singing career. Starr lived in Detroit, Michigan in the 1960s and recorded at first for the small record label Ric-Tic, and later for the famed Motown after it absorbed Ric-Tic in 1968.\\n\\nThe song which began his career was \"Agent Double\\'O\\'Soul\" (1965), a take-off on the James Bond films which were popular at the time.\\n\\nHe recorded more soul music for the next three years before having an international chart-topper in \"25 Miles\" (1968). As of 2005 it is one of only two Starr songs on oldies radio.\\n\\nThe biggest hit of his career, which cemented his reputation as a great soul artist, was the anti-Vietnam War protest song \"War\" (1970). A rousing tour-de-force, the vocals to \"War\" were - according to Starr - recorded in one take: an accomplishment which might make modern artists quail with apprehension. In explanation, Starr remained characteristically modest, explaining that he\\'d been allocated little studio time, so had to give each song his best shot.\\n\\nStarr\\'s intense vocals transformed a Temptations album track into a #1 chart success, which spent three weeks in that top position on the US Billboard charts, an anthem for the antiwar movement and a cultural milestone that continues to resound a generation later in movie soundtracks and hip hop music samples.\\n\\n\"War\" appeared on both Starr\\'s War and Peace LP and its follow-up, Involved. Involved also featured another song of very similar construction titled \"Stop the War Now\", which was a minor hit in its own right.\\n\\nMoving to England in 1973, Starr continued to record music into the 1970s, most notably recording the song \"Hell Up In Harlem\" for the 1974 film, Hell Up In Harlem, which was the sequel to Black Caesar, an earlier hit with a soundtrack by James Brown.\\n\\nIn 1979 Starr reappeared on the charts with a pair of disco hits, titled \"(Eye-To-Eye) Contact\" and \"H.A.P.P.Y. Radio\". By now he had joined the well-established disco boom, and had further singles out on the record label 20th Century Records. Over the years he released tracks on many labels including Avatar, Calibre, 10 Records, Motown (a return to his former label for a 1989 remix of \"25 Miles\"), Streetwave and Hippodrome.\\n\\nIn 1985 Starr released \"It Ain\\'t Fair\". Despite garnering the attention of many in the soul and dance clubs, it fell short of becoming the hit many felt it deserved to be.\\n\\nIn 1988 Starr teamed up with the popular and successful Stock, Aitken and Waterman production company for the club hit \"Whatever Makes Our Love Grow\".\\n\\nIn 1989, a number 17 uk hit by the Cookie Crew called \"Got to Keep On\" sampled a portion of \"25 Miles\" [1]. This track was then featured on a 1990 dance medley made for the BRIT Awards which made number 2 in the UK Singles Chart [2].

       " 'Bo Bice has music in his blood. Born Harold Bice in Huntsville, Alabama on Nov. 1, 1975, Bo was raised in the south by his song-singing, instrument-playing, music-worshiping parents.

       " 'Ellas McDaniel (born Ellas Otha Bates, December 30, 1928 – June 2, 2008), known as Bo Diddley, was an American rhythm & blues and rock & roll singer, guitarist, songwriter and music producer. He is cited as a key figure in the transition of blues into rock and roll, by introducing more insistent, driving rhythms and a harder-edged guitar sound. His use of African rhythms and the signature \"Bo Diddley beat\", a simple five-accent hambone rhythm, is a cornerstone of  r&b, rock, pop and hip hop. In recognition of his achievements, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation and a Grammy Award from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. He is also recognized for his technical innovations, including his distinctive rectangular guitar.\\n\\nBorn in McComb, Mississippi, as Ellas Otha Bates, he was adopted and raised by his mother\\'s cousin, Gussie McDaniel, whose surname he assumed. In 1934, the McDaniel family moved to the South Side of Chicago, where he dropped the Otha and became Ellas McDaniel. He was an active member of Chicago\\'s Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he studied the trombone and the violin, becoming so proficient on the violin that the musical director invited him to join the orchestra. He performed until he was 18. However, he was more interested in the pulsating, rhythmic music he heard at a local Pentecostal church and took up the guitar.\\n\\nInspired by a performance by John Lee Hooker, he supplemented his income as a carpenter and mechanic by playing on street corners with friends, including Jerome Green (c. 1934–1973), in the Hipsters band, later renamed the Langley Avenue Jive Cats. Green became a near-constant member of McDaniel\\'s backing band, the two often trading joking insults with each other during live shows. During the summer of 1943–1944, he played at the Maxwell Street market in a band with Earl Hooker. By 1951 he was playing on the street with backing from Roosevelt Jackson on washtub bass and Jody Williams, whom he had taught to play the guitar. Williams later played lead guitar on \"Who Do You Love?\" (1956).\\n\\nIn 1951 he landed a regular spot at the 708 Club, on Chicago\\'s South Side, with a repertoire influenced by Louis Jordan, John Lee Hooker, and Muddy Waters. In late 1954, he teamed up with harmonica player Billy Boy Arnold, drummer Clifton James and bass player Roosevelt Jackson and recorded demos of \"I\\'m a Man\" and \"Bo Diddley\". They re-recorded the songs at Chess Studios, with a backing ensemble comprising Otis Spann (piano), Lester Davenport (harmonica), Frank Kirkland (drums), and Jerome Green (maracas). The record was released in March 1955, and the A-side, \"Bo Diddley\", became a number one R&B hit.\\n\\nThe origin of the stage name Bo Diddley is unclear. McDaniel claimed that his peers gave him the name, which he suspected was an insult. He also said that the name first belonged to a singer his adoptive mother knew. Harmonicist Billy Boy Arnold said that it was a local comedian\\'s name, which Leonard Chess adopted as McDaniel\\'s stage name and the title of his first single. Guitar craftsman Ed Roman stated that it was McDaniel\\'s nickname as a Golden Gloves boxer.\\n\\nA diddley bow is a homemade single-string instrument played mainly by farm workers in the South. It probably has influences from the West African coast. In the American slang term bo diddly, bo is an intensifier and diddly is a truncation of diddly squat, which means \"absolutely nothing\".\\n\\nOn November 20, 1955, Bo Diddley appeared on the popular television program The Ed Sullivan Show. When someone on the show\\'s staff overheard him casually singing \"Sixteen Tons\" in the dressing room, he was asked to perform the song on the show. Because he could not read, when he saw \"Bo Diddley\" on the cue card, he thought he was to perform both his hit single and \"Sixteen Tons\". Sullivan was furious and banned Bo Diddley from his show, reputedly saying that he wouldn\\'t last six months. Chess Records included Bo Diddley\\'s \"Sixteen Tons\" on the 1960 album Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger.\\n\\nBo Diddley\\'s hit singles continued in the 1950s and 1960s: \"Pretty Thing\" (1956), \"Say Man\" (1959), and \"You Can\\'t Judge a Book by the Cover\" (1962). He also released numerous albums, including Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger and Have Guitar, Will Travel. These bolstered his self-invented legend. Between 1958 and 1963, Checker Records released eleven full-length Bo Diddley albums. In the 1960s he broke through as a crossover artist with white audiences (appearing at the Alan Freed concerts, for example), but he rarely aimed his compositions at teenagers. The album title Surfing with Bo Diddley derived from his influence on surf guitarists rather than surfing per se.\\n\\nIn 1963, Bo Diddley starred in a UK concert tour with the Everly Brothers and Little Richard. The up-and-coming Rolling Stones were billed as a supporting act.\\n\\nHe wrote many songs for himself and also for others. In 1956 he and guitarist Jody Williams co-wrote the pop song \"Love Is Strange\", a hit for Mickey & Sylvia in 1957. He also wrote \"Mama (Can I Go Out)\", which was a minor hit for the pioneering rockabilly singer Jo Ann Campbell, who performed the song in the 1959 rock and roll film Go Johnny Go.\\n\\nBo Diddley included women in his band: Norma-Jean Wofford, also known as The Duchess; Gloria Jolivet; Peggy Jones, also known as Lady Bo, a lead guitarist (rare for a woman at that time); Cornelia Redmond, also known as Cookie V; Debby Hastings, who led his band for the final 25 years. After moving from Chicago to Washington, D.C., he set up one of the first home recording studios, where he not only recorded the album Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger but produced and recorded his valet, Marvin Gaye. Bo Diddley co-wrote the Marquees\\' record \"Wyatt Earp\", the first single to feature Gaye. It was released on Okeh Records, after the Chess brothers turned it down. During this time, Moonglows\\' founder Harvey Fuqua sang backing vocals on many of Bo Diddley\\'s home recordings. Gaye later joined the Moonglows and followed them to Motown.\\n\\nOver the decades, Bo Diddley\\'s performing venues ranged from intimate clubs to stadiums. On March 25, 1972, he played with the Grateful Dead at the Academy of Music in New York City. The Grateful Dead released part of this concert as Volume 30 of the band\\'s concert album series, Dick\\'s Picks. Also in the early 1970s, the soundtrack of the ground-breaking animated film Fritz the Cat contained his song \"Bo Diddley\", in which a crow idly finger-pops to the track.\\n\\nBo Diddley spent some years in New Mexico, living in Los Lunas from 1971 to 1978, while continuing his musical career. He served for two and a half years as a deputy sheriff in the Valencia County Citizens\\' Patrol; during that time he purchased and donated three highway-patrol pursuit cars. In the late 1970s, he left Los Lunas and moved to Hawthorne, Florida, where he lived on a large estate in a custom-made log cabin, which he helped to build. For the remainder of his life he divided his time between Albuquerque and Florida, living the last 13 years of his life in Archer, Florida, a small farming town near Gainesville.\\n\\nIn 1979, he appeared as an opening act for the Clash on their US tour and in Legends of Guitar (filmed live in Spain, 1991), with B.B. King, Les Paul, Albert Collins, and George Benson, among others. He joined the Rolling Stones on their 1994 concert broadcast of Voodoo Lounge, performing \"Who Do You Love?\" with the band. Sheryl Crow and Robert Cray also appeared on the pay-per-view special.\\n\\nFrom 1985 until he died, his touring band consisted of Jim Satten (guitarist, band leader, musical director); Scott \"Skyntyte\" Free, Nunzio Signore or Frank Daley (guitar); Tom Major, Dave Johnson, Yoshi Shimada, Mike Fink or Sandy Gennaro (drums); John Margolis, Dave Keys or personal manager Margo Lewis (keyboards); and Debby Hastings (bassist and musical director).\\n\\nBo Diddley performed a number of shows around the country in 2005 and 2006 with fellow Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Johnnie Johnson and his band, consisting of Johnson on keyboards, Richard Hunt on drums and Gus Thornton on bass. In 2006, he participated as the headliner of a grassroots-organized fundraiser concert to benefit the town of Ocean Springs, Mississippi, which had been devastated by Hurricane Katrina. The \"Florida Keys for Katrina Relief\" had originally been set for October 23, 2005, when Hurricane Wilma barreled through the Florida Keys on October 24, causing flooding and economic mayhem. In January 2006, the Florida Keys had recovered enough to host the fundraising concert to benefit the more hard-hit community of Ocean Springs. When asked about the fundraiser, Bo Diddley stated, \"This is the United States of America. We believe in helping one another\". In an interview with Holger Petersen, on Saturday Night Blues on CBC Radio in the fall of 2006, he commented on racism in the music industry establishment during his early career, which deprived him of royalties from the most successful part of his career.\\n\\nHis final guitar performance on a studio album was with the New York Dolls on their 2006 album One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This. He contributed guitar work to the song \"Seventeen\", which was included as a bonus track on the limited-edition version of the disc.\\n\\nBo Diddley fought the sportswear brand Nike in his later years over alleged copyright infringement, specifically over the use of his likeness and the slogan \"You don\\'t know diddley.\" In 1989, he had worked with Nike on a commercial in the \"Bo Knows\" campaign and had entered into a licensing agreement with the company. The agreement ended in 1991.[29] When Nike began selling the apparel again in 1999, he felt that Nike should not continue to use the slogan or his likeness. Despite the fact that lawyers for both parties could not come to a renewed legal arrangement, Nike allegedly continued marketing the apparel and ignored cease-and-desist orders.[30] The lawsuit was filed by attorney John Rosenberg in Manhattan Federal Court.\\n\\nOn May 13, 2007, Bo Diddley was admitted to intensive care in Creighton University Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, following a stroke after a concert the previous day in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Starting the show, he had complained that he did not feel well. He referred to smoke from the wildfires that were ravaging south Georgia and blowing south to the area near his home in Archer, Florida. Nonetheless, he delivered an energetic performance to an enthusiastic crowd. The next day, as he was heading back home, he seemed dazed and confused at the airport. His manager, Margo Lewis, called 911 and airport security, and the musician was immediately taken by ambulance to Creighton University Medical Center and admitted to the Intensive-care unit, where he stayed for several days. After tests, it was confirmed that he had suffered a stroke. Bo Diddley had a history of hypertension and diabetes, and the stroke affected the left side of his brain, causing receptive and expressive aphasia (speech impairment). The stroke was followed by a heart attack, which he suffered in Gainesville, Florida, on August 28, 2007.\\n\\nWhile recovering from the stroke and heart attack, Bo Diddley came back to his home town of McComb, Mississippi, in early November 2007, for the unveiling of a plaque devoted to him on the Mississippi Blues Trail. This marked his achievements and noted that he was \"acclaimed as a founder of rock-and-roll.\" He was not supposed to perform, but as he listened to the music of local musician Jesse Robinson, who sang a song written for this occasion, Robinson sensed that Bo Diddley wanted to perform and handed him a microphone, the only time that he performed publicly after his stroke.\\n\\nBo Diddley died on June 2, 2008, of heart failure at his home in Archer, Florida. Garry Mitchell, his grandson and one of more than 35 family members at the musician\\'s home when he died at 1:45 a.m. EDT (05:45 GMT), said his death was not unexpected. \"There was a gospel song that was sung (at his bedside) and (when it was done) he said \\'wow\\' with a thumbs up,\" Mitchell told Reuters, when asked to describe the scene at the deathbed. \"The song was \\'Walk Around Heaven\\' and in his last words he said \\'I\\'m going to heaven.\\'\"\\n\\nHis funeral, a four-hour \"homegoing\" service, took place on June 7, 2008, at Showers of Blessings Church in Gainesville, Florida, and kept in tune with the vibrant spirit of Bo Diddley\\'s life and career. The many in attendance chanted \"Hey Bo Diddley\" as a gospel band played the legend\\'s music. A number of notable musicians sent flowers, including George Thorogood, Tom Petty and Jerry Lee Lewis. Little Richard, who had been asking his audiences to pray for Bo Diddley throughout his illness, had to fulfil concert commitments in Westbury and New York City the weekend of the funeral. He took time at both concerts to remember his friend of a half-century, performing Bo\\'s namesake tune in his honor.\\n\\nAfter the funeral service, a tribute concert was held at the Martin Luther King Center in Gainesville, Florida and featured guest performances by his son and daughter, Ellas McDaniel Jr. and Evelyn \"Tan\" Cooper; long-time background vocalist Gloria Jolivet; and Eric Burdon. In the days following his death, tributes were paid by then-President George W. Bush, the United States House of Representatives, and many musicians and performers, including B. B. King, Ronnie Hawkins, Mick Jagger, Ronnie Wood, George Thorogood, Eric Clapton, Tom Petty, Robert Plant, Elvis Costello, Bonnie Raitt, Robert Randolph and the Family Band and Eric Burdon.\\n\\nHe was posthumously awarded a Doctor of Fine Arts degree by the University of Florida for his influence on American popular music. In its People in America radio series, about influential people in American history, the Voice of America radio service paid tribute to him, describing how \"his influence was so widespread that it is hard to imagine what rock and roll would have sounded like without him.\" Mick Jagger stated that \"he was a wonderful, original musician who was an enormous force in music and was a big influence on the Rolling Stones. He was very generous to us in our early years and we learned a lot from him\". Jagger also praised the late star as a one-of-a-kind musician, adding, \"We will never see his like again\". The documentary film Cheat You Fair: The Story of Maxwell Street by director Phil Ranstrom features Bo Diddley\\'s last on-camera interview.\\n\\nIn November 2009, the guitar used by Bo Diddley in his final stage performance sold for $60,000 at auction.\\n\\nThe beneficiaries of his estate have been fighting in court for a forensic accounting of his assets, currently valued around $900,000, with as much as $6,000,000 unaccounted for.\\n\\nBo Diddley achieved numerous accolades in recognition of his significant role as one of the founding fathers of rock and roll:\\n\\n1986: Inducted into the Washington Area Music Association\\'s Hall of Fame.\\n1987: Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.\\n1990: Lifetime Achievement Award from Guitar Player magazine.\\n1998: Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation and the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.\\n1999: His 1955 recording of his song \"Bo Diddley\" inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame as a recording of lasting qualitative or historical significance.\\n2000: Inducted into the Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame and the North Florida Music Association\\'s Hall of Fame.\\n2002: Pioneer in Entertainment Award from the National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters\\n2002: Honored as one of the first BMI Icons at the 50th annual BMI Pop Awards, along with BMI affiliates Chuck Berry and Little Richard.\\n2008: Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree posthumously conferred on Diddley by the University of Florida in August (the award had been confirmed before his death in June).\\n2009: Announcement of his induction into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame (induction to occur during Florida Heritage Month, March 2010).\\n2010: Induction into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame.[citation needed]\\nIn 2003, U.S. Representative John Conyers paid tribute to Bo Diddley in the United States House of Representatives. describing him as \"one of the true pioneers of rock and roll, who has influenced generations\".\\nIn 2004, Mickey and Sylvia\\'s 1956 recording of \"Love Is Strange\" (a song first recorded by Bo Diddley but not released until a year before his death) was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame as a recording of qualitative or historical significance. Also in 2004, Bo Diddley was inducted into the Blues Foundation\\'s Blues Hall of Fame and was ranked number 20 on Rolling Stone magazine\\'s list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\\n\\nIn 2005, Bo Diddley celebrated his 50th anniversary in music with successful tours of Australia and Europe and with coast-to-coast shows across North America. He performed his song \"Bo Diddley\" with Eric Clapton and Robbie Robertson at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\\'s 20th annual induction ceremony. In the UK, Uncut magazine included his 1957 debut album, Bo Diddley, in its listing of the \\'100 Music, Movie & TV Moments That Have Changed the World\\'.\\n\\nBo Diddley was honored by the Mississippi Blues Commission with a Mississippi Blues Trail historic marker placed in McComb, his birthplace, in recognition of his enormous contribution to the development of the blues in Mississippi. On June 5, 2009, the city of Gainesville, Florida, officially renamed and dedicated its downtown plaza the Bo Diddley Community Plaza. The plaza was the site of a benefit concert at which Bo Diddley performed to raise awareness about the plight of the homeless in Alachua County and to raise money for local charities, including the Red Cross.\\n\\nThe 1988 video game Super Mario Bros. 3 featured a ghost-like enemy named Boo Diddley in homage to the legendary singer. In later games, the name was changed to Boo.\\n\\n\\nThe \"Bo Diddley beat\" is essentially the clave rhythm, one of the most common bell patterns found in sub-Saharan African music traditions. One scholar found this rhythm in 13 rhythm and blues recordings made in the years 1944–55, including two by Johnny Otis from 1948.\\n\\nBo Diddley gave different accounts of how he began to use this rhythm. Sublette asserts, \"In the context of the time, and especially those maracas (heard on the record), \\'Bo Diddley\\' has to be understood as a Latin-tinged record. A rejected cut recorded at the same session was titled only \\'Rhumba\\' on the track sheets.\" The Bo Diddley beat is similar to \"hambone\", a style used by street performers who play out the beat by slapping and patting their arms, legs, chest, and cheeks while chanting rhymes. Somewhat resembling the \"shave and a haircut, two bits\" rhythm, Diddley came across it while trying to play Gene Autry\\'s \"(I\\'ve Got Spurs That) Jingle, Jangle, Jingle\". Three years before his \"Bo Diddley\", a song with similar syncopation \"Hambone\", was cut by the Red Saunders Orchestra with the Hambone Kids. In 1944, \"Rum and Coca Cola\", containing the Bo Diddley beat, was recorded by the Andrews Sisters. Buddy Holly\\'s \"Not Fade Away\" (1957) and Them\\'s \"Mystic Eyes\" (1965) used the beat.\\n\\nIn its simplest form, the Bo Diddley beat can be counted out as either a one-bar or a two-bar phrase. Here is the count as a one-bar phrase: One e and ah, two e and ah, three e and ah, four e and ah (the boldface counts are the clave rhythm).\\n\\nMany songs (for example, \"Hey Bo Diddley\" and \"Who Do You Love?\") often have no chord changes; that is, the musicians play the same chord throughout the piece, so that the rhythms create the excitement, rather than having the excitement generated by harmonic tension and release. In his other recordings, Bo Diddley used various rhythms, from straight back beat to pop ballad style to doo-wop, frequently with maracas by Jerome Green.\\n\\nAn influential guitar player, Bo Diddley developed many special effects and other innovations in tone and attack. His trademark instrument was his self-designed, one-of-a-kind, rectangular-bodied \"Twang Machine\" (referred to as \"cigar-box shaped\" by music promoter Dick Clark) built by Gretsch. He had other uniquely shaped guitars custom-made for him by other manufacturers throughout the years, most notably the \"Cadillac\" and the rectangular \"Turbo 5-speed\" (with built-in envelope filter, flanger and delay) designs made by Tom Holmes (who also made guitars for ZZ Top\\'s Billy Gibbons, among others). In a 2005 interview on JJJ radio in Australia, he implied that the rectangular design sprang from an embarrassing moment. During an early gig, while jumping around on stage with a Gibson L5 guitar, he landed awkwardly, hurting his groin. He then went about designing a smaller, less restrictive guitar that allowed him to keep jumping around on stage while still playing his guitar. He also played the violin, which is featured on his mournful instrumental \"The Clock Strikes Twelve\", a twelve-bar blues.\\n\\nHe often created lyrics as witty and humorous adaptations of folk music themes. The song \"Bo Diddley\" was based on the African-American clapping rhyme \"Hambone\" (which in turn was based on the lullaby \"Hush Little Baby\"). Likewise, \"Hey Bo Diddley\" is based on the song \"Old MacDonald\". The song \"Who Do You Love?\" with its rap-style boasting, and his use of the African-American game known as \"the dozens\" on the songs \"Say Man\" and \"Say Man, Back Again,\" are cited as progenitors of hip-hop music (for example, \"You got the nerve to call somebody ugly. Why, you so ugly, the stork that brought you into the world ought to be arrested\").\\nThe Bo Diddley Beat is a kind of syncopated five-accent clave rhythm. The Bo Diddley beat is named after Bo Diddley, who introduced and popularised the beat with his self-titled debut single. Although Bo Diddley was a rhythm and blues musician essentially, the beat is widely used in rock and roll and pop music.\\n\\nThe \"Bo Diddley Beat\" (1955) is perhaps the first true fusion of 3-2 clave and R&B/rock \\'n\\' roll.\\nThe Bo Diddley beat is essentially a 3-2 clave rhythm, one of the most common bell patterns found in Afro-Cuban music, and its origin goes back to the sub-Saharan African music traditions. But there is no documentation of a direct Cuban connection to Bo Diddley\\'s adaptation of the clave rhythm. The Latin connection was so strong that Bo Diddley used maracas as a basic component of his sound. Bo Diddley has given different accounts regarding how he began to use this rhythm. In an interview with Rolling Stones magazine, Diddley said he came up with the beat after listening to Gospel music in church when he was 12 years old.\\nSublette asserts: \"In the context of the time, and especially those maracas (heard on the record), \\'Bo Diddley\\' has to be understood as a Latin-tinged record. A rejected cut recorded at the same session was titled only \\'Rhumba\\' on the track sheets.\" Somewhat resembling the Shave and a Haircut rhythm, Diddley came across it while trying to play Gene Autry\\'s version of \"Jingle, Jangle, Jingle\".\\n\\nAccording to ethnomusicologists, the Bo Diddley beat is similar to a folk tradition called \"hambone\", a style used by street performers who play out the beat by slapping and patting their arms, legs, chest, and cheeks while chanting rhymes. \"Handboning\" can also be described as a form of corpophone - using your body for percussion. This is something that\\'s inherent in African-American culture. You don\\'t have a drum? Your body is the next best thing. You clap, slap and stomp. Corpophone excludes the voice and the introduction of the neologism as a classificatory category was added to the conventional scheme of idiophone, membranophone, chordophone, aerophone, and electrophone by the American ethnomusicologist Dale A. Olsen. The Bo Diddley beat is also akin to the age-old rhythmic pattern best known as \"shave and a haircut, two bits.\" And it\\'s been linked to Yoruba drumming from West Africa.\\n\\nIn its simplest form, the Bo Diddley beat can be counted out as either a one-bar, or a two-bar phrase. Here is the count as a one-bar phrase: One e and ah, two e and ah, three e and ah, four e and ah. The bolded counts are the clave rhythm.\\n\\nThree years before Bo\\'s \"Bo Diddley\" (1955), a song similar syncopation \"Hambone\", was cut by Red Saunders\\' Orchestra with The Hambone Kids. In 1944, \"Rum and Coca Cola\", containing the Bo Diddley beat, was recorded by The Andrews Sisters and later Buddy Holly\\'s \"Not Fade Away\" (1957) and Them\\'s \"Mystic Eyes\" (1965) used the beat. This rhythm occurs in 13 rhythm and blues recordings made in the years 1944–55, including two by Johnny Otis from 1948.\\n\\nUnfortunately, while Bo\\'s sound was his trademark, he couldn’t copyright it, which may explain why Diddley has been overlooked and undervalued, even though his sound snakes through a hit list spanning two generations. Cover bands play the Bo Diddley beat formulaically but in Bo Diddley\\'s hands, the beat was alive. He did something different with it every time he recorded it. It\\'s the difference between copying and creating.\\n\\nOther songs employing the Bo Diddley beat include \"I Wish You Would\" by Billy Boy Arnold (1955), \"Willie and the Hand Jive\" by Johnny Otis (1958), \"(Marie\\'s the Name) His Latest Flame\" (1961) by Elvis Presley, \"When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes\" by The Supremes (1963), \"I Want Candy\" by The Strangeloves (1965), \"Please Go Home\" by The Rolling Stones (1966), \"Magic Bus\" (1968) by The Who, \"1969\" (1969) by The Stooges, \"She Has Funny Cars\" (1969) by Jefferson Airplane, Suzanne (1968/9) by Fairport Convention, \"Panic in Detroit\" (1973) by David Bowie, \"Shame, Shame, Shame\" by Shirley & Company (1974), \"She\\'s the One\" (1975) by Bruce Springsteen, \"American Girl\" (1977) by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, \"Rudie Can\\'t Fail\" (1979) by The Clash, \"Deathwish\" by The Police (1979), \"Cuban Slide\" by The Pretenders (1980),[6] \"I Want Candy\" (cover) by Bow Wow Wow (1982), \"Freeze to Me\" (1983) by David Wilcox, \"Mr. Brownstone\" (1987) by Guns N\\' Roses, \"Faith\" (1987) by George Michael, \"Desire\" (1988) by U2, \"Movin\\' on Up\" (1991) by Primal Scream, \"Woodcutter\\'s Son\" (1995) by Paul Weller, \"Doctor Looney\\'s Remedy\" by Parachute Express (1995), \"Caress Me Down\" by Sublime (1996), \"Cannon Ball\" by Duane Eddy (1996), \"Screwdriver\" (1999) by The White Stripes, \"I\\'m Sorry I Love You\" by The Magnetic Fields, and \"The Big 5-0\" (2004) by Stan Ridgway. \"Party at the Leper Colony\" (2003) by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic is a comedy song featuring the Bo Diddley beat.\\nMore subtle uses of the Diddley beat include \"Hateful\" (1979) by The Clash and \"How Soon Is Now?\" (1985) by The Smiths.\\n\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bo+Diddley\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His first album, \"Deep In The Heart Of Nowhere\" (released in 1986) was probably his most commercial, and it yielded a minor hit with the song \"This Is The World Calling\".\\n\\nThe next album \"The Vegetarians of Love\" was probably his most successful though, blending elements of traditional Irish music with great rock and pop. Songs like \"Love or Something\" and \"The Great Song of Indifference\" are all fun, upbeat songs.\\n\\nBob\\'s third album was \"The Happy Club\", which continued the feeling of The Vegetarians of Love. Once again there are some great songs here - \"Attitude Chicken\" has some brilliantly clever lyrics, while \"The Soft Soil\" is beautiful and \"A Sex Thing\" has an awesome groove.\\n\\nAfter this album, a best of called \"Loudmouth\" was released, which included some highlights from the careers of both Bob solo and The Boomtown Rats. It also included a new song - \"Crazy\", which was a duet with Sting.\\n\\nBob then took a long sabbatical from music before releasing \"Sex, Age & Death\" in 2001.

       " 'Bob James (born December 25, 1939) is a two-time Grammy Award-winning jazz keyboardist.\\n\\nThough he has recorded a couple of straight jazz albums, most of his recordings contain \"pop-jazz\" which is a type of instrumental pop music. Bob James was an important figure in turning 1970s fusion jazz more commercial. For their album One on One, Earl Klugh and Bob James received a Grammy award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance of 1981.\\n\\n\"Angela\", the instrumental theme from the sitcom Taxi, is probably Bob James\\' most well-known work to date. \\nWith his song \"Take Me To The Mardi Gras\", Bob James secured his place in hip-hop history when the song was sampled by Run-DMC in their song \"Peter Piper\" from the Raising Hell release. \"Take Me To The Mardi Gras\" has been sampled in numerous hip-hop songs since \"Peter Piper\", including Eric B. & Rakim\\'s \"Don\\'t Sweat The Technique\", the Beastie Boys\\' \"Hold It Now, Hit It\", and by Timbaland, in Missy Elliot\\'s \"Work It\". \\nAnother song by Bob James that has also been frequently sampled by the hip-hop and electronic music community is \"Nautilus\", being sampled by artists such as DJ Premier, Pete Rock, A Tribe Called Quest, DJ Cam and Luke Vibert, and Ghostface Killah. Nautilus has been covered by current touring acts as diverse as Greyboy Allstars and Sound Tribe Sector 9.  \\n\\nBob James\\' recordings have practically defined pop/jazz and crossover during the past few decades. Very influenced by pop and movie music, James has often featured R&B-ish soloists (most notably Grover Washington Jr.), who add a jazz touch to what is essentially an instrumental pop set. He actually started out in music going with a much different direction. \\nIn 1962, Bob James recorded a bop-ish trio set for Mercury, and three years later his album for ESP was quite avant-garde, with electronic tapes used for effects. After a period with Sarah Vaughan (1965-1968), he became a studio musician, and by 1973 was arranging and working as a producer for CTI. \\nIn 1974, James recorded his first purely commercial effort as a leader; he later made big-selling albums for his own Tappan Zee label, Columbia, and Warner Bros., including collborations with Earl Klugh (Cool, One on One) and David Sanborn (Double Vision). Listeners who prefer challenging jazz to background dance music will be consistently disappointed by Bob James\\' post-1965 albums.\\nJames is a member of smooth jazz supergroup Fourplay and is a Yamaha Artist. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bob+James\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

After the Grateful Dead disbanded, Weir performed with The Other Ones, later known as The Dead, together with other former members of the Grateful Dead. Weir also founded and played in several other bands during and after his career with the Grateful Dead, including Kingfish, the Bob Weir Band, Bobby and the Midnites, and his current band, RatDog.\\n\\nWeir played mostly rhythm guitar during his career with the Grateful Dead. He is known for his unique style of complex voiceleading, bringing unusual depth and a new approach to the role of rhythm guitar expression.\\n\\nWeir was born in San Francisco, California and raised by his adoptive parents in the suburb of Atherton. He began playing guitar at age thirteen after less successful experimentation with the piano and the trumpet. He had trouble in school because of undiagnosed dyslexia and he was expelled from nearly every school he attended.  One of these was the Fountain Valley School in Colorado, where he befriended John Perry Barlow, who, along with Robert Hunter, would in time become the two main lyricists for the Grateful Dead.\\n\\nWeir played rhythm guitar and sang a portion of the lead vocals through all of the Dead\\'s 30-year career. (In the fall of 1968, the Dead played some concerts without Weir and Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan. These shows, with the band billed as \"Mickey and the Hartbeats\", were intermixed with full-lineup Grateful Dead concerts. Late in the year, the band relented and took Weir and Pigpen back in full time.) In the late 1970s, he began to experiment with slide guitar techniques and perform certain songs during Dead shows using the slide. His unique guitar style is strongly influenced by the hard bop pianist McCoy Tyner and he has cited artists as diverse as John Coltrane, the Rev. Gary Davis, and Igor Stravinsky as influences\\n\\nShortly before Garcia\\'s death in 1995, Weir formed another band, Ratdog Revue, later shortened to Ratdog. As of April 9, 2008, Weir has performed approximately 800 shows with Ratdog. Known for his raspy, deep tone, in Ratdog Weir sings covers by The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Chuck Berry, and Willie Dixon while also performing many Grateful Dead classics. In addition, Ratdog performs many of their own originals, most of which were released on the album Evening Moods.\\n\\nWeir has also participated in the various reformations of the Grateful Dead\\'s members, including 1998, 2000 and 2002 stints as The Other Ones and in 2003 and 2004 as The Dead.\\n\\nDespite breaking his ribs in a tour bus accident in early October 2008, described in media outlets that \"It only hurts when I breathe, laugh, or hold a guitar,\" Weir is expected to perform with the remaining members of the Grateful Dead (Lesh, Kreutzmann, and Hart) with Jeff Chimenti (Ratdog) on Keyboards and Warren Haynes (Gov\\'t Mule, Allman Brothers) on Lead Guitar and Vocals, on October 13, 2008, in a get out the vote Concert for Change at Penn State University. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Weir\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Bobbie Gentry (born July 27, 1942) is an American singer-songwriter. She was born Roberta Lee Streeter to Portuguese parents in Chickasaw County, Mississippi. She shot to international fame in the summer of 1967 with the quirky and intriguing Ode to Billie Joe, written by Gentry and sung in her warm, captivating style. \"Ode\" was listed as the most popular single of the year in many U.S. record surveys and was admired by Frank Sinatra and other singers.\\n\\nEarly years\\n\\nGentry spent her childhood living with her father in Greenwood, Mississippi, where she attended elementary school and began teaching herself to play the guitar, the bass guitar, and the banjo. In her early teens, she moved to Palm Springs, California, to live with her mother, Ruby Bullington Streeter, graduating from Palm Springs High School in 1962. It was during this time that the teenage Roberta settled on the stage name \"Bobbie Gentry,\" and began performing at local country clubs, encouraged by no less a Palm Springs celebrity than Bob Hope.\\n\\nAfter a short career as a Las Vegas showgirl, Gentry moved to Los Angeles, attended UCLA (where she was a philosophy major) and worked clerical jobs while occasionally performing in local nightclubs. She later transferred to the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music to hone her composition and performing skills.\\n\\nRise to fame\\n\\nIn 1967, Gentry recorded a demo and submitted it to Capitol Records executive Kelly Gordon, who quickly signed her to a recording contract and produced her first album. A 45 rpm \"single\" of two of her songs—\"Mississippi Delta\" and \"Ode to Billie Joe\"—was the first issue from this first effort, and even though \"Mississippi Delta\" was chosen for the \"A\" side, radio stations were quickly enamored with the quirky tale of Billie Joe McAllister and the mystery of his fate, as hauntingly performed and recorded on the \"B\" side. Bobbie Gentry had a monster hit on her hands, and Capitol Records had its newest superstar. Gentry went on to win three Grammy Awards that year, including \"Best Vocal Performance by a Female\", and \"Best New Artist.\"\\n\\nGentry\\'s follow-up albums, The Delta Sweete and Local Gentry, both produced by Gordon, were issued in 1968. Though critically acclaimed, neither album garnered the kinds of sales figures that were realized with Gentry\\'s debut effort. The year 1968 also saw the release of an album of duets that paired Gentry with fellow Capitol alumnus Glen Campbell. Gentry and Campbell\\'s harmonies resulted in a gold record and three hit singles, including a cover of the Everly Brothers hit \"All I Have to Do Is Dream\", which rose to No. 6 on the country charts in the winter of 1969.\\n\\nGentry toured briefly with Campbell and performed on a number of U.S. television programs and specials in the late 1960s. Her other notable singles include Doug Kershaw\\'s composition \"Louisiana Man\" as well as a mellow version of a Burt Bacharach-Hal David song, \"I\\'ll Never Fall in Love Again\". The latter went to No. 1 in Great Britain in 1970, a year after Dionne Warwick had a hit with it in the United States. 1970 also saw the release of another U.S. hit with the self-penned \"Fancy,\" which rose to No. 26 on the Country chart and 31 on the Pop chart. (This enduring tale would later be covered with major success by Reba McEntire in 1991.)\\n\\nGentry would go on to record three more albums, while having earlier albums reissued under different titles. These last three albums, Touch \\'Em with Love, Fancy, and the ambitious and highly regarded Patchwork, which consisted of all original material, were greeted enthusiastically by critics but, with the exception of the aforementioned title track to Fancy, failed to resonate with the public (though Gentry did generate a significant fan base in the United Kingdom).\\n\\nUndaunted by declining record sales, Gentry sought other outlets for her creativity. She continued to write and perform, touring Europe and headlining a Las Vegas review in which she produced, choreographed, and wrote and arranged the music. In 1974, Gentry hosted a short-lived summer replacement variety show, The Bobbie Gentry Happiness Hour on CBS. The show, which served as her own version of Campbell\\'s hit series The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour, also on CBS, was not picked up for a full season. That same year, Gentry wrote and performed \"Another Place, Another Time\" for writer-director (and Beverly Hillbillies actor) Max Baer, Jr.\\'s film, Macon County Line. Baer would go on to direct a feature film take on Ode To Billy Joe, starring Robbie Benson, in which the mystery of Billie Joe\\'s suicide is revealed as a part of the conflict between his love for Bobbie Lee Hartley and his emerging homosexuality.\\n\\nBy the middle 1970s, Gentry\\'s sellability had waned significantly, and Capitol did not renew her contract. After some behind-the-scenes work in television production failed to hold her interests, Gentry decided to retire from show business. Her last public appearance as a performer was on Christmas night 1978, as a guest on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. She has deliberately remained out of the limelight ever since.\\n\\nPersonal life\\n\\nShe was married twice. The first, to casino magnate William F. Harrah in 1969, when she was 27 and he was 58, lasted only three months, a victim of her fame. The second, to novelty singer-songwriter Jim Stafford, ended in 1979, after only eleven months of marriage and the birth of a son, Tyler. The details of Gentry\\'s personal life after her retirement are little known, but it is generally believed that she has settled into a happy life, and enjoys being a private citizen, unhindered by the scrutiny that fame brings. As of January 2003, she was living in Los Angeles County, California. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bobbie+Gentry\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Bobby \"Blue\" Bland (Robert Calvin Brooks, January 27, 1930 – June 23, 2013) was an American rhythm & blues singer. Bland\\'s craft was most clearly heard on a series of early 1960s releases, including \"Cry Cry Cry\", \"I Pity the Fool\" (number 1 on the R&B chart in 1961) and \"Turn On Your Love Light\", all included on the 1961 album  \"Two Steps From The Blues\".\\n\\nBobby Bland developed a sound that mixed gospel with the blues and R&B. Bland was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1981, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, and the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2012. He received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame described him as \"second in stature only to B.B. King as a product of Memphis\\'s Beale Street blues scene\".\\nHe was sometimes referred to as the \"Lion of the Blues\" and as the \"Sinatra of the Blues\". His music was also influenced by Nat King Cole.\\n\\nBland was born Robert Calvin Brooks in the small town of Barretville, Tennessee. His father, I.J. Brooks, abandoned the family not long after Robert\\'s birth. Robert later acquired the name \"Bland\" from his stepfather, Leroy Bridgeforth, who was also called Leroy Bland. Robert dropped out of school in third grade to work in the cotton fields and never graduated from school.\\n\\nWith his mother, Bland moved to Memphis in 1947, where he started singing with local gospel groups, including the Miniatures. Eager to expand his interests, he began frequenting the city\\'s famous Beale Street, where he became associated with an ad hoc circle of aspiring musicians including B.B. King, Rosco Gordon, Junior Parker and Johnny Ace, who collectively called themselves the Beale Streeters.\\n\\nBetween 1950 and 1952, Bland recorded commercially unsuccessful singles for Modern Records and, at Ike Turner\\'s suggestion, for Sun Records (which licensed its recordings to Chess Records). He then signed a contract with Duke Records. Bland\\'s recordings from the early 1950s show him striving for individuality, but his progress was halted for two years while he served in the U.S. Army, during which time he performed in a band with the singer Eddie Fisher.\\n\\nWhen Bland returned to Memphis in 1954, several of his former associates, including Johnny Ace, were enjoying considerable success. He joined Ace\\'s revue and returned to Duke Records, which was then being run by the Houston entrepreneur Don Robey. According to his biographer Charles Farley, \"Robey handed Bobby a new contract, which Bobby could not read, and helped Bobby sign his name on it\". The contract gave Bland just half a cent per record sold, instead of the industry standard of 2 cents.\\n\\nBland released his first single for Duke in 1955. In 1956 he began touring on the chitlin\\' circuit with Junior Parker in a revue called Blues Consolidated, initially doubling as Parker\\'s valet and driver. He began recording for Duke with the bandleader Bill Harvey and the arranger Joe Scott, asserting his characteristic vocal style and, with Harvey and Scott, beginning to craft the melodic big-band blues singles for which he became famous, often accompanied by the guitarist Wayne Bennett. Unlike many blues musicians, Bland played no instrument.\\n\\nBland\\'s first chart success came in 1957 with \"Farther Up the Road\", which reached number 1 on the R&B chart and number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was followed by a series of hits on the R&B chart, including \"Little Boy Blue\" (1958). He also recorded an album with Parker, Blues Consolidated, in 1958. Bland\\'s craft was most clearly heard on a series of early-1960s releases, including \"Cry Cry Cry\", \"I Pity the Fool\" (number 1 on the R&B chart in 1961) and \"Turn On Your Love Light\", which became a much-covered standard by the Grateful Dead and other bands. Despite credits to the contrary—often claimed by Robey—many of these classic works were written by Joe Scott. Bland also recorded a hit version of T-Bone Walker\\'s \"Call It Stormy Monday (But Tuesday Is Just as Bad)\", which was erroneously given the title of a different song, \"Stormy Monday Blues\".\\n\\nHis last record to reach number 1 on the R&B chart was \"That\\'s the Way Love Is\", in 1963, but he continued to produce a consistent run of R&B chart entries through the mid-1960s. He barely broke into the mainstream market; his highest-charting song on the pop chart, \"Ain\\'t Nothing You Can Do\", peaked at number 20 in 1964, in the same week in which the Beatles held down the top five spots. Bland\\'s records mostly sold on the R&B market rather than achieving crossover success. He had 23 Top Ten hits on the Billboard R&B chart. In the book Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942–1995, by Joel Whitburn, Bland was ranked number 13 of the all-time top-charting artists.\\n\\nFinancial pressures forced the singer to cut his touring band and in 1968 the group broke up. He suffered from depression and became increasingly dependent on alcohol, but he stopped drinking in 1971. His record company, Duke Records, was sold to the larger ABC Records group. This resulted in several successful and critically acclaimed contemporary blues and soul albums including His California Album and Dreamer, arranged by Michael Omartian and produced by ABC staffer Steve Barri. The albums, including the later \"follow-up\" in 1977, Reflections in Blue, were recorded in Los Angeles and featured many of the city\\'s top session musicians at the time.\\n\\nThe first single released from His California Album, \"This Time I\\'m Gone for Good\" took Bland back into the pop Top 50 for the first time since 1964 and made the R&B top 10 in late 1973. The opening track from Dreamer, \"Ain\\'t No Love in the Heart of the City\", was a strong R&B hit. A version of it was released in 1978 by the hard-rock band Whitesnake, featuring the singer David Coverdale. Much later it was sampled by Kanye West on Jay-Z\\'s hip-hop album The Blueprint (2001). The song is also featured on the soundtrack of the crime drama The Lincoln Lawyer (2011), starring Matthew McConaughey. The follow-up, \"I Wouldn\\'t Treat a Dog\" was his biggest R&B hit for some years, climbing to number 3 in late 1974, but as usual his strength was never the pop chart (on which it reached number 88). Subsequent attempts at adding a disco flavor were mostly unsuccessful. A return to his roots in 1980 for a tribute album to his mentor Joe Scott, produced by music veterans Monk Higgins and Al Bell, resulted in the album Sweet Vibrations, but it failed to sell well outside of his traditional \"chitlin circuit\" base.\\n\\nIn 1985, Bland signed a contract with Malaco Records, specialists in traditional Southern black music, for which he made a series of albums while continuing to tour and appear at concerts with B. B. King. The two had collaborated on two albums in the 1970s. Despite occasional age-related ill health, Bland continued to record new albums for Malaco and perform occasional tours alone, with the guitarist and producer Angelo Earl and also with B. B. King, and performed at blues and soul festivals worldwide. In 1985, the album Members Only on Malaco reached number 45 on Billboard\\'s R&B albums chart, and the title song reached number 54 for R&B singles. It was his last chart single, and became Bland\\'s signature song for the rest of his career. Bland was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame described him as \"second in stature only to B. B. King as a product of Memphis\\'s Beale Street blues scene\".\\n\\nThe Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison was an early adherent of Bland, covering \"Turn On Your Love Light\" while with the band Them (he later covered \"Ain\\'t Nothing You Can\\'t Do\" on his 1974 live album It\\'s Too Late to Stop Now), and Bland was an occasional guest singer at Morrison\\'s concerts. He also included a previously unreleased version of a March 2000 duet of Morrison and Bland singing \"Tupelo Honey\" on his 2007 compilation album, The Best of Van Morrison Volume 3.\\n\\nIn 2008 the British singer and lead vocalist of Simply Red, Mick Hucknall, released the album Tribute to Bobby, containing songs associated with Bland. The album reached 18 in the UK Albums Chart.\\n\\nBland continued performing until shortly before his death. \\nHe died on June 23, 2013, at his home in Germantown, Tennessee, a suburb of Memphis, after what family members described as \"an ongoing illness\". He was 83. \\n\\nHe was described as \"among the great storytellers of blues and soul music... who created tempestuous arias of love, betrayal and resignation, set against roiling, dramatic orchestrations, and left the listener drained but awed.\"\\n\\nAfter his death, his son Rodd told news media that Bland had recently told him that the blues musician James Cotton was Bland\\'s half-brother. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bobby+%22Blue%22+Bland\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Bobby Bare (born Robert Joseph Bare on April 7, 1935 in Ironton, Ohio) is an American country music singer and songwriter.\\n\\nIn the fifties after many failed attempts to sell his songs, he finally was signed up with Capitol Records and recorded a few rock and roll songs without much chart success. Just before he was drafted into the Army, he wrote a song called \\'The All American Boy\\' and did a demo for his friend, Bill Parsons, to learn and record it. Instead of using the version Bill Parsons did later, the record company, Fraternity Records, decided to use the original demo done by Bobby Bare. The record reached number 2 on the Billboard Top 100, but it was wrongly credited to Bill Parsons.\\n\\nHis real big break came when RCA boss and guitarist Chet Atkins signed him to the RCA label. The first song he released on this label, \\'Shame On Me\\', sold nearly a million copies and pushed Bobby Bare to fame overnight. His second RCA release, \\'Detroit City\\' won him a Grammy for the best song of the year. Then a surge of hits followed, including \\'500 Miles Away From Home\\', \\'Four Strong Winds\\' and others. He has also recorded two very successful albums with Skeeter Davis and has also dueted with Lacy J. Dalton and Rosanne Cash and additionally had a major hit as part of a trio with Norma Jean (singer) and Liz Anderson in 1967 titled \\'The Game of Triangles\\'.\\n\\nHe moved to Mercury label in 1970 and had two big hits from early Kris Kristofferson compositions, \\'Come Sundown\\' and \\'Please Don\\'t Tell Me How The Story Ends\\' before returning to RCA label where he produced his own records. Later Bare moved to CBS label and in 1979, he helped establish Rosanne Cash\\'s career by singing with her on \"No Memories Hangin\\' Round\". Bare\\'s singles for Columbia Records included \\'The Jogger\\', \\'Tequila Sheila\\', \\'Gotta Get Rid Of This Band\\', \\'When Hippies Get Older\\' and \\'Numbers\\'. He later recorded for EMI with little success.\\n\\nBobby Bare is a versatile singer, and in the 70s started to release novelty songs recorded live with selected audiences. One of such songs, \\'Marie Laveau\\' about a witch, reached the number one position on the country chart. This song was written by his friend, a very talented song writer, poet, author and cartoonist Shel Silverstein. He also penned many other songs for Bobby Bare including a Grammy nominated hit called \\'Daddy What If\\' which he recorded with his five year old son, Bobby Bare Jr, who later became a star on his own. Bobby Bare later recorded a very successful album with his family and penned mainly by Shel called \\'Singing in The Kitchen\\'. It was nominated for best group category in Grammy Awards but was declined by Bobby himself.\\n\\nHe later took chances recording strange, controversial material as \\'Dropkick Me Jesus (Through The Goalposts Of Life)\\' (a 1976 Grammy nominee) and the expletive-driven \\'Redneck Hippie Romance\\' with much success.\\n\\nBobby Bare is also the first to come up with a concept album called \\'Bird Named Yesterday\\' which was very successful. His most successful concept album is \\'Lullaby Legends and Lies\\'. \\n\\nBobby Bare was also given an opportunity to star in the movies. He did a Western with Troy Donahue called A Distant Trumpet, and a few episodes of a TV series called No Time for Sergeants. He turned his back on Hollywood to pursue his career in Country Music.\\n\\nIn 1998 he formed the band Old Dogs together with his friends Jerry Reed, Mel Tillis and Waylon Jennings.\\n\\nIn addition to the above, Bobby Bare is credited for introducing Waylon Jennings to RCA. He is also one of the first to record from many well known song writers such as Jack Clement, Harlan Howard, Billy Joe Shaver, Mickey Newberry, Tom T. Hall, Kris Kristofferson, and many others. He later had a TV series called \\'Bobby Bare & Friends, A Song Writer Showcase\\'. Recently, he has recorded a new album after over 20 years called \\'The Moon Was Blue\\' produced by his son.

He is known best for being a one-hit wonder with the 1970 song \"Montego Bay,\" which was co-written and produced by Jeff Barry. \\n\\nIn the early 1960s, Bloom had been a member of the doo-wop group, The Imaginations. He received a big break in 1969 when he was awarded a contract to write and record a jingle for Pepsi, paving the way for his later success with \"Montego Bay.\" He also played a role as a songwriter for the Kama Sutra/Buddah group of labels, co-writing \"Mony Mony\" for Tommy James and the Shondells and, with Jeff Barry, \"Sunshine\" for The Archies.\\nBloom worked as a sound engineer for musicians such as Louis Jordan and Shuggie Otis.

       " 'Amidst a wave of self-made songwriters, artists and producers, Oakland, California’s Bobby Brackins is at the crest. With over 25 million YouTube plays, and international radio spins, the established soloist who has written a litany of artists including Chris Brown, Nicki Minaj, Zendaya, Trey Songz, Dev, Jeremih, and Tinashe, is finally coming into his own as a soloist with a sharp pen and easygoing charm.\\n \\nGrowing up in the diverse streets of East Oakland, Bobby immersed himself in a variety of cultures, styles, and attitudes. Bringing that vast influence to his arts, Brackins graduated a local Pop star, hearing himself on radio the night of his senior prom. . “We were all getting back in the limo, and the song played, with our dates all that. It was pretty dope,” recalls the artist, who hasn’t slowed down eight years later. Following his Go Dav cut, “Ride Or Die Chick,” it only grew. “After that, everybody in the Bay area pretty much knew me, and that I made music. I’ve been pretty popular ever since.”\\n\\nFollowing high school, Brackins relocated to Los Angeles alongside his producer and close friend, Nic Nac. “I wanted to keep making music with Nic, and I knew that L.A. was more industry-based. That’s where the labels and well-connected managers were.” There, he embedded himself in a hungry musical community that included friends and collaborators such as YG, Ty Dolla $ign, ScHoolboy Q, and DJ Mustard in addition to hit-making vets, Chris Brown and Ray J. Although he was in the land of the stars, the artist with the government name used the Internet to build a base. With a strong female following, Brackins says, “I took advantage of the web, learning how to market and brand myself, and grow more popular.” With impressive numbers on his singles and videos, the “143”-maker continued to work, and fuse sonic styles. “Besides legends like E-40 and Too Short, there weren’t many artists from my generation who were from the Bay, working with L.A. talent. So I put it on myself, I built the bridge, for this generation.” Co-headlining his first tour with YG, and closely working with Los Angeles’ new musical guard, Bobby Brackins has touched many facets of the Southern Cali sound, despite his Bay area roots.\\n\\nEven with his viral success, Brackins is patient with his brand and timing. “We live in a singles-driven market; it’s not 1990 anymore,” he jokes, regarding his yet-released debut. “Singles can go platinum and gold, and albums can come out and sell 10,000 copies. I’ve seen it many times. If it gets to the point where you feel like an album necessary and needed, it’ll be done.” Looking at YG’s success as well as fellow writers-turned-artists like The-Dream and Ty$, the twenty-something has no issue waiting for on a proper offering, despite eight mixtapes in as many years, including 2013’s Maxwell Park. Until the fan-base is there, where I can do shows across the country, filling up 5,000-plus-seat venues, that’s when I’ll drop an album,” he admits.\\n\\nUntil then, Bobby has plenty of work. The writer and producer revealed that Rihanna’s camp recently solicited some of his hit-making abilities. “I don’t ever shop records. One of my friends might play it for somebody, or more often, the artists are coming to the studio to witness the whole creative process, from scratch.” Locked in the lab, it’s dutifully plugging away that’s led to Bobby penning and co-producing a #1 record for Chris Brown in “Loyal,” as well as helping Tinashe find the traction necessary to earn a major label album release date with her lead single, “2 On.” “People are seeing my name more and more, and they’re giving me a lil’ more credit. I’m excited about dropping my own music, and giving people awareness that I’ve helped mold the new West Coast sound.” The credit is there, is as the chart and viral reaction, assuring the world that Bobby Brackins has his pen, production, and artistry on the pulse of the people.\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bobby+Brackins\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Bobby Brown is an American singer and rapper. Brown, alongside frequent collaborator Teddy Riley, is noted as one of the pioneers of new jack swing: a fusion of hip hop and R&B. Brown started his career in the R&B and pop group New Edition, from its inception in 1981 until his exit from the group in December 1985.\\n\\nOnce he started a solo career, Brown enjoyed commercial and critical success with his second album Don\\'t Be Cruel (1988) which spawned five Billboard Hot 100 top 10 singles, including the number one hit \"My Prerogative\", and the Grammy Award-winning \"Every Little Step\". In 1989, Brown contributed two songs to the soundtrack of Ghostbusters II. In 1992, Brown married superstar singer Whitney Houston, with whom he later had a daughter named Bobbi Kristina Brown. The couple\\'s drug issues and domestic disputes made them tabloid fodder.\\n\\nBrown\\'s next album Bobby (1992) spawned several singles including \"Humpin\\' Around\", \"Get Away\", and \"Good Enough\", however, sales of Bobby did not reach the level of its predecessor.\\n\\nBrown also appeared in the films A Thin Line Between Love and Hate and Two Can Play That Game. He returned to New Edition for a reunion album and tour from 1996 to 1997, and returned with all six members for another stint in 2005.

       " 'Bobby Caldwell (August 15, 1951 – March 14, 2023) was an American singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who, despite a prolific musical output over his 30-year career, was still best known for his 1978 hit single \"What You Won\\'t Do for Love.\" While he has always maintained a devoted fan base in the United States, a more legendary status has been bestowed upon him in Japan.\\n\\nEarly life\\n\\nBobby Caldwell was born in Manhattan to Bob and Carolyn Franklin, the hosts of Suppertime, an early television variety show. Living in Memphis and, chiefly, Miami (which he has called an influential \"dumping ground\" for all kinds of music), he took up piano and guitar as a preteen. Forming his own band at 17, he took the group on the road, later recording an album entitled Kathmandu.\\n\\nCaldwell\\'s first performances were more rock-oriented than the bulk of his career would indicate; early dates had him playing Jimi Hendrix and Cream covers in small clubs.\\n\\n[edit] Recording career\\n\\n[edit] Bobby Caldwell (What You Won\\'t Do for Love)\\n\\nBobby Caldwell was signed to legendary Miami label TK Records, home to many different kinds of musical acts: the pop-disco of KC & The Sunshine Band, the Latin-flavoured funk of Foxy, the down-home soul of George McCrae and his wife Gwen McCrae, and the futuristic, jazzy disco of Peter Brown and T-Connection.\\n\\nFor this very hot label, Bobby recorded his double platinum-attaining self-titled solo album, scoring hits with the singles \"What You Won\\'t Do for Love\", \"My Flame\" and, in Britain, \"Down for the Third Time.\" In order to ensure significant airplay on the African American-dominated R&B radio format of the time, Caldwell\\'s management took certain steps — such as portraying the artist only in silhouette on the cover and in advertisements — to hide the fact that he was white. The secret was, for obvious reasons, shattered by his first live appearances.\\n\\nAfter the tracks were first recorded and the record was considered \"complete,\" TK owner Henry Stone said that he enjoyed the album but couldn\\'t hear a hit. Attempting to address this issue, Caldwell and his band re-entered the studio, laying down the song\\'s now-familiar rhythm tracks. After he quickly penned a set of lyrics, \"What You Won\\'t Do for Love\" was born.\\n\"What You Won\\'t Do for Love\" in its novelty vinyl incarnation\\n\\nReaching the top ten on both the pop (#9) and R&B (#6) charts, the song proved to be a success, though a bit of a surprise one due both to the haste with which it was written and the fact that Caldwell assumed \"My Flame\", the LP\\'s second track (\"What You Won\\'t Do for Love\" is the sixth), would wind up as the standout single. The album which contained it was later re-released under the song\\'s title. The single was also marketed in the form of a distinctive red heart-shaped 45-RPM vinyl record (advertised as \"the single that gets to the heart of the matter\"), now a collector\\'s item frequently seen on eBay. Although the record is heart-shaped, the grooves on the vinyl, of course, are round, even though the sleeve would lead one to think otherwise. (The What You Won\\'t Do for Love album also received a novelty release on yellow vinyl.)\\n\\nWhile the original song still receives frequent airplay today, it has been covered, re-made (once, in 1998, by Caldwell himself) and sampled many times since 1978. Phyllis Hyman for her Living All Alone album, Go West\\'s version rose high in the adult contemporary charts, and Boyz II Men\\'s version in 2004, Tupac Shakur\\'s \"Do for Love,\" which samples the lyric, also attained a good deal of popularity. Goldie covered it on his 1998 EP Ring of Saturn (the lyrics were sung by Diane Charlemagne), In 2007 it was given a funky house makeover by Central Avenue featuring Simon Green. In addition, \"My Flame\" was covered by actress/singer Vanessa Williams for her 1999 Greatest Hits CD and also sampled by Bad-Boy recording artist The Notorious B.I.G. and integrated into the song Sky\\'s the Limit; which was also another major Rap/Hip-Hop hit.Another version is to notice from Ricky Peterson in the 90\\'s.\\n\\nThe Cat in the Hat through August Moon\\n\\nCaldwell\\'s sophomore period involved the considerable task of following up such a staggering success as What You Won\\'t Do for Love; during this time, his Japanese audience steadily eclipsed his American one. The Cat in the Hat (1980) and Carry On (1982), were artistic improvements upon the first album, but did not match its commercial success. They were, however, bestsellers in Japan -- The Cat went platinum and Carry On gold—and sealed Bobby\\'s reputation as a superstar in that country.\\n\\n1983 saw Bobby Caldwell put out August Moon, a project bearing a much more rock- than soul-oriented sound, in Japan only; it was released in the United States in the 1990s.\\nHeart of Mine through Where is Love\\n\\nThough August Moon went gold, Caldwell subsequently took a hiatus from recording, instead directing his efforts toward composing songs for other performers (and make his own version of this song), most notably \"Heart of Mine\" for Boz Scaggs, \"The Next Time I Fall\" for Amy Grant and Peter Cetera, \"Janet\" for the Commodores, \"Niagara Falls\" for Chicago, \"The Real Thing\" for Kalapana and \"All or Nothing at All\" for Al Jarreau.\\n\\nCaldwell sold albums at a steady pace throughout the 1990s, producing 1991\\'s Stuck on You, recorded with a sixty-piece orchestra, and 1993\\'s Where is Love, the latter having been recorded with musicians who had previously played with Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett along with a twenty-four piece orchestra.\\n\\nDuring this period, the airplay of his music shifted from the declining R&B radio format to the then-nascent smooth jazz stations. Caldwell is frequently cited as a staple of the genre, with \"What You Won\\'t Do for Love\" as well as lesser-known singles such as \"Real Thing\", \"All or Nothing at All\" (both from Heart of Mine) still featuring prominently on programmers\\' playlists.\\n\\n[edit] Soul Survivor through Come Rain or Come Shine\\n\\n1995 saw the release of Soul Survivor, marking a turn toward coverage of others\\' songs. Though a handful of originals were present, the album was for the most part focused on, appropriately, soul standards such as \"Walk on By\" and \"Your Precious Love\".\\n\\nHe later turned to singing nothing but big band standards and original, yet big band standard-like songs (such as the much-promoted \"Tomorrow\") on 1996\\'s Blue Condition and 1999\\'s Come Rain or Come Shine. Blue Condition was recorded in real-time, live with a sixty-piece string section and twenty-piece jazz band in the same Capitol Records studios used by such icons as Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole and Bobby Darin.\\n\\n[edit] Perfect Island Nights\\n\\nIn 2005, Caldwell released Perfect Island Nights, his first album of mostly original studio material since 1993. The record features a new version \"Rain\", a track which made its debut on his second anthology release, Time and Again, as well as versions of Phil Perry\\'s \"Perfect Island Night\", \"Where is the Love\" (rendered as a duet with Deniece Williams) and \"Our Day Will Come\". Guest players include saxophonist George Shelby and percussionist Russ Miller.\\n\\nFilm soundtracks\\n\\nCaldwell has contributed music to a number of movies. He has both written and performed original songs for 1986\\'s Back to School (\"Educated Girl\"), 1988\\'s Mac & Me (\"Take Me, I\\'ll Follow You\"), 1988\\'s Salsa (\"Puerto Rico\") and its sequel (\"Every Teardrop\").\\n\\nSongs penned by Caldwell but performed by others have appeared in films such as 1989\\'s Ghostbusters 2 (\"The Promised Land,\" performed by James \"J.T.\" Taylor, the lead singer of Kool & the Gang) and 1987\\'s Princess from the Moon (\"Stay With Me,\" performed by Peter Cetera).\\n\\nDue to what Caldwell has cited in interviews a lower cost of use than the original recordings, his versions of big band standards have appeared in several films. Examples include 2002\\'s LakeBoat and 2001\\'s Simone.\\n\\nCaldwell also composed and performed \"Don\\'t Quit,\" the theme song for Body by Jake\\'s workout video of the same name. He also appears in the associated music video, musically urging an actor portraying a weak young man to engage in weight training in order to defeat the bully of a local beach.\\n\\n[edit] Sampling\\n\\nCaldwell\\'s music has been a popular source material for other artists, sometimes of differing genres, to sample. Of the many releases that make use of pieces of Caldwell\\'s work, the following are some of the most prominent:\\n\\n    * Aaliyah\\'s \"Age Ain\\'t Nothin\\' But a Number\" (samples \"What You Won\\'t Do for Love\")\\n    * Da Brat and Mariah Carey\\'s \"Gotta Thing 4 You\" (samples the chorus of \"What You Won\\'t Do for Love\")\\n    * 2Pac\\'s \"Can I Get Your Number\", \"What I Won\\'t Do For Love (Unreleased)\" \"Do for Love\"(Posthumous) and \"Heaven Ain\\'t Hard 2 Find\" (sample \"What You Won\\'t Do for Love\")\\n    * Tatyana Ali\\'s \"Boy You Knock Me Out\" (samples \"What You Won\\'t Do for Love\") On Kiss The Sky (1998)\\n    * Common\\'s \"The Light\" (samples \"Open Your Eyes\")\\n    * Notorious B.I.G.\\'s \"Sky the Limit\" (samples \"My Flame\")\\n    * Portrait\\'s \"heartstrings\" (samples \"My Flame\")\\n    * The Luniz\\'s \"Playa Hata\" (samples \"What You Wont\\' Do for Love\")\\n    * Guru (rapper)\\'s \"Something in the Past\" (samples \"What You Wont\\' Do for Love\")\\n    * Esham\\'s \"24/7\" (samples \"What You Wont\\' Do for Love\")\\n    * Raheem DeVaughn and DJ Jazzy Jeff\\'s \"My Soul Ain\\'t for Sale\" (samples \"What You Won\\'t Do for Love\")\\n    * Goldie\\'s \"What You Won\\'t Do for Love\" is a drum & bass re-working of \"What you Won\\'t Do for Love\"\\n    * Mona Lisa\\'s \"Jus Wanna Please U\" (samples \"What You Won\\'t Do For Love\")\\n    * Medaphoar\\'s \"Can\\'t Hold On\" (samples \"Carry On\")\\n    * Gym Class Heroes \"Viva La White Girl\" (references \"What You Won\\'t Do For Love\")\\n    * Kool G Rap \"Blowin\\' Up in the World\" (samples \"What You Won\\'t Do For Love\")\\n    * Master P featuring Steady Mobb\\'n\\'s \"If I Could Change\" (samples \"what you won\\'t do for love\") in 1997.\\n\\n    * On The New York Undercover episode Singer Montell Jordan cover the song.\\n\\n[edit] Acting\\n\\nAside from a minor role in 1988\\'s Salsa, Caldwell portrayed Frank Sinatra from October 1999 to January 2000 in the Las Vegas stage musical The Rat Pack is Back, garnering positive reviews.\\n\\n[edit] Personal life\\n\\nCaldwell resides on a horse farm in NJ with his wife, Mary, and their children.\\n\\n[edit] Current activity\\n\\nBobby Caldwell is presently devoting his time to live performances.\\n\\n\\n[edit] Japanese audience\\n\\nLike several other singers (such as Boz Scaggs, Peter Cetera, and Daryl Hall), Caldwell has attained a great deal of popularity in Japan. In 1992, he received the nation\\'s equivalent of a Grammy as the \"best international artist.\"\\n\\nHis current career reflects his fame in that country. His albums tend to be released in that country before his own, his tours typically include many prestigious well-attended dates at such venues as the Nagoya Blue Note and, in the early 1990s, he married (and fathered twin daughters with) a woman from Japan.\\n\\nThe Japanese soul/jazz group Skoop on Somebody covered What You Won\\'t Do for Love in their album,「undressed～club SOS～」.\\n\\n TV\\n\\n    * In one episode of \"New York Undercover\" Montell Jordan performs \"What You Won\\'t Do for Love\".\\n\\n Discography\\n\\nLPs\\n\\n    * What You Won\\'t Do for Love (1978) Initially released as Bobby Caldwell.

Callender is an afro American who turned to mystic and reaches himself into Indian raga, philosophies from the East.\\nThe two albums he recorded under his name (\"Rainbow\" in 1968, \"The Way\" in 1971) are currently seen as the two logical sides of a grandiloquent project including numerous musicians from the jazz and raga scenes. Among the featured musicians we can quote the famous \"India raga style\" guitarist Collin Walcott. Bobby Callender composes almost all titles and make some recitations. \"Rainbow\", released in 1968, is a fantastic effort, really amazing, played freely with numerous dialogues between sitar and tabla, with subtle adds of violin, piano and bass (electric). The main elements of composition are the rhythm, very structured, complex and the improvisational jazz / raga which introduces us in a spiritual and floating psychedelic atmosphere.\\nThe two albums are really conceptual, developing short, esoteric tales mostly served by basic themes of eastern instrumentations and odd, spoken words.

       " 'Bobby Freeman (Robert Thomas Freeman, June 13, 1940 – January 23, 2017) was an American rhythm & blues and soul singer, songwriter and record producer. He is best known for his two Top Ten hits, the first in 1958 on Josie Records called \"Do You Want to Dance\" and the second in 1964 for Autumn Records, \"C\\'mon and Swim\".\\n\\nFreeman was born in Alameda County and raised in San Francisco, California. He attended Mission High School. He started singing in a doo-wop group, the Romancers, in his early teens, and first recorded with them for Dootone Records in 1956. Their recordings included \"House Cat\", included on several later rock and roll compilations. However, the group soon fell apart, and Freeman started a new group, the Vocaleers (not to be confused with an earlier group of the same name who recorded \"Is It a Dream\").\\n\\nWhen asked by a local DJ if he had written any songs, he wrote several and recorded them as solo demos. These included \"Do You Want to Dance\", which were heard by a visiting record label executive, Mortimer Palitz of Jubilee Records. He signed Freeman to the label and had the original recording overdubbed in New York by session musicians including guitarist Billy Mure. Released on the Jubilee subsidiary label Josie, \"Do You Want to Dance\" quickly rose to number 5 on the pop chart and number 2 on the R&B chart in early 1958, when Freeman was still only 17. The song was covered later (as \"Do You Wanna Dance\") by Del Shannon, Bobby Vee, the Beach Boys, Johnny Rivers, Bette Midler, John Lennon, Cliff Richard, Marc Bolan & T.Rex, the Mamas & The Papas and the Ramones.\\n\\nFreeman appeared on American Bandstand and toured with such musicians as Fats Domino, the Coasters, and Jackie Wilson. Several of his follow-ups on Laurie, including \"Betty Lou Got a New Pair of Shoes\" and \"Need Your Love\", a ballad, also made the pop charts. He left Laurie in 1960 and signed with King Records, reaching the charts again with \"Shimmy Shimmy\".[6] However, several of Freeman\\'s later recordings for King in the early 1960s went unreleased, for unexplained reasons. He did not return to the charts again until 1964, after signing for the Autumn label, when he had his second top ten hit with \"C\\'mon and Swim\". The song was co-written by label owner and radio DJ Tom Donahue (credited under his birth name, Thomas Coman), and 20-year-old Sylvester Stewart, later known as Sly Stone, and was produced by Stewart.

       " 'Bobby Hebb (July 26, 1938 – August 3, 2010) was an African American singer and songwriter, best known for his writing and recording of Sunny.\\n\\nHebb made his stage debut on his third birthday, July 26, 1941, when tap dancer Hal Hebb introduced his little brother to show business at The Bijou Theater. This was an appearance on The Jerry Jackson Revue of 1942 even though it was 1941, \"that was how Jerry, a big man in vaudeville in the \\'30s, \\'40s, and \\'50s, did things\" noted the singer. Harold Hebb was nine years of age at the time and the young brothers worked quite a few nightclubs before Bobby Hebb entered first grade. Nashville establishments like The Hollywood Palm, Eva Thompson Jones Dance Studio, The Paradise Club, and the basement bar in Prentice Alley as well as the aforementioned Bijou Theater found Bobby and Hal dancing and singing tunes like \"Lady B. Good,\" \"Let\\'s Do the Boogie Woogie,\" \"Lay That Pistol Down Babe,\" and other titles that were popular at that time. Hebb\\'s father, William Hebb, played trombone and guitar, his mother, Ovalla Hebb, played piano and guitar, while his grandfather was a chef/cook on the Dixie Flyer, an express train on the L&N -- Louisville & Nashville railroad. Brother Harold Hebb would eventually join Excello recording artists the Marigolds, documented in Jay Warner\\'s biography of singer Johnny Bragg, the book -Just Walkin\\' in the Rain; while Bobby Hebb, with so much musical influence and inspiration, would go on to pen hundreds upon hundreds of tunes, among them, BMI\\'s number 25 most played song on their website in 2000, the classic \"Sunny.\" \\n\\nGeorgie Fame and Cher, charted with the title in England, but it was the Bobby Hebb original which reached the highest on charts in Europe and America. Covers by Frank Sinatra with Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Stevie Wonder, Frankie Valli, Nancy Wilson, the Four Tops, Wilson Pickett, Dusty Springfield, and so many others, insured the song would reach audiences outside of those who heard and continue to hear it on Top 40 and \"oldies\" stations. But the song reached out beyond Top 40, climbing the country and R&B charts as well. Kal Rudman calls this a rare industry \"hat trick\" in the liner notes on the 1966 Phillips\\' album, but what no one could predict is how the song would find versions by Boney M. and Yambu bringing it to dance clubs, while jazz musicians explored the nuances of this amazing composition in their world. Hebb himself, in 2001, has performed the title with the Kubato Power Jazz Unit and Michael Shea Trio, the latter band featuring Thomas Hebb, Bobby\\'s nephew, on bass. Noted author James Isaacs, whose liner note essays appear in some of the Sinatra boxed sets, provided a list of jazz musicians who have covered Hebb\\'s signature tune: guitarist Pat Martino, singers Ernestine Anderson, Bill Henderson, Anita O\\'Day, organist Joey DeFrancesco, drummer Don Houge, pianists Joe Bonner and Hampton Hawes, trumpeter/flugelhornist Marvin Stamm, alto saxophonist Sonny Criss, and guitarist Stanley Jordan, among others. \\n\\nBobby Hebb\\'s influence goes far beyond \"Sunny.\" When he joined Roy Acuff\\'s Smokey Mountain Boys around 1952 in Nashville, he was one of the first African American artists to perform on The Grand Ole Opry before Charley Pride. Hebb moved to Chicago in 1954: \"I wanted to play some music, and I wanted to advance my career, I didn\\'t find the jazz I was looking for, but I ran into a lot of blues...I worked with Bo Diddley, maybe on an early Ellis McDaniels album.\" The song was \"Diddly Diddly Diddly Daddy\" with the Moonglows and Little Walter, recorded at Leonard Chess\\' studio in the back of his record shop on Cottage Grove Ave, \"Leonard was the engineer,\" Hebb noted while telling this part of his rich history. \\n\\nHebb joined the navy in 1955, playing the trumpet: \"I learned West Coast jazz in the navy.\" The navy band was the USS Pine Island Pirates and they played \"the whole time we were on board,\" including Hong Kong, performing for Madame Chiang Kai-shek (Sooong Mel-llng) at an event. The band got to meet Chiang Kai-shek as well. \\n\\nAround 1958 Bobby Hebb tracked \"Night Train to Memphis,\" a song written by Owen Bradley for Roy Acuff\\'s Smokey Mountain Boys. The tune was re-released in 1998 on a Warner Bros. box set, From Where I Stand, which also included \"A Satisfied Mind\" from the 1966 Sunny album. After that Hebb worked with Dr. John and left Nashville for New York. Disc jockey John \"R\" Richbourg, owner of Rich Records, which had released \"Night Train to Memphis,\" got Hebb a gig at Sylvia Robinson\\'s Blue Morocco Club. \"I went for two weeks and stayed two years. The first two weeks I opened up with a Bobby Blue Bland song \"Farther on Up the Road.\" The band playing behind me was Jimmy Castor, later on Bernard Purdie had just come to New York from Baltimore with Jewel Page.\" Hebb eventually replaced Mickey in Sylvia Robinson\\'s group Mickey & Sylvia, who originally hit with \"Love Is Strange.\" The duo became Bobby & Sylvia after Mickey left for Paris. \\n\\nAfter Bobby & Sylvia, Hebb was represented by Buster Newman, the man who \"got \"Sunny\" happening in a lot of different ways.\" All the publishers they went to turned the song down! Newman\\'s partner was Lloyd Greenfield, who managed Tom Jones and Engelbert Humperdinck, adding to his roster Bobby Hebb. While other groups in 1966 like Remains and the Ronnie Spector-less Ronettes opened for the Beatles, Bobby Hebb was headlining the tour with the Beatles, a fact that seems to have gotten lost in the overwhelming history of the Fab Four. After this, Hebb met comedian/composer Sandy Baron and the two got busy writing a Broadway show that never made it to Broadway. However, two of the songs -- \"A Natural Man\" and a tune they were writing about Marvin Gaye, \"His Song Shall Be Sung\" -- were picked up by Lou Rawls and released on MGM. \"A Natural Man\" the pair had actually rejected from their Broadway play. The original title of the song was \"Natural Resource,\" but they doctored it up and gave it a different groove after Sandy Baron got Rawls interested in what became a huge hit for him. In 2001, the song will be the title track of a best-of Universal released on Lou Rawls. Sadly, Baron passed away in 2001, the year that saw the release of Roof Music\\'s 16-track compilation of artists covering \"Sunny,\" and interest in Europe for the song and the man who wrote and sang the definitive version. On July 28, 2001, two days after Hebb\\'s 63rd birthday, this writer phoned Bernard Purdie at The House of Blues in Cambridge, MA, where Pretty Purdie was performing that night with Masters of Groove and for the first time in over three decades, Bobby Hebb and Bernard Purdie spoke on the phone and got to see each other at the show that evening. Bobby Hebb performed in June of 2001 at the opening of the Martini & Rossi 100 Years photo exhibit in Boston, shortly after graduating mini-med school.\\n\\n We are currently looking for Bobby\\'s performances with Poppa John Gordy on 78 rpm and his publishing demo \"The Bostonian.\" Also, we are seeking his video to \"You Want To Change Me\" taped in the Gloucester area a few years back for a British company, and any other video footage and audio tapes of this great singer/writer/performer/musician. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bobby+Hebb\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Charles Christopher \"Bird\" Parker, Jr (29th August 1920 – 12th March 1955) was a U.S. bebop saxophonist and composer. Early in his career Parker was dubbed Yardbird; this was later shortened to \"Bird\" (or sometimes \"Yard\") and remained Parker\\'s nickname for the rest of his life, and inspiration for the titles of his works such as \"Ornithology and Yardbird suite\".\\n\\nParker is commonly considered the greatest bebop jazz musician. In terms of influence and impact, his contribution to jazz was so great that Charles Mingus commented that if Bird were alive today, he would think he was living in a hall of mirrors. Bird\\'s talent is compared almost without argument to such legendary musicians as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, and his reputation and legend as one of the best saxophonists is such that some critics say he was unsurpassed.\\n\\nA founding figure of bebop, Parker\\'s innovative approach to melody, rhythm and harmony have exerted an incalculable influence on jazz.. Several of Parker\\'s songs have become standards of the repertoire, and innumerable musicians have studied Parker\\'s music and absorbed elements of his style.\\n\\nParker became an icon for the Beat generation, and was a pivotal figure in the evolving conception of the jazz musician as an uncompromising artist and intellectual, rather than just a popular entertainer. At various times, Parker fused jazz with other musical styles, from classical (seeking to study with Edgard Varese and Stefan Wolpe) to Latin music (recordings with Machito), blazing paths followed later by others.\\n\\nParker was known for often showing up to performances without an instrument and borrowing someone else\\'s at the last moment. At more than one venue he played on a plastic Grafton saxophone; later, saxophonist Ornette Coleman used this brand of plastic sax in his early career. On one particular occasion before a concert in Toronto, Canada, he had sold his saxophone to buy drugs, and at the last minute, he, Dizzy Gillespie and other members of Charlie\\'s entourage went running around Toronto trying to find a saxophone. After scouring all the downtown pawnshops open at the time, they were only able to find a Grafton, which Parker proceeded to use at the concert that night. This concert is documented on the album Jazz at Massey Hall. The album is considered one of the greatest live recordings in Jazz history.\\n\\nParker\\'s battles with alcoholism and heroin addiction ranged from his teenage years until his death from pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer at thirty-four. The toll that the drug had taken on his relatively young body was quite profound - a doctor examining Parker\\'s body estimated him to be around sixty years old. \\n\\nDuring his lifetime, tribute was paid to Parker when a new nightclub in New York was named Birdland in his honour in 1949.Three years later, George Shearing wrote \"Lullaby of Birdland\", which was named for both Parker and the nightclub.\\n\\nOther phenomena also occurred in the United States after the death of Parker, particularly the use of the term \"Bird lives\" in graffiti throughout New York hours after his death, and later as the title of a contemporary art piece of the same name, created by sculptor Robert Graham in 1999. Despite its widespread use, Ted Joans is usually credited with its inception. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Parker\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Some of the artists who influenced Peterson during the early years were Teddy Wilson, Nat \"King\" Cole, James P. Johnson, and the legendary Art Tatum, to whom many have tried to compare Peterson in later years. In fact, one of his first exposures to the musical talents of Art Tatum came early in his teen years when his father played an Art Tatum record to him and Peterson was so intimidated by what he heard that he didn\\'t touch the piano for over a week.\\n\\nHe soon developed a reputation as a technically brilliant and melodically inventive jazz pianist, and became a regular on Canadian radio. His United States introduction was at Carnegie Hall, New York City in 1949 by Norman Granz; owing to union restrictions his appearance could not be billed.\\n\\nSome of his musical associates have included Lester Young, Ray Brown, Ben Webster, Herb Ellis, Ed Thigpen, Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, Louis Armstrong, Stéphane Grappelli, Ella Fitzgerald, Clark Terry, Joe Pass, Count Basie, and Stan Getz. An important step in his career was joining impresario Norman Granz\\'s labels (especially Verve records) and Granz\\'s Jazz at the Philharmonic package, with which he was able to play with the major jazz artists of the time. Granz was also his manager for most of Peterson\\'s career. Some cognoscenti assert that Peterson\\'s best recordings were made for the MPS label in the late \\'sixties and early \\'seventies. For some years subsequently he recorded for Granz\\'s Pablo Records after the label was founded in 1973 and in more recent years for the Telarc label.\\n\\nIn 1993, Peterson suffered a serious stroke that weakened his left side and sidelined him for two years.

In the early 1960s he was considered a teen idol. His most well-known songs include \"Wild One\" and \"Volare\" ; in 1963 he appeared in the musical film Bye Bye Birdie.  In the 1980s he joined a trio called The Golden Boys with fellow former teen idols Frankie Avalon and Fabian Forte and he continued to tour up until his death. \\n\\nRydell\\'s performance in Bye Bye Birdie, and his recordings \"Wild One\" and \"Volare\", made him a famous show business performer of the \\'60s. Rydell used his talents as an impersonator and drummer mostly in pursuing a musical career rather than an acting career. \\n\\nBorn in Philadelphia, it was his father who encouraged him to pursue a career in show business. At the age of four, Rydell would sit in front of the TV and impersonate such performers as Milton Berle, Louis Prima and Johnny Ray. He also admired drummer Gene Krupa and began playing the drums at the age of six. At the age of seven and with his father\\'s encouragement, Rydell began performing in nightclubs in Philadelphia.\\n\\nIn 1950, Rydell entered the amateur show of Paul Whiteman; his first-place win gained him a regular part on the show. He stayed with the Whiteman show for three years and then went to join several local bands in Philadelphia. It was here too that Bobby Ridarelli became the easier-to-pronounce Bobby Rydell. At 16 he began playing with local groups, landing a spot as a drummer for Rocco and the Saints. (Frankie Avalon, another Philadelphia-born musician, played trumpet for the group.) While with the band, Rydell signed a recording contract with Cameo/Parkway Records in Philadelphia.

He is best known for his song \"Hot Nigga\", (released in July 2014) a song that debuted the \"Shmoney dance,\" which went viral after the release of the music video. The song has so far peaked at 6 on the Billboard Hot 100, with the song being remixed and performed by numerous other artists including Lil\\' Kim, French Montana, Sean Mon Thomas, Juicy J, and Gunplay. On December 17, 2014, New York City Police arrested him, alleging that he was the ringleader of a Crips gang known as GS9, the same as his label, which shot indiscriminately into public crowds and murdered a member of a rival gang. Pollard was charged with for conspiracy to commit murder, weapons possession, and reckless endangerment as part of a 15-person, 69-count indictment that included his brother Javese and fellow GS9 label-mate Rowdy Rebel. Shmurda pled not guilty.\\n\\nShmurda began rapping at the age of 10. The first song he remixed was Crime Mob\\'s \"Knuck If You Buck\" in 2004, but did not receive any notable attention until 2014 with the release of the song \"Hot Nigga\". The song features the beat from the Lloyd Banks\\' song \"Jackpot\". Shmurda gained notoriety from the video where he performs the \"Shmoney dance\", choreography that he made in the summer of 2013. The song became popular among Vine users and soon led to the \"Shmoney dance\" meme, which has since been performed by Beyoncé on her On the Run Tour with Jay-Z, as well being used by Drake while hosting the 2014 ESPY Awards.Freestyles of the song by various rappers have since been released, including by Juicy J, French Montana, Lil\\' Kim, Gunplay and T.I.. The song peaked at No. 21 on the Billboard Rap Digital chart with a remix of the song featuring Chris Brown, Jadakiss and Busta Rhymes having been released in 2014. In July 2014, Shmurda performed with Meek Mill and later signed a recording deal with Epic Records. On August 29, 2014, Shmurda released a reggae remix featuring Junior Reid, Mavado, Popcaan and Jah X.

       " 'There is more than one artist with the name Bobby.\\n\\n1. BOBBY (hangul: 바비) (born Kim Ji-won; December 21, 1995 in Seoul, South Korea), is a South Korean rapper and member of the boy group iKON, currently signed under 143 Entertainment.\\n\\nIn 2014, he was the winner of the third season of the Mnet rap competition Show Me the Money. Alongside MINO, he is part of the hip hop duo MOBB, who released the four-track album The Mobb in September 2016.\\n\\n\\n2. BOBBY first attempted to make contact with Tom Greenberg (Twiglet) at college, but no one really noticed BOBBY until everyone had already graduated. He had, in all likelihood, been there since early ’09—a stowaway on Uncle Marth’s back chunk—soaking up all the sick milk he could stick his soft little hands into. When Tom finally did meet him face to face in the Spring of 2010, Bobby became nervous and got sick all over his little brown tap shoes and turned into a mist. He was naught but vapor for a whole month, but soon after that, they fell in together; Tom making tunes to accompany Bobby’s sad dances. \\n\\nAfter a few shows put on for the local ghouls down at the rotary club, it was clear BOBBY had talent, and Tom started making plans for a BIG SHOW. A group was to be assembled. He got together a few of his college buds that he knew played music. He put Martin Zimmermann (Chunk) on the cans, Paolo Menuez (Pillow) on thweedles, Julian Labat (Crumbles) on low-end, Roby Moulton (Moldy) on wisps and got Molly Sarle (of Mountain Man) to contribute vocally, at the request of BOBBY himself. The resulting sound was a swollen lump of blooming, techni-color spores cast adrift on a warm bed of foam. \\n\\nUnfortunately, it was all a bit too much for Bobby. On the night of the BIG SHOW, he once again got worked up and became sick all over Chunk. BOBBY fled the stage as a mist. Despite BOBBY’s sudden and unexpected departure, the band soldiered on with the performance. The crowd was hurt and angry at first (why had their beloved, lethargic, dancing wunderkind abandoned them?), but the heaving waves of sonorous tones soon spilled into their restless hearts. The recordings from the show caught the ear of Tim Putnam, who quickly signed the group to his label, Partisan Records. \\n\\nHot off the success of the BIG SHOW, the group decided to shack up together. They found a suitable home in western Massachusetts in the town of Montague; a ‘ranch’ style house nestled between a giant gravel pit and a wilderness preserve complete with a filled-in pool and busted sauna. In the crucible of isolation, and in preparation for their recording debut, the blooming lump of spores that they had cultivated for the BIG SHOW blossomed even further. The music was going well, but a name for the group still eluded them. For many months they struggled with this, but in the end decided to name it after their missing front man, BOBBY, still assumed to be lurking as a dark mist within the music. \\n\\n3. BOBBY was formed in Stockholm, Sweden by longtime friends Torben (synthesizers) and Julian (Vocals). By that time BOBBY was like from another planet with their positive popsongs and romantic synthesizers.

       " 'Bobby Vee (born Robert Thomas Velline, April 30, 1943 – October 24, 2016) was an American pop singer who was a teen idol in the early 1960s. \\nAccording to Billboard magazine, he had 38 American Hot 100 chart hits, 10 of which hit the Top 20.\\n\\nVee was born in Fargo, North Dakota, to Sydney Ronald Velline and Saima Cecilia Tapanila. His first single, \"Suzie Baby,\" was written by Vee with a nod to Buddy Holly\\'s \"Peggy Sue\" and recorded for the Minneapolis-based Soma Records in 1959; it drew enough attention and chart action to be purchased by Liberty Records, who signed him later that year. His followup single, a cover of Adam Faith\\'s UK number-one \"What Do You Want?\", charted in the lower reaches of the Billboard pop chart in early 1960. His fourth release, a revival of the Clovers\\' doo-wop ballad \"Devil or Angel\", brought him into the big time with U.S. buyers. His next single, \"Rubber Ball\", made him an international star.\\n\\nVee\\'s 1961 summer release \"Take Good Care of My Baby\" went to number one on the Billboard U.S. listings and number three in the UK Singles Chart. Known primarily as a performer of Brill Building pop material, he went on to record a string of international hits in the 1960s, including \"Devil or Angel\" (U.S. number six), \"Rubber Ball\" (1961, U.S. number six, Australia number one), \"More Than I Can Say\" (1961, U.K. number four), \"Run to Him\" (1961, U.S. number two), \"The Night Has a Thousand Eyes\" (1963, U.S. number three), and \"Come Back When You Grow Up\" (U.S. number three). When Vee recorded \"Come Back When You Grow Up\" in 1967, he was joined by a band called the Strangers. He also recorded, in 1961, a version of the song \"Lollipop\", originally by Ronald & Ruby, which also became a success.\\n\\nVee was also a pioneer in the music video genre, appearing in several musical films, as well as in the Scopitone series of early film-and-music jukebox recordings.\\n\\nHe received the North Dakota Roughrider Award in 1999.\\n\\nHe is mentioned in the film No Direction Home regarding his brief musical association with Bob Dylan and Dylan\\'s suggestion that he was \"Bobby Vee\" after Vee\\'s regional hit.\\n\\nThe Very Best of Bobby Vee, released by EMI/UK on May 12, 2008, charted in the UK top five. On January 17, 2011, EMI/UK released Rarities, a double-CD package with 61 tracks, many of which were previously unreleased. Others included were alternate takes and first-time stereo releases as well as tracks from the album Bobby Vee Live on Tour minus the \"canned\" audience.\\n\\nOn March 28, 2011, he became the 235th inductee into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. In 2014 he was inducted into the Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame.\\n\\nVee\\'s career began amid tragedy. On February 3, 1959, \"The Day the Music Died\", three of the four headline acts in the lineup of the traveling Winter Dance Party—Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and the Big Bopper—were killed, along with the 21-year-old pilot, Roger Peterson, in the crash of a V-tailed 1947 Beechcraft Bonanza airplane (Dion, the second headliner, opted not to travel on the plane). It crashed near Clear Lake, Iowa, en route to the next show on the tour itinerary in Moorhead, Minnesota. Velline, then aged 15, and a hastily assembled band of Fargo schoolboys calling themselves the Shadows volunteered for and were given the unenviable job of filling in for Holly and his band at the Moorhead engagement. Their performance there was a success, setting in motion a chain of events that led to Vee\\'s career as a popular singer.\\n\\nIn 1963, Vee released a tribute album on Liberty Records called I Remember Buddy Holly. In the liner notes, Vee recalled Holly\\'s influence on him and the events surrounding Holly\\'s death:\\n\\nLike so many other people, I became a Buddy Holly fan the very first time I heard him sing. I\\'ve been a fan ever since and I guess I always will be. I remember a few years ago when Buddy was scheduled to appear at a dance in my home town of Fargo, North Dakota. It was going to be a big event for the whole town, but even more so for me. I was anxiously looking forward to seeing Buddy in action.\\n\\nThe day he was to arrive disaster struck, taking Buddy\\'s life, along with the lives of two other fine singers, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper. The shocking news spread through Fargo very quickly. The local radio station broadcast a plea for local talent to entertain at the scheduled dance. About a week before this, I had just organized a vocal and instrumental group of five guys. Our style was modelled after Buddy\\'s approach and we had been rehearsing with Buddy\\'s hits in mind. When we heard the radio plea for talent, we went in and volunteered. We hadn\\'t even named the group up to that time, so we gave ourselves a name on the spot, calling ourselves The Shadows. We appeared at the dance and were grateful to be enthusiastically accepted. Soon afterwards, I made my first record. It was called \"Suzie Baby\" and I was pretty lucky with it; it was a fair-sized hit.\\n\\nFor some time now, I have wanted to make an album in tribute to Buddy, but I wasn\\'t sure it was the proper thing to do. However, during the past year, I have received many requests to do such an album. These requests came not only from my fans and from DJs, but also from Buddy\\'s loyal following---still a large group of devoted fans. It.... gave me the confidence to do the album. From \"Suzie Baby\" to this present album, I have made many records, but I have never forgotten Buddy Holly and his influence on my singing style and my career.\\n\\nVee went on to become a bona fide star and regularly performed at the Winter Dance Party memorial concerts in Clear Lake. His sons are all musicians and have performed with him there.\\n\\nEarly in Vee\\'s career, a musician named Elston Gunnn [sic] briefly toured with the band. \"Gunnn\", whose birth name was Robert Allen Zimmerman, later went on to fame as Bob Dylan.\\n\\nDylan\\'s autobiography, Chronicles, Volume One, mentions Vee and provides complimentary details about their friendship, both professional and personal.\\n\\nIn a concert at Midway Stadium in St. Paul, Minnesota, on July 10, 2013, Dylan said he had been on the stage with many stars, but that none of them were as meaningful as Vee. He said Vee was in the audience and then played Vee\\'s hit \"Suzie Baby\" with emotion. Dylan said (in an audio recording of the concert),\\n\\nThank you everyone, thank you friends. I left here a while back, and since that time, I\\'ve played all over the world, with all kinds of people. And everybody from Mick Jagger to Madonna. And everybody in there in between. I\\'ve been on the stage with most of those people. But the most meaningful person I\\'ve ever been on the stage with, was a man who is here tonight, who used to sing a song called \"Suzie Baby\". I want to say that Bobby Vee is actually here tonight. Maybe you can show your appreciation with just a round of applause. So, we\\'re gonna try to do this song, like I\\'ve done it with him before once or twice.\\n\\nVee and Karen Bergen were engaged July 1, 1963, and married December 28, 1963. They had four children: Jeffery Robert Velline (b. Jan 3, 1965), Thomas Paul Velline (b. October 25, 1966), Robert Bryon Velline (b. August 4, 1967), and Jennifer Joanne Velline (b. May 31, 1972). Karen died of kidney failure on August 3, 2015.\\n\\nOn April 29, 2012, Vee announced on his website that a year prior he had been diagnosed with an early stage of Alzheimer\\'s disease and consequently would withdraw from the music business.\\n\\nOn October 24, 2016, Vee died in Rogers, Minnesota, from complications of early onset Alzheimer\\'s disease.\\n\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bobby+Vee\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Bobby Vinton (born April 16, 1935) is an American pop music singer. At 16, Vinton formed his first band, which played clubs around the Pittsburgh area. With the money he earned, Vinton helped finance his college education at Duquesne University, where he studied music and graduated with a degree in musical composition. While at Duquesne, he became proficient on all of the instruments in the band: piano, clarinet, saxophone, trumpet, drums and oboe.\\n\\nAfter a brief spell in the US Army, Vinton was signed to Epic Records in 1960 as a bandleader: \"A Young Man With a Big Band.\" Two albums and several singles were not successful however, and with Epic ready to pull the plug, Vinton found his first hit single literally sitting in a reject pile. The song was titled \"Roses Are Red (My Love).\" It spent four weeks at No.1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Arguably, his most famous song is 1963\\'s \"Blue Velvet\" that also went to No.1. 23 years later, David Lynch named his movie Blue Velvet after the song. In 1964, Vinton had two #1 hits, \"There! I\\'ve Said It Again\" and \"Mr. Lonely\", the latter now being the basis for Akon\\'s hit \"Lonely.\"\\n\\nIn the 1970s, the \"Polish Prince\" continued to hit the Top 40, notably with \"Ev\\'ry Day of My Life\" and \"Sealed With a Kiss\" in 1972. That same year, Epic Records decided to end its relationship with Vinton and ended his recording contract. Undeterred, Vinton spent $50,000 of his own money on a self-written song sung partially in Polish: \"My Melody of Love.\" After Vinton was turned down by 7 major labels, ABC Records bought Vinton\\'s idea, and the result was a multi-million selling single that hit #1 on the AC charts in 1974. A gold album, Melodies of Love, followed as well as a successful half-hour variety show \"The Bobby Vinton Show\" (which aired from 1975 to 1978). He also starred in two John Wayne movies: Big Jake and The Train Robbers.\\n\\nIn the course of his career, Vinton has sold over 75 million records (singles, albums, compilation inclusions, etc) and is still performing on tour and at the Bobby Vinton Blue Velvet Theatre in Branson, Missouri. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bobby+Vinton\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Will Oldham (born 24 December 1970, Louisville, Kentucky) is an American singer-songwriter, actor, and musician. His music is often (perhaps inappropriately) placed under the genre of “alt-country”. Oldham has recorded under many names, including Palace, Palace Music, Palace Brothers, and Bonnie Billy. He often plays and records with other musicians, including David Pajo and his brothers Ned and Paul Oldham, but is generally the chief creator of the music. He has also been involved in musical projects and bands such as Amalgamated Sons of Rest, The Anomoanon, The Boxhead Ensemble, Tortoise, and The Sundowners as well as releasing his first solo album in 1993. Oldham has said that the Bonnie ‘Prince’ Billy moniker has many references. These include ‘Bonnie’ Prince Charlie, an 18th century Jacobite; Billy the Kid, the 19th century American outlaw also known as William Bonney; and the American singer Nat King Cole. He has also appeared in several films, such as the 1987 film Matewan and most recently in Old Joy (released in late 2006). He is also the photographer of the cover image of the Slint album Spiderland. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bonnie+%22Prince%22+Billy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Bonnie Guitar (Bonnie Buckingham, Seattle, Washington, March 25, 1923 – January 13, 2019) was an American singer, musician, producer and businesswoman. She was best known for her 1957 country-pop crossover hit \"Dark Moon\". She became one of the first female country music singers to have hit songs cross over from the country charts to the pop charts. She appeared as herself on an episode of To Tell The Truth with Johnny Carson, Ralph Bellamy, Dina Merrill, and Betty White, and tricked three of the panelists (Carson, Bellamy and Merrill).\\n\\nShe raised cattle and quarter horses in Orting, Washington with her second husband, Mario DePiano, whom she married in 1969. He died in 1983. She co-founded the record company Dolton Records in the late 1950s, that launched the careers of The Fleetwoods and The Ventures. In 1960 she left Dolton and became part owner of Jerden Records. She was first married to musician and inventor Paul Tutmarc.\\n\\nBorn in 1923 in Seattle, Washington to John and Doris Buckingham, Bonnie was initially raised in Redondo Beach along Puget Sound. Later, the family (including her five siblings) moved inland to a farm just outside the rural town of Auburn. She began performing at age 16, having taken up playing the guitar as a teenager, which led to her stage name, Bonnie Guitar. She later started songwriting. In 1944 she married her former guitar teacher Paul Tutmarc. The couple had one daughter, Paula (born 1950), but split up in 1955, and Bonnie moved to Los Angeles. Through much of the 1950s, she worked as a session guitarist at quite a few small labels, like Abbot, Fabor, and also Radio Recorders.\\n\\nWorking at these places got Guitar noticed as a professional guitarist as she ended up playing on sessions for many well-known singers, like Jim Reeves, Dorsey Burnette, Ned Miller, and the DeCastro Sisters. After working with so many singers, she acquired her own singing aspirations herself and a desire to make her very own recording career in the process.\\n\\nFollowing the release of her first single, \"If You See My Love Dancing\" on Fabor Records, Bonnie heard a demo of \"Dark Moon\" from Fabor\\'s owner, Fabor Robinson, a tune written by Ned Miller, with whom she worked as a session guitarist. Robinson was dissatisfied with how Dorsey Burnette sang a version of it and offered it to Guitar. \"I said, \\'I\\'ll give up my royalties and everything just to do this song,\\'\" she told Robinson in recounting their collaboration on \"Dark Moon\" to Wayne Jancik in The Billboard Book of One-Hit Wonders. \"I knew it was up for grabs and somebody was gonna get it. I got it, but he took me at my word, and I really did give up my royalties. It was one of the hardest things I ever put together. Ned [Miller] wrote it, but we tried in maybe five or six different ways in different studios before it came out right.\" The final version consisted of just two guitars and a bass backing Bonnie.\\n\\nThe song was originally issued under Fabor Records in 1956. \"Dark Moon\" was then issued over to Dot Records and by the spring of 1957, \"Dark Moon\" hit the pop top 10 list and went into the country top 15 list. Guitar officially had a hit.\\n\\nWhen Bonnie\\'s rendition of \"Dark Moon\" hit the country and pop charts in the Spring of 1957, she received recognition in the music business. Not only was she one of the few female Country singers in Country Music at the time, but she was also one of the few Country singers that had a hit on the Country and Pop charts at the same time.\\n\\nOnly one other female country singer was achieving this type of crossover success Guitar was having at the time, which was Patsy Cline, when her single \"Walkin\\' After Midnight\" was a No. 2 Country hit and a No. 12 Pop hit at the same time. \"Dark Moon\" brought Guitar a wide audience, and she was soon appearing on quite a few Pop Music programs.[citation needed] Similar to Patsy Cline, Bonnie couldn\\'t follow-up her crossover success either. Her follow-up to \"Dark Moon\" called \"Mister Fire Eyes\" failed to make a substantial impact on the Pop charts, making it only to No. 71 there. On the Country charts though, it was again a Top 15 hit. Because she couldn\\'t follow-up her crossover success, her contract soon ended with Dot Records, and Guitar returned to Washington.\\n\\nGuitar however decided she would form her very own record label called Dolphin Records which she co-founded with refrigerator salesman Bob Reisdorff. When the pair decided to rename the label Dolton Records, many of Guitar\\'s singles like \"Candy Apple Red\" and \"Born to Be With You\" were released. In 1959, her own recording career was superseded by that of a high school trio called The Fleetwoods. The trio was signed to the Dolton label and soon had major Pop Music hits in the Spring and Summer of 1959, with two No. 1 hits, \"Come Softly to Me\" and \"Mr. Blue\". Guitar was soon credited as one of the people who helped launch The Fleetwoods into major music stardom.\\n\\nSoon another group called The Ventures were signed to Bonnie\\'s Dolton label. They too had a monster hit called \"Walk Don\\'t Run\". However, Bonnie thought it was time she would get her own music career back on foot. She soon left Dolton, and went back to Dot Records where she recorded a series of country albums throughout the 1960s.\\n\\nIn the summer and fall of 1963, she took a temporary leave to record a concept album under contract with Charter Records. The album told a romantic story beginning with songs featuring themes about first sight, through courting, going steady, threats from others, getting engaged, getting it broken off, having the man marry someone else and finally having the woman live happily ever after on her own at the end.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the original heyday of concept albums by the likes of Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole had long since been over by 1964, and the new times for concept albums by the likes of the Beatles and Pink Floyd were a few years off yet, so the album was shelved. Even though the album was never released commercially, in its original format, a single was released entitled Outside Looking In, however it failed to show on either the country or pop charts.\\n\\nWhite-label Charter test pressings of the original concept album exist though, and most of the songs thereon found their way onto subsequent albums, with the remaining material such as the country remake version of Dark Moon and Ned Miller\\'s Lucky Star being featured in a 1972 Paramount Records double-album compilation of her work.\\n\\nIt was in 1966 that she began a brief stint as one of the most successful female soloists in the country music field. \"I\\'m Living in Two Worlds\" became Guitar\\'s first Top 10 Country hit (it record also hit the pop Hot 100). She scored an even bigger country success in 1967 with the No. 4 hit \"A Woman in Love\". That same year, she won the Academy of Country Music\\'s \"Top Female Vocalist\" award. In 1968, \"I Believe in Love\" was another Top 10 hit. Guitar teamed up with Buddy Killen, and together they had a minor hit duet with \"A Truer Love You\\'ll Never Find (Than Mine)\" which was issued in 1969 at a time when Guitar\\'s chart success was starting to fade.\\n\\nIn the 1970s, Guitar recorded for Columbia Records and MCA Records with occasional minor hit records. She charted for the first time in many years in 1980 with the single \"Honey On the Moon\". In 1986, she recorded for the Tumbleweed label. She later continued performing and playing until she announced she was retiring in 1996. She lived in Soap Lake, Washington and in 2014 started producing and writing music and still performed on weekends at the age of 92 with her band.\\n\\nBonnie Guitar died on January 13, 2019, at the age of 95.\\n\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bonnie+Guitar\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Patricia \"Bonnie\" Pointer (born on July 11, 1951 in Oakland, California, died on June 8th, 2020) was an American R&B and disco singer most notable for being the next-to-youngest member of the popular 1970s and 1980s family music group, The Pointer Sisters. She scored several solo hits after leaving the Pointers in 1977 including a disco cover of the Elgins\\' \"Heaven Must Have Sent You\" in 1978.\\n\\nBonnie and youngest sister June began singing together as teenagers and in 1969 the duo had co-founded The Pointers (otherwise known as The Pair). After Anita joined the duo that same year, they changed their name to The Pointer Sisters and recorded several singles for Atlantic between 1971 and 1972. In 1972, they recruited oldest sister Ruth and released their debut as The Pointer Sisters in 1973. Their self-titled debut yielded the big hit, \"Yes We Can Can\", which put the Pointers on the musical map.\\n\\nBetween 1973 and 1977, the Pointers\\' original look - displaying 1940s fashions and singing in a style reminiscent of the Andrew Sisters, the group also melded the sounds of R&B, funk, rock & roll, gospel, country and soul. It was Anita and Bonnie who wrote the group\\'s crossover country hit, \"Fairytale,\" in 1974, which also became a top 20 pop hit and helped won the group their first Grammy for country. Anita and Bonnie also were nominated for Best Country Song at the same ceremony.\\n\\nIn 1977, the group was hit professionally after Bonnie suddenly left the group to begin a solo career leaving the quartet a trio. Fortunately for the Pointer Sisters, they continued scoring hits into the late-1980s finding super-stardom with their 1983 album, Break Out and issuing \\'80s hits such as \"He\\'s So Shy\", \"Slow Hand\", \"I\\'m so Excited,\" \"Jump (for My Love),\" \"Automatic\" and \"Neutron Dance\".\\n\\nSigning with Motown in 1978, Pointer released the classic disco single, \"Heaven Must Have Sent You.\" She would release three solo albums, including two self-titled albums for Motown, before retiring from the studio though she still continues to perform. Bonnie reunited with her sisters on two separate occasions: reuniting with them as the group received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1994 and another performing with them in 1996 singing \"Jump (For My Love)\" during a performance in Las Vegas. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bonnie+Pointer\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Bonnie Raitt, (born November 8, 1949) is an American blues and R&B singer, songwriter, and guitarist who was born in Burbank, California, the daughter of Broadway musical star John Raitt.\\n\\nRaitt began playing guitar at an early age, something not a lot of her high school girlfriends did. \"I had played a little at school and at camp,\" she later recalled in a July 2002 interview. \"My parents would drag me out to perform for my family, like all parents do, but it was a hobby—nothing more...I think people must wonder how a white girl like me became a blues guitarist. The truth is, I never intended to do this for a living. I grew up...in a Quaker family, and for me being Quaker was a political calling rather than a religious one.\"\\n\\nIn 1967 Raitt continued her pursuit in that path when she entered Harvard\\'s Radcliffe College as a freshman, majoring in African Studies. \"My plan was to travel to Tanzania, where President Julius Nyerere was creating a government based on democracy and socialism,\" Raitt recalled. \"I wanted to help undo the damage that Western colonialism had done to native cultures around the world. Cambridge was a hotbed of this kind of thinking, and I was thrilled.\"\\n\\nOne day, Raitt was notified by a friend that blues promoter Dick Waterman was giving an interview at WHRB, Harvard\\'s college radio station. An important figure in the blues revival of the 1960s, Waterman was also a resident of Cambridge. Raitt went to see Waterman, and the two soon became friends, \"much to the chagrin of my parents, who didn\\'t expect their freshman daughter to be running around with 65-year-old bluesmen,\" recalled Raitt. \"I was amazed by his passion for the music and the integrity with which he managed the musicians.\"\\n\\nDuring Raitt\\'s sophomore year, Waterman relocated to Philadelphia, and a number of local musicians he counted among his friends went with him. Raitt had become a strong part of that community, recalling that \"these people had become my friends, my mentors, and though I had every intention of graduating, I decided to take the semester off and move to Philadelphia...It was an opportunity that young white girls just don\\'t get, and as it turns out, an opportunity that changed everything.\"\\n\\nRaitt eventually went back to school, but her time performing in Philadelphia had encouraged her to pursue music as a career. When Waterman contacted her and invited her to tour with The Rolling Stones, she made a second trip to the admissions office at Radcliffe and told them, \"I\\'m going to take a leave of absence, but this is only going to last a year.\" As Raitt would later recall, \"Imagine being 20 in 1970—wouldn\\'t you have gone on tour with the Rolling Stones?\"\\n\\nBy now, Raitt was also playing both folk as well as rhythm and blues clubs in the Boston area, performing alongside established blues legends like Howlin\\' Wolf, Sippie Wallace, and Mississippi Fred McDowell, all of whom she met through Waterman. In the fall of 1970, while opening for Fred McDowell at the Gaslight Cafe in New York, a reporter from Newsweek Magazine saw her and began to spread word of her performance. Scouts from major record companies were soon attending her shows to watch her play. She eventually accepted an offer with Warner Bros. who soon released her eponymously titled debut in 1971. The album was warmly received by the music press, many of which praised her skills as an interpreter and as a bottleneck guitarist; at the time, very few women in popular music had strong reputations as guitarists.\\n\\nWhile admired by those who saw her perform, and respected by her peers, Raitt gained little public acclaim for her work. Her critical stature continued to grow but record sales remained modest. Her second album, Give It Up, was released in 1972 to universal acclaim, and though many critics still regard it as her best work, it did not change her commercial fortunes. 1973\\'s Takin\\' My Time was also met with critical acclaim, but these notices were not matched by the sales.\\n\\nRaitt was beginning to receive greater press coverage, including a 1975 cover story for Rolling Stone Magazine, but with 1974\\'s Streetlights, reviews for her work were becoming increasingly mixed. By now, Raitt was already experimenting with different producers and different styles, and she began to adopt a more mainstream sound that continued through 1975\\'s Home Plate.\\n\\nIn 1976, Raitt made a notable appearance on Warren Zevon\\'s self-titled album with Warren Zevon\\'s friend Jackson Browne and Fleetwood Mac\\'s Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks.\\n\\n1977\\'s Sweet Forgiveness gave Raitt her first commercial breakthrough when it yielded a hit single in her cover of Del Shannon\\'s \"Runaway.\" Recast as a heavy r&b recording based on a rhythmic groove inspired by Al Green, Raitt\\'s version of \"Runaway\" was disparaged by many critics, but its commercial success prompted a bidding war between Warner Bros. and Columbia Records. \"There was this big Columbia – Warner war going on at the time,\" recalled Raitt in a 1990 interview. \"James Taylor had just left Warner Bros. and made a big album for Columbia...And then, Warners signed Paul Simon away from Columbia, and they didn\\'t want me to have a hit record for Columbia — no matter what! So, I renegotiated my contract, and they basically matched Columbia\\'s offer. Frankly the deal was a really big deal.\"\\n\\nWarner Bros. held higher expectations for Raitt\\'s next album, 1979\\'s The Glow, but it was released to poor reviews as well as modest sales. Raitt would have one commercial success in 1979 when she helped organize the five MUSE (Musicians United for Safe Energy) concerts at Madison Square Garden. The shows spawned a three-record gold album as well as a Warner Bros. feature film, No Nukes. The shows featured co-founders Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, John Hall, and Raitt as well as Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, The Doobie Brothers, James Taylor, Gil Scott-Heron, and numerous others.\\n\\nFor her next record, 1982\\'s Green Light, Raitt made a conscious attempt to revisit the sound of her earlier records, but to her surprise, many of her peers and members of the press would compare her new sound to the burgeoning New Wave movement. The album received her strongest reviews in years, but her sales did not improve and this would have a severe impact on her relationship with Warner Bros.\\n\\nIn 1983, as Raitt was finishing work on her follow-up album, titled Tongue & Groove, Warner Bros. cleaned house, dropping a number of major artists from their roster. Van Morrison and Arlo Guthrie were two of the most high-profile cases, and the day after mastering was completed on Tongue & Groove, Raitt was notified that she was to be dropped too. The album was shelved indefinitely, and Raitt was left without a label. By now, Raitt was also struggling with alcohol and drug abuse.\\n\\nDespite her personal and professional problems, Raitt continued to tour and participate in political activism. In 1985, she sang and appeared in the video of \"Sun City,\" the anti-apartheid record written a produced by Steven Van Zandt. Along with her participation in Farm Aid and Amnesty International concerts, Raitt would later travel to Moscow in 1987 as part of the first joint Soviet/American Peace Concert later shown on Showtime television. Also in 1987, Raitt would organize a benefit in Los Angeles, for Countdown \\'87 to Stop Contra Aid, featuring herself, Don Henley, Herbie Hancock, Holly Near and others.\\n\\nTwo years after dropping her from their label, Warner Bros. notified Raitt of their plans to release Tongue & Groove. \"I said it wasn\\'t really fair,\" recalled Raitt. \"I think at this point they felt kind of bad. I mean, I was out there touring on my savings to keep my name up, and my ablility to draw was less and less. So they agreed to let me go in and recut half of it, and that\\'s when it came out as Nine Lives.\" A critical and commercial disappointment, 1986\\'s Nine Lives would be Raitt\\'s last new recording for Warner Bros.\\n\\nIn late 1987 she joined k.d. lang and Jennifer Warnes as female background vocals for Roy Orbison\\'s television special, Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night. By now, Raitt was clean and sober, having broken her substance abuse — for which she would credit Stevie Ray Vaughan in a Minnesota State Fair concert[1] the night after Vaughan\\'s 1990 death. Following this highly acclaimed broadcast, she began working on new material. During this time, Raitt considered signing with Prince\\'s own label, Paisley Park, but negotiations would ultimately fall through. Instead she began recording a bluesy mix of pop and rock under the production guidance of Don Was at Capitol Records.\\n\\nRaitt had met Was through Hal Wilner, who was putting together Stay Awake, a tribute album to Disney music for A&M. Was and Wilner both wanted Raitt to sing lead on an adult-contemporary arrangement created by Was for \"Baby Mine,\" the lullaby from Dumbo. Raitt was very pleased with the sessions, and she asked Don to produce her next album.\\n\\nAfter more than twenty years of singing and recording popular music, Bonnie Raitt achieved immense success with her 10th album. Released in 1989, Nick of Time went to the top of the U.S. charts and won three Grammy Awards. At the same time, she walked away with a fourth Grammy Award for her duet \"In the Mood\" with John Lee Hooker on his album \"The Healer\".\\n\\nShe followed up this success with three more Grammy Awards for her 1991 album, Luck of the Draw, then, in 1994 she added two more Grammy\\'s with her album Longing in Their Hearts. Both of these albums were multiplatinum successes. Raitt\\'s collaboration with Was would amicably come to an end with 1995\\'s live release, Road Tested. Released to solid reviews, it sold well enough to be certified gold.\\n\\nFor her next studio album, Raitt hired Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake as her producers. \"I loved working with Don Was but I wanted to give myself and my fans a stretch and do something different,\" Raitt said. Her work with Froom and Blake was released on Fundamental in 1998.\\n\\nIn March of 2000, Raitt was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\\n\\nSilver Lining was released in 2002 while Souls Alike was released in September of 2005. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bonnie+Raitt\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Known as the Warlord, the Ghetto Gladiator, the Poor Peoples\\' Governor, and the Five Star General, Bounty Killer is one of dancehall reggae\\'s most enduring artists and influences throughout the industry, known for his intricate, war-like lyrics, sound system dubplates, and stable of artists which has changed over the years but never lessened in popularity.\\n\\nBounty Killer, aka Rodney Basil Price, was born 12.06.1972 in the Trenchtown area of downtown Kingston, Jamaica, with his family moving to a next ghetto area of Riverton City (formerly known as Dungle), and finally Seaview Gardens, Kingston, as a young child. One of nine children to his mother \"Miss Ivy\" and father, owner of a small sound system, Rodney first picked up the mic as a deejay at nine years old.\\nHe nearly lost his life to gun violence at 14, but thankfully fully recovered from the bystander assault and soon began his music career as Bounty Hunter. He joined neighborhood friends Nitty Kutchie and Boom Dandemite in seeking out opportunities in country as well as town, performing for Metromedia and Bodyguard, as well as other local area sound systems. It was during a chance meeting with brother of King Jammy, Uncle T, which would change his career forever.\\n\\nBounty\\'s initial recordings were done by Uncle T, after Jammy himself was skeptical due to the violent nature of the tracks. Jammy eventually relented upon witnessing the rising popularity of the deejay.\\nHis first hit record on the sound system circuit was Dub Fi Dub and other recordings with the King Jammys label were compiled into 1993\\'s Jamaica\\'s Most Wanted, later released as Roots, Reality and Culture. By 1993, now known internationally as Bounty Killer, Rodney was quickly becoming regarded as one of the fiercest and most lyrically gifted of the next generation of deejays. Hits such as Coppershot, Lodge, and Spy Fi Die quickly propelled Bounty to an upper-echelon deejay, and sound system dubplate favorite. \"Coppershot\" was actually a hit in New York before Jamaica, which left Bounty as personally indebted to the American city as much as his native Kingston. 1993 also brought the beginning of a long, on-and-off rivalry with Beenie Man, which culminated in a battle at Sting 1993, extended through the mid-90s and flared up again in the latter half of the following decade.\\n\\nBounty won the war at Sting 1993 and his legacy as dancehall superstar was cemented as a result. The mid-1990s brought hit after hit, such as Cellular Phone, Not Another Word, and Mama. The heated war-of-words with Beenie Man gave the world many popular tunes from each side, including Ask Fi War, Suspense, and War Beyond The Stars. \\n\\nThe mid-90s era culminated in the release of My Xperience in 1996. The most comercially successful album of Bounty\\'s career, and widely considered one of the best dancehall albums of the decade, it mixed popular dancehall tracks, such as Living Dangerously featuring Barrington Levy and Fed Up, with hip-hop crossover duets featuring Jeru The Damaja, Raekwon and, most popularly, The Fugees.\\nThe decade closed out with two more albums, Next Millenium, which featued more hip-hop guest combinations, and 5th Element, which returned to a more hardcore-dancehall style.\\n\\nBy the year 2000, Bounty Killer, along with Capleton, was still considered the top deejay in the business, particularly with the waning popularity (at the time) of Beenie Man, and refocused career path of Buju Banton. This was due as much to being the most in-demand artist for dubplate recordings by sound systems as to actual studio material.\\nIn 2001, he was featured with No Doubt on their international hit Hey Baby, and appeared with the band for a pre-game performance at the 2002 NFL Super Bowl.\\nIn 2002, Bounty released his most ambitious project since My Xperience, a double CD (released seperately), titled Ghetto Dictionary: The Mystery and Ghetto Dictionary: The Art of War. While not nearly the commercial success of My Xperience, underground sales were strong, and it featured the smash dancehall hit Sufferah.\\n\\nSince the Ghetto Dictionary project, Bounty Killer\\'s influence has mostly been behind-the-scenes, working with young talent and bringing new dancehall reggae stars to the forefront. He has been credited with bolstering the careers of, among others, Elephant Man, Busy Signal, Wayne Marshall, Baby Cham, and Vybz Kartel.\\nHe currently oversees a stable of artists known alternately as The Alliance and Gully, which includes Mavado and Aidonia. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bounty+Killer\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'George Alan O\\'Dowd (born June 14, 1961, in London, United Kingdom), a Irish/British singer, songwriter & DJ who gained fame with his group Culture Club during the 80s. He epitomized the term \"blue-eyed soul\" and received just as much airplay on R&B radio stations as pop stations.\\n\\nGeorge\\'s androgynous style caught the attention of music executive Malcolm McLaren, who arranged for George to perform with the group Bow Wow Wow, featuring Annabella Lwin, at various shows. George called himself Lieutenant Lush and nearly stole the spotlight from Lwin. George and Bow Wow Wow didn\\'t last long after that and George started his own group with bassist Mikey Craig. In Praise Of Lemmings was to be the name of the group. Jon Moss (who had drummed with The Damned, Adam and the Ants and London) came aboard. Shortly thereafter, Roy Hay came into the mix, after an association with another guitarist proved unsatifactory, and they abandoned yet another name, Sex Gang Children. After realizing that the group consisted of an Irish transvestite singer, a Jamaican-Briton on bass, a Jewish drummer, and an Englishman on guitar, they settle on the name Culture Club.\\n\\nThe band signed with Virgin Records in the U.K. and with Epic Records in America, as Virgin didn\\'t have a U.S. presence at the time, and released it\\'s debut album \"Kissing To Be Clever\" in 1982. The first single \"White Boy\" wasn\\'t a mainstream hit and failed to chart but George was still happy because \"five thousand people bought my single and didn\\'t even know me\". The next single, \"I\\'m Afraid Of Me\" also did not become a pop hit. It wasn\\'t until the release of the third single, \"Do You Really Want To Hurt Me\", that the group enjoyed massive success. It hit #1 in sixteen countries (#2 U.S.) and the group became a staple on American radio and the new MTV network. This single was followed by the number two peaking \"Time (Clock Of The Heart)\" and the number nine \"I\\'ll Tumble 4 Ya\". This gave Culture Club the distinction of being the first group since the Beatles to amass at least three top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 from a debut album.\\n\\n1983 and 1984 saw the group at it\\'s peak, dominating charts, MTV, and magazine covers partly due to the release of it\\'s next album \"Colour By Numbers\". First single \"Church Of The Poison Mind\" (featuring Helen Terry) became a Top 10 hit and \"Karma Chameleon\" hit #1 for four weeks in the U.S. and was the biggest selling UK single of the year, having six weeks at No.1). It also became a #1 single in numerous countries around the world and stands as the group\\'s biggest hit. \"Miss Me Blind\" and \"It\\'s A Miracle\" were Top 10 and Top 20 hits respectively and \"Victims\" was another U.K. hit. The group took home the Grammy for Best New Artist - Duo Or Group and George gave a speech to U.S audiences via satellite; \"Thanks America. You\\'ve got style and taste, and you know a good drag queen when you see one\". Colour By Numbers would go on to sell four million copies in the U.S. at it\\'s time of release and millions more worldwide, making Culture Club the biggest group in the world at the time. Years later, Rolling Stone magazine would include the LP in it\\'s list of Top 100 Albums Of All-Time.\\n\\nGeorge\\'s striking looks inspired many Boy George look-alike contests around the world, and his face became the image of Culture Club. He became an alternative teen idol, and had the extravagant lifestyle to go with it. His appeal was due to his likeableness and his wit. He is responsible for one of the 1980\\'s most famous quotes, which he delivered to Barbara Walters on a tv interview - \"I prefer a nice cup of tea to sex\" - which many years later he would say was totally untrue. The fact that he could actually sing and had a distinct soulful voice was a great attribute as well.\\n\\nBy 1985 Boy George had become a household name in many countries around the world. That year he appeared, redheaded, on the Band Aid single to raise money for aid to famine-stricken Ethiopia, with a lead vocal role. The worldwide success of the multi-British and Irish artist single lead to a U.S version, \"We Are The World. And in 1986 he guest-starred on an episode of the A-Team entitled \"Cowboy George\". However, two subsequent Culture Club albums (Waking Up With The House On Fire and From Luxury To Heartache) performed poorly as the band only manage to obtain two more hits; \"The War Song\" and \"Move Away\". Throughout the years, George had been involve in a relationship with Culture Club\\'s drummer Jon Moss and when that fizzled, he turned to drugs to ease the pain. This caused the downward spiral of the group and they eventually disbanded, as George could no longer work with Moss. One sign of the group\\'s imminent breakup was that they didn\\'t appear at the Live Aid event, and they were a major act.\\n\\nGeorge\\'s addiction to heroin was severe and he began an on again-off again fight against the drug for many years. He would appear in public under the influence and even attempted to do concerts in such state. Addictions to other drugs followed and George\\'s brother, in an attempt to save his famous sibling from death, went on U.K. national television and blew the whistle on George. Some of George\\'s associates had died of overdoses but when an American musician he was working with was found dead at his London mansion from an overdose, this hit home for George. He finally quit using drugs.\\n\\nVirgin Records had now set up a U.S. operation and George moved from Epic Records in America to Virgin worldwide. George\\'s first solo album released after the breakup of the band was entitled \"Sold\". It was very successful in the U.K., spawning many hit singles (including the #1 U.K. hit \"Everything I Own\") but he could not duplicate that success in the U.S. He did score a moderate hit with the song \"Living My Life\" (#40 U.S.) from the \"Hiding Out\" soundtrack. His next U.S album would be \"High Hat\", comprised of songs from two of his solo British albums released after \"Sold\". As an album, \"High Hat\" is one of his strongest releases in America material wise, but was overlooked, although it contained the excellent R&B dance number \"Don\\'t Take My Mind On A Trip\", produced by Teddy Riley. The single became a moderate R&B hit. Many of his following releases were songs to protest against the UK\\'s restrictions on sex education relevant to the needs of homosexual students (known as Clause 28). In 1989 George formed his own label, More Protein. He also recorded under the moniker Jesus Loves You, (writing under the pseudonym Angela Dust), releasing an underground club hit \"Generations Of Love\" and what would become a signature song, \"Bow Down Mister\", inspired by his involvement in the Hare Krishna movement.\\n\\n\\nLife after Culture Club\\n\\nIn 1992, George scored a hit with a Pet Shop Boys produced cover version of the song \"The Crying Game\", which was featured on the movie of the same name, and landed in the top twenty on the Billboard Hot 100. Although he had subsequent solo hits in the U.K. since the breakup of the band, this would be his first U.S. hit since Culture Club\\'s 1986 single \"Move Away\". However, he did not capitalized on his resurgence by immediately releasing an album. When he finally did release the rock-driven Cheapness And Beauty a few years later, the momentum had already died. From that album, he released his version of the Iggy Pop song \"Funtime.\" Still, George would say that the \"Crying Game\" era gave him a sense of satisfaction. His former lover Jon Moss had told him, after the messy breakup of Culture Club, that George would never have another major hit in America without the band. George was more than happy to prove him wrong.\\n\\nBoy George continues to remain a global pop icon and a successful music DJ. He once again started touring the world as a DJ in the late 1990s and starred in the London musical Taboo, based on his life (George didn\\'t play himself, opting instead to take on the persona of Australian-born performance artist Leigh Bowery). Taboo was a huge success in London\\'s West End. During 2003 he presented a weekly show on London\\'s LBC radio for 6 months. George has been reported by fans who have met him in person to be an avid autograph signer. In August 1994, a British court tossed out a paternity suit filed against him by a Californian woman.\\n\\nHarper Collins published the autobiography of Boy George, Take It Like A Man, in 1995. George wrote of his relationship with Kirk Brandon, singer with Spear of Destiny and the earlier Theatre of Hate, who began a High Court action against George.\\n\\nGeorge, taking the witness stand, faced a \"malicious falsehood\" charge brought against him by Brandon, now married and a father, who denied that he once had a sexual relationship with George. Brandon lost. During the trial, Boy George had claimed that Kirk Brandon had been the love of his life and that he still loved him.\\n\\nIn his book, George also told his side of his secret relationship with Culture Club drummer Jon Moss. He stated many of the songs he wrote for Culture Club were directed at Moss. He also alleged that Moss had broken off his engagement to be with George, and that Moss was never comfortable in a gay relationship although Moss was bisexual.\\n\\nIn July 1998, a reunited Culture Club performed three dates in Monte Carlo and then joined Human League and Howard Jones in a \"Big Rewind\" tour of the US. The following month, the band appeared on Late Night with David Letterman and made an appearance in Britain, their first in 14 years. Later that year, the band had a Top Ten hit in the UK with \"I Just Wanna Be Loved\".\\n\\nIn 1998, Boy George began writing a weekly column in The Daily Express and hosted a weekly radio show on the Galaxy Radio Network. In October 2005 he was arrested in New York City on suspicion for possession of cocaine and appeared in court in February 2006. George stated the drugs were not his and has declared his innocence.\\n\\n\\nCurrent activity\\n\\nHe\\'s a successful DJ that occassionally tours and remains a pop icon.\\n\\nBoy George has also sung \"Bow Down Mister\" with the Indian songstress, Asha Bhosle.\\n\\nHe has also recently appeared as a guest on the British comedy-talk show The Kumars at No. 42.\\n\\nIn 2005 he published Straight in Britain, his second autobiographical book. He lives in Manhattan.\\n\\nOn October 7 2005, he was arrested in Manhattan on suspicion of possessing cocaine, (BBC Online Report) and appeared in court on 1 February, 2006 (BBC Online Report) on charges of cocaine possession. On 8 March 2006 he pleaded guilty to wasting police time; the charge of possessing cocaine was dropped, and he was given a non-custodial sentence and fined.

       " 'Boyd Bennett was born in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, December 7, 1924. He was raised in the town of Goodlettsville North Davidson County, TN, just outside of Nashville. His family was very musically oriented.\\n          Boyd\\'s grandfather instructed members of local churches how to read music and sing biblical songs. He taught Boyd to read shape note music from church hymnals before he could actually read the English printed lyrics.\\n          Boyd began singing gospel songs with his grandfather at 4 years of age. He grew up singing gospel music with local quartets. During the hard times of his youth, the aftermath of the Great Depression, Boyd played the guitar and sang outside of the old-time Honky Tonks for whatever donations he could muster from patrons.\\n          At the age of 16, in 1941, Boyd\\'s music career was interrupted for four years by the outbreak of World War II. While in service, he perfected the art of playing the guitar.\\n          Boyd trained at the San Diego Naval Training Center and served on different Navy troop transports. He suffered a severe leg wound in the Solomon Islands. Unfortunately, he did not realize until later that his lungs and those of all his shipmates were filled with deadly asbestos dust from the insulation on the exposed pipes.\\n          This lethal asbestos dust disabled and eventually killed many men who served on these ships years later. Pulmonary fibrosis and mesothelioma (cancer of the lungs) became a fatal curse of the sailors that served on navy ships during World War II. Boyd is a miracle survivor, due to alternative medicine therapies and the grace of God. He survived pulmonary fibrosis for 20 years.\\n          After the war, Boyd sang in nightclubs nightly. He continually impressed his audiences with the depth of his repertoire of songs, instrumental versatility and voice quality. He effortlessly fulfilled the audience\\'s musical requests.\\n          During this time, Boyd worked in the music industry and performed with a number of different bands. He had a temporary gig as a drummer and singer with a band led by Francis Craig. Unfortunately, Boyd could not make a decent living playing at the nightclubs so he supplemented his income by working as a disk jockey and radio announcer for local radio stations. Soon he was a famous local radio personality.\\n          In the early 50\\'s, a friend in Owensboro, Kentucky who owned a record store introduced him to a Columbia Records executive. The company liked Boyd\\'s songs and signed him to his first record contract.\\n          His big break in show business came when he was performing regularly on a local radio station as a disk jockey, announcer, and singer. He assembled a band named the \"Southlanders\". They created a unique sound similar to western swing. There was a little honky tonk attitude in the music. Boyd soon reformed and renamed his band, \" The Rockets\".\\n          The members of \"Boyd Bennett and His Rockets\" were also famous musicians in their own right. They played all types of music and were considered a hotel type band, not specifically rock and roll, rockabilly or pop.\\n          Jim Muzey, known as \"Big Moe\", played the trumpet extremely well. At 425 pounds, he was one of the funniest men Boyd ever performed with. M.D. Allen, quite the opposite of \"Big Moe\", weighed only 110 pounds. He played the guitar and was a great comedian. Kenny Cobb, played the bass fiddle and was considered one of the best in the country.

       " 'Boz Scaggs (born William Royce Scaggs on 8 June 1944 in Canton, Ohio) is an American singer, songwriter and guitarist. He gained fame in the 1960s as a guitarist and sometimes lead singer with the Steve Miller Band and in the 1970s with several solo Top 20 hit singles in the United States, along with the #2 album, Silk Degrees. Scaggs continues to write, record music and tour.\\n\\nAfter learning guitar at the age of 12, Scaggs met Steve Miller at St. Mark\\'s School of Texas in Dallas. In 1959, he became the vocalist for Miller\\'s band The Marksmen. The pair later attended the University of Wisconsin together, playing in blues bands like The Ardells and The Fabulous Knight Trains. Leaving school, Scaggs briefly left Texas to join the burgeoning rhythm and blues scene in London. After singing in bands such as The Wigs and Mother Earth, he recorded his first solo album Boz in 1965, which was not a commercial success. He traveled to Sweden as a solo performer and did a brief stint with the band The Other Side with fellow American Jack Downing and Brit Mac MacLeod.\\n\\nReturning to the US, Scaggs promptly headed for the booming psychedelic music center of San Francisco in 1967. Linking up with Steve Miller again, he appeared on the Steve Miller Band\\'s first two albums Children of the Future and Sailor, which won over critical reviews. After being spotted by Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner, Scaggs secured a solo contract with Atlantic Records in 1968. Despite good reviews, his first Atlantic album was met with lukewarm sales, as were followup albums on Columbia Records. In 1976, he linked up with session musicians who would later form Toto and recorded his smash album Silk Degrees. The album reached number 2 on the US charts and number 1 in a number of countries across the world, spawning three hit singles: \"Lowdown\", \"Lido Shuffle\", and \"What Can I Say\", as well as the MOR standard \"We\\'re All Alone\", later a hit for Rita Coolidge. A sellout world tour followed, but his follow-up album, the 1977 Down Two Then Left, lacked the cohesion of Silk Degrees. \\n\\nScaggs\\' 1980 album Middle Man would spawn two top 20 hits, \"Breakdown Dead Ahead\" and \"Jojo,\" and Scaggs would enjoy two more hits over 1980 and 1981 (\"Look What You\\'ve Done to Me\" from the Urban Cowboy soundtrack, and \"Miss Sun\" from a greatest hits set). \\n\\nScaggs continued to record and tour sporadically throughout the 1980s and 1990s, although he semi-retired from the music business and turned owner of the San Francisco nightclub Slim\\'s. His lengthy hiatus from the music industry slowed his chart career down dramatically.\\n\\nScaggs recorded Other Roads in 1988, took another hiatus, and then came back in 1994 with Some Change. In the late 190s he released Come On Home, an album of blues, and My Time, an anthology. He garnered good reviews with Dig, although the CD, which was released on September 11, 2001, was lost in the post-911 melée.

       " 'Carrie Marie Underwood (born March 10, 1983) is an American singer who rose to prominence after winning the fourth season of American Idol in 2005. Underwood\\'s single \"Inside Your Heaven\" made her the only country artist to debut atop the Billboard Hot 100 chart and the only solo country artist in the 2000s to have a number-one song on the Hot 100. Her debut album, Some Hearts (2005), was bolstered by the successful crossover singles \"Jesus, Take the Wheel\" and \"Before He Cheats\", becoming the best-selling solo female debut album in country music history. She won three Grammy Awards for the album, including Best New Artist. The next studio album, Carnival Ride (2007) had one of the biggest opening weeks of all time by a female artist and won two Grammy Awards. Her third studio album, Play On (2009), produced the single \"Cowboy Casanova\", which had one of the biggest single-week upward movements on the Hot 100.\\n\\nWith more than 64 million albums sold worldwide, 18 #1 singles, with seven as co-writes, Seven Grammys, and countless other accolades---all achieved with four albums in less than eight years---some artists might feel as though they’d earned the right to rest on their laurels, but not Carrie Underwood. Fueled by a restless creative spirit, good-natured competitive streak and abundance of God-given talent, Carrie unleashes her most ambitious project yet with Blown Away.\\n\\nTeaming again with producer Mark Bright, Carrie delivers a 14-song collection that covers a particularly vast expanse of emotional territory. She celebrates the understated pleasures of small town living in “Thank God for Hometowns” and explores the exquisite fragility of life in “Forever Changed.” She’s not averse to tackling abuse and betrayal then doling out a little sweet revenge with such compelling tracks as “Blown Away” and “Two Black Cadillacs.” Musically the songs range from rollicking up-tempo anthems, such as the hit first single “Good Girl” to the island-flavored escape of “One Way Ticket” and the steel guitar-laced country lament of “Wine After Whiskey.”\\n\\nSuch musical and lyrical diversity is the foundation of Carrie’s artistry. After all, this is a young woman who has performed with Steven Tyler on a top-rated edition of CMT’s “Crossroads,” scored a No. 1 country hit with good friend Brad Paisley on “Remind Me,” and sang with the iconic Tony Bennett on the 2012 Grammy telecast, delivering the classic “It Had to be You,” their collaboration on Bennett’s Duets II album. \\n   \\nThe Oklahoma native is a fan of all types of music, yet she’s purposefully planted herself in the country format, even while her eclectic tastes have influenced her creative output. She’s been careful to not get pigeonholed and prides herself on not being predictable. “I feel like I’ve taken all of my albums into as many different directions as possible while still keeping them cohesive,” she says. “I love this album from start to finish and love every song on it. There’s not one single song that’s like another song I’ve ever done.  I think it’s my best album.  I really do think there’s something for everyone.”\\n\\nHer ability to be unique yet accessible has been crucial to Carrie’s career from the beginning.  She became America’s sweetheart in 2005 when she won the fourth season of American Idol, a vehicle that transformed her from a shy Oklahoma girl with a great voice to a budding superstar. Since then she’s become the popular franchise’s most successful alumni. \\n\\nShe’s won a vast array of awards including three female vocalist awards from both the Country Music Association (CMA) and the Academy of Country Music (ACM). In 2010, when Carrie garnered her second win as ACM Entertainer of the Year, she became the first female artist to win the award twice, and only the 7th female to take the award in the 40-year history of the ACM category, among Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, Barbara Mandrell, Reba McEntire, Shania Twain, and the Dixie Chicks. Carrie also received the ACM Triple Crown Award, thanks to her past wins for the categories of Entertainer of the Year, Top Female Vocalist and Top New Female Vocalist, which has been won by only one other female artist – Barbara Mandrell in 2004. In addition to the above, Carrie’s won 7 American Music Awards, 6 People’s Choice Awards, 9 CMT Music Awards, 9 American Country Awards, and 7 BMI Songwriter Awards. Carrie also received a Golden Globe nomination in 2010 for “Best Original Song” for “There’s A Place For Us” from Chronicles of Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader which she both recorded and co-wrote.\\n\\nCarrie’s 2005 debut Some Hearts topped Billboard’s Country Albums chart for 27 weeks, has sold over 7 million copies, and was voted #1 Country Album of the Decade by Billboard. Both her 2007 sophomore album, Carnival Ride and 2009’s Play On debuted at No. 1. Her current album, Blown Away, debuted atop the all-genre Billboard 200 chart, where it held the No. 1 spot for two consecutive weeks.  Over the course of four albums, she’s saturated country radio with such hits as “Jesus, Take the Wheel,” “Before He Cheats,” “So Small,” “Last Name,” “Just A Dream,” “Cowboy Casanova,” “Temporary Home,” “All-American Girl,” “Undo It,” “Mama’s Song,” “Good Girl,” and “Blown Away.”\\n \\nCarrie’s highly acclaimed concert tours have further helped to establish her into the elite status of the country music community, or in any genre of music, with her stellar performances. In 2008, after wrapping her “Carnival Ride Tour” she became the top selling country female touring artist of the year selling out many of the 137 shows before 1.2 million fans. In that year, Carrie also became the most-heard artist at country radio and was named the #1 Hot Country Songs Artist by Billboard and #1 Top Country Artist by Radio & Records.  In 2010, her next headline arena tour, the “Play On Tour,” played 108 shows with one million fans attending which resulted in Carrie being named again as the top-ranked female country touring artist of the year. Carrie is currently on her critically-acclaimed international “Blown Away Tour”, which began at London’s historic Royal Albert Hall, and continued throughout Australia, before launching in North America in September of 2012.\\n\\nCarrie is a proud member of the Grand Ole Opry and expanded her resume making her acting debut in the 2011 film “Soul Surfer.” She can be seen in print and TV ads as the North American face of Olay beauty products, and has a long-running deal with   vitaminwater®. One of Country Music’s most respected young ambassadors, Carrie has served as co-host of the CMA Awards with Brad Paisley the past five years.\\n\\nYet for those who think they know Carrie, Blown Away is likely to catch them by surprise, particularly the cinematic title track with its swirling, atmospheric production and intense lyric about abuse and revenge. “I got chills,” she says of the first time she heard the Josh Kear/Chris Tompkins penned stunner.   “I remember where I was when I heard it and called my manager and said, ‘Do not let anyone else have this song. It’s my song’ . . . It’s such a visual song.  You listen to it and you can see everything that is happening. It’s so dramatic.  I’m not a drama person, but when you can make a movie in song form in 3 ½ minutes, it’s surreal.”\\n\\n“Blown Away” finds a daughter getting revenge on an abusive, alcoholic father and the next song, “Two Black Cadillacs,” also has a larger-than-life cinematic quality which makes both tunes feel like mini-movies set to music. “Two Black Cadillacs” relates the story of a wife and mistress who conspire to get even with the man who betrayed them both. “It’s just more drama,” says Carrie, who co-wrote the tune with Josh Kear and Hillary Lindsey. “It was so much fun creating all this drama and singing about it. That’s the great thing about being an entertainer; you’re just a big actor. When we start sitting down and writing songs, you just never know what’s going to come out.”\\n\\nCarrie co-wrote eight of the 14 songs on Blown Away, including the first single, Good Girl\" which reached number 1 on the country airplay charts and is certified platinum. ‘Good Girl’ was one of the last ones I wrote for the album,” she says of the tune she penned with Chris DeStefano and Ashley Gorley. “We wanted something a little more fun and up-tempo. Chris DeStefano is just a mad scientist with his Pro Tools and he can play every instrument.  We walked out of that writing session with a demo. It sounded awesome. It was ready to go. We let everybody hear it and everybody was so excited.”\\n\\n“Cupid’s Got a Shotgun” is another of the album’s high-energy tracks and it gets an extra kick from Paisley contributing his signature guitar licks. “Once we got into the studio, I was like Brad Paisley HAS to play on this. He’ll make the song,” Carrie says of the tune, she wrote with Kear and Tompkins. “We left so much space in the song for him to come in and play. He did his thing and sounded awesome. He added that last piece of the puzzle and it’s just so country.  It’s really cool.”\\n\\nIn addition to being musically inventive, Carrie has long been known for delivering songs with substance, and the new album delivers its share of potent messages. “Nobody Ever Told You,” which Carrie wrote with Luke Laird and Hillary Lindsey, boasts an empowering lyric and a breezy, engaging melody. “People need to hear compliments more,” she says of the song’s life-affirming lyric. “People need to hear ‘I love you’ more. People need to hear ‘You are beautiful’ more.”\\n\\n“Good in Goodbye,” co-written by Carrie, Lindsey and Ryan Tedder, is a bittersweet look at life beyond heartbreak that offers tender truth in the lines “As bad as it was/As bad as it hurt/I thank God I didn’t get what I thought I deserved.”  On the other end of the emotional spectrum, “Thank God for Hometowns” is a sweet salute to small town life. “I heard that one when I was going back to my 10 year high school reunion,” the Checotah, OK native says. “I listened to the demo when I was driving in to go stay with my parents. It was just very fitting in my heart at that time.” \\n\\n“Forever Changed” is a beautiful ballad that brings tears to Carrie’s eyes as she discusses it. “I had a hard time recording it and I still have a hard time listening to it,” she says of the Tom Douglas/Hillary Lindsey/James T. Slater penned ballad. “That is the most wonderfully well written song I’ve ever heard in my life. There’s this young girl meeting the love of her life, getting married and having a baby. It takes you back in time and there is something old fashioned about it. At the end, the mom’s obviously slipping a way a little bit. It is a sad song, but it’s not meant to be a sad song. It’s about love, being forever changed, forever loved.”\\n\\nIn a few short years, Carrie has seen the power music has to change lives---to incite dialog, to instill hope, and to simply entertain. She’s aware of the platform she’s been given. She respects it and appreciates every moment. “I’m very happy in my life and I count my blessings every day,” she says. “Seven years ago when I decided to try out for American Idol, my life changed completely in the blink of an eye. I went down a different train track and took off at about a million miles per hour. I feel like I’m still learning. In the beginning, it was like, ‘Oh, I have a No. 1. That’s awesome!’ I didn’t really understand what that meant. ‘Jesus, Take The Wheel’ and ‘Before He Cheats’ were No. 1 for several weeks, and that doesn’t happen often, but I had no idea. I realize now what hard work it actually is and I feel like I can appreciate those victories even more. Touring is more fun because I know what it’s like to headline a tour. I feel like I’m able to be more and more creative all the time. I always feel like I’m taking steps forward.” <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Carrie+Underwood\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Brandi Carlile (b. June 1, 1981, in Ravensdale, Washington) is an American singer-songwriter, perhaps best known for her 2007 single \"The Story\". Carlile\\'s music has been categorized in several genres, including pop, rock, alternative country, and folk. She released her first album, \\'Brandi Carlile\\', on July 12, 2005.\\n\\nIn the beginning, Columbia Records signed Carlile in late 2004 on the strength of songs she\\'d been recording periodically at home. Released in 2005, Brandi Carlile showcased those early songs along with several newly recorded tracks. Shortly after the release of Brandi Carlile, she left her home in Seattle and set out with the Hanseroth brothers, with whom she\\'d worked on her earliest recordings and independent regional tours. The tightly knit trio, which forms the core of her band today, spent the better part of two years on the road honing the songs that would later become part of her album \"The Story\".\\n\\nIn 2005, she was featured on Rolling Stone\\'s \"10 Artists to Watch in 2005\" list. By the end of 2006, Carlile had embarked on several headlining tours and supported a variety of artists including Ray LaMontagne, The Fray, Chris Isaak, Tori Amos, and Shawn Colvin.\\n\\nHer second album, The Story, was released in April 2007. It was produced by T Bone Burnett and includes a collaboration with the Indigo Girls on \"Cannonball.\" The album was recorded in an eleven-day-long session with Carlile , the twins (Tim and Phil Hanseroth) and drummer Matt Chamberlain to capture the raw intensity of Carlile\\'s live performances. The crack in Carlile\\'s vocals during the title track, \"The Story\", came out by accident and was a direct result of the way the album was recorded. Carlile herself describes the vocals as \"technically wrong but emotionally right.\"\\n\\nCarlile was exposed to a wider audience when ABC\\'s Grey\\'s Anatomy showcased three of her songs: \"Tragedy,\" \"What Can I Say,\" and \"Throw It All Away\". In April 2007, Grey\\'s Anatomy debuted a version of the video for the single The Story interspersed with footage from the show. On May 3, 2007, a special two-hour episode of \"Grey\\'s Anatomy\" featured Carlile\\'s song \"Turpentine\" during footage of the \"Grey\\'s Anatomy\" spin-off, \"Private Practice\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Brandi+Carlile\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Brandon Sanderson was born in December of 1975 in Lincoln, Nebraska. As a child Brandon enjoyed reading, but he lost interest in the types of titles often suggested for him, and by junior high he never cracked a book if he could help it. This all changed in 8th grade when an astute teacher, Mrs. Reader, gave Brandon Dragonsbane by Barbara Hambly. Brandon thoroughly enjoyed this book, and went in search of anything similar. He discovered such authors as David Eddings, Melanie Rawn, Robert Jordan, Anne McCaffrey, and Orson Scott Card. Brandon continued to be an avid reader through junior high and high school. He liked epic fantasy so much that he even tried his hand at writing some. His first attempts, he says, were dreadful.\\n\\nIn 1994 Brandon enrolled at Brigham Young University as a Biochemistry major. From 1995-1997 he took time away from his studies to serve as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Brandon often says that it was during this time in Seoul, Korea that he realized that he didn\\'t miss chemistry one bit, but he did miss writing. Upon his return to BYU Brandon became an English major, much to the dismay of his mother, who had always hoped he would become a doctor.\\n\\nBrandon began writing in earnest, taking a job as the night desk clerk at a hotel because they allowed him to write while at work. During this era he went to school full time during the day, worked nights to pay for his schooling, and wrote as much as he could. He says it made for a rather dismal social life, but he finished seven novels during his undergraduate years. Brandon submitted many manuscripts for publication . . . and accumulated quite a pile of rejection letters. In spite of this he continued to be a dedicated writer.\\n\\nVolunteering for The Leading Edge, BYU\\'s Sci Fi/Fantasy magazine, was a wonderful experience for Brandon. He read lots of submissions, formed some lifelong friendships, and even served as Editor in Chief during his senior year.\\n\\nBrandon learned much about the business side of being a writer by taking a class from David Farland, author of the popular Runelords series. One piece of advice Dave gave Brandon was to attend conventions, such as WorldCon and World Fantasy, in order to connect with industry professionals. Brandon and a small group of friends who were also aspiring writers began to do so. He eventually met both his current agent and one of his editors at conventions.\\n\\nIt was in 2003, while Brandon was in the middle of a graduate program at BYU, that he got a call from an editor at Tor who wanted to buy one of Brandon\\'s books. Brandon had submitted the manuscript a year and a half earlier, and had almost given up on hearing anything, so he was surprised and delighted to receive the offer. In May of 2005 Brandon held his first published novel, Elantris, in his hands. Tor also published Brandon\\'s Mistborn trilogy, and has plans to release other Sanderson titles in the future.\\n\\nIn 2004 after graduating with his Master\\'s degree in creative writing from Brigham Young University, Brandon was asked to teach the class he had taken as an undergraduate student from Dave Farland. In spite of his busy schedule, Brandon continues to teach this one section of creative writing focused on science fiction and fantasy because he enjoys helping aspiring writers. It also gets him out of the house, he says.\\n\\nIn July of 2006 Brandon married Emily Bushman. Emily and Brandon ran in many of the same circles at BYU during their student days, since Emily majored in English as well. They never met, however, until a mutual friend set them up on a date in 2005. Emily had spent seven years as a teacher, but chose to quit with the birth of their son Joel in October of 2007. Emily now works from home part time as Brandon\\'s business manager.\\n\\nBrandon\\'s repertoire expanded into the children\\'s market when Scholastic published Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians, a middle-grade novel, in October of 2007. Nancy Pearl gave this book a very favorable review on National Public Radio, which pleased Sanderson fans. Since the release of Alcatraz Brandon has enjoyed visiting schools and interacting with younger readers.\\n\\nIn December of 2007 Brandon was chosen by Harriet Rigney to complete A Memory of Light, book twelve in Robert Jordan\\'s Wheel of Time series. Brandon is now hard at work on this epic project.\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested in advice on getting published for the first time in the sf/f field, or if you simply want to congratulate Brandon, hop over to his forums. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Brandon+Sanderson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He chose neither one clear\\npath, nor another. Possessing a degree in computer graphics, and having created his first animation short film co-directed with two friends, Thibaut now makes music videos, commercials and such. By day. By night however, he cooks up choice cut electronic music, experimenting with beats, layers, keyboards, vocals, and Daft Punk-esque get-yo-funk-on basslines.\"\\n\\nDiscography:\\n\\nHappy Rabbit EP (2007) Moshi Moshi Records\\nIron Zombie (on the australian version of Happy Rabbit, 2008)\\nPenelope Pitstop (On \"A New French Electronic Generation\", 2009)\\nBaby I\\'m Yours (2010) Ed Banger Records\\nBaby I\\'m Yours Remix EP (2010) Ed Banger Records\\n\\nRemixes:\\n\\n2006\\nJustice - Let There Be Light (Breakbot Remix)\\n\\n2007\\ndatA - Aerius Light (Breakbot\\'s Rework)\\nArrow!!! - D.O.E.S (Breakbot\\'s French Pute Mix)\\n\\n2008\\nPacific! - Runway To Elsewhere (Breakbot Remix)\\nPacific! - Hold Me (Breakbot Remix)\\nMetronomy - A Thing For Me (Breakbot Version)\\nLate Of The Pier - Bathroom Gurgle (Breakbot Remix)\\nFatlip - What\\'s Up Fatlip?

       " 'Brenda Holloway (born June 21, 1946 in Atascadero, California) is an African-American singer and songwriter best known for her period as a recording artist for the Motown label during the 1960s. Her best known hits from her Motown days were the soul ballad Every Little Bit Hurts (which reached #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1964. The title of the song was similar to the 60\\'s television public service announcement about highway littering--Every Litter Bit Hurts.  After her \\'64 hit, she recorded, When I\\'m Gone,which had been recorded by Mary Wells and was intended to be Mary\\'s followup to her \\'64 mega-hit , My Guy. However, after a contract dispute, Mary Wells left Motown for 20th Century Fox Records. Brenda\\'s version of \"When I\\'m Gone\" was a R&B hit, but never crossed over in the days of segragated R&B/Rock & Roll radio. \\n\\nHolloway did not fit the Motown mold well. She lived in Los Angeles, not Detroit.  She also had a grittier edge than the typical polished Motown performer, and wrote songs as well as sang them, which was unprecedented for a female Motown artist.  Brenda Hollowy inspired many pop artists, including The Beatles who asked her to perform as the opening act on their 1965 tour of the U.S. She was the only female to open for them. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Brenda+Holloway\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Brenda K. Starr (b. Brenda Kaplan on 14 October 1966) is a pop/salsa singer from New York City, New York, United States who is best known for her 1988 hit single \"I Still Believe\". In recent years, Starr has switched her musical genre from pop music to salsa and has been nominated for two Grammy Awards for her salsa recordings.\\n\\nStarr was born as Brenda Kaplan to a Jewish American father, organist Harvey Kaplan (also known as Harvey Kaye of the 1960s band the Spiral Starecase) and a Puerto Rican Roman Catholic mother.\\n\\nIn the early 1980s, through a chance meeting with Harry Belafonte, Starr landed a role in his 1984 hip hop film, Beat Street. Starr\\'s appearance in the movie garnered attention, leading to a recording contract on Mirage Records, through Arthur Baker, who enlisted the help of two production teams to complete the album: Lotti Golden & Richard Scher, and Carl Sturken & Evan Rogers. The lead single, from (I Want Your Love) Starr\\'s debut album, \"Pickin\\' Up Pieces\" written by Arthur Baker and Lotti Golden was a local club sensation and national hit, peaking at #9 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play Charts and on the Maxi Single\\'s Chart. \"Pickin\\' Up Pieces\" also cracked the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs reaching number 83. \\n\\nStarr\\'s eponymous sophomore LP, released in 1987 on MCA, included, what is considered her signature song, the power ballad \"I Still Believe\", which peaked at number 13 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, becoming Starr\\'s first and only top 20 single on the Hot 100. In 1998, Mariah Carey covered the song, which peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified platinum by the RIAA. The album also contained the club/dance smash \"What You See is What You Get\". The album peaked at #58 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. Starr has had two top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100: \"I Still Believe\" (which peaked at #13) and \"What You See is What You Get\" (which peaked at #24 and at #6 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play.\\n\\nHer song \"Sweet Surrender\" was included in the soundtrack for the 1988 teen film License to Drive starring Corey Haim. Her Song \"Sata\" was on the soundtrack for the 1990 film Lambada. During the late 1980s, Mariah Carey sang background vocals for Starr, and Starr helped Carey secure a recording contract by giving a demo tape of hers to Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola at a party. By 1991, Mariah Carey had become Sony/Columbia\\'s star attraction, which caused Starr\\'s career to shrink in terms of commercial success.[citation needed] After being dropped from Sony/Columbia Records for lackluster sales of her second album, By Heart, Starr worked odd jobs to support herself and her family for several years, including one at a shopping mall in New Jersey.\\n\\nStarr successfully reinventing herself as a Salsa/Tropical and Latin Pop artist. After the release of her cover of Herida, (originally by Myriam Hernandez) which peaked at #16 on the Latin Pop Airplay and at #1 on the Latin Tropical/Salsa Airplay chart, she was on top again. Starr continued her success with a string of popular albums and chart hits.\\n\\nBrenda was also a disc jockey at MIX 102.7, WNEW-FM, where she presented a request program \"Under the Stars\", from 9 p.m. to midnight on Sunday nights before it changed formats. It appeared to have helped her music career since her concerts have begun to sell even stronger than before. The lead single from her seventh album, Atrevete a Olvidarme, titled, \"Tu Eres\" earned her a nomination by the Billboard Latin Music Awards in 2006.\\n\\nStarr has starred in several films, most notably in the 1980s urban film Beat Street, which had her portraying herself as a singer at an open-microphone audition.\\n\\nIn 2013, Starr returned with a bilingual cover of \"Yo Te Estraño Tanto\" (Miss You Like Crazy) which is a Batacha/Latin Pop song. She continues to be record and tour. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Brenda+K.+Starr\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Brenda Mae Tarpley (born December 11, 1944), known professionally as Brenda Lee is an American country-pop singer who was popular during the 1950s and 1960s. She was given the nickname Little Miss Dynamite after recording Dynamite in 1957, and in the 1960s she had more charted hits than any other woman. Her father was an excellent left-handed pitcher in the Army, and her mother had a Cherokee great-grandparent. She first attracted attention performing in country music venues and her first single, 1957’s “One Step at a Time,” was a country hit.\\n\\nLee was a musical prodigy and by the time she was two she would hear songs on the radio once and be able to whistle the complete tune. She was five years old when she started to gain wider attention when she won a local singing contest sponsored by the elementary schools. At age 11, she was offered a recording contract with Decca Records and released the song “Dynamite,” leading to her lifelong nickname, “Little Miss Dynamite.”\\n\\nLee was popular in the UK very early in her career, and her 1961 rockabilly release “Let’s Jump the Broomstick” did not chart in the US, but went to #12 in the UK. Her biggest hits during this time include a rockabilly version of the country classic “Jambalaya (On the Bayou),” “Sweet Nothin’s,” “I Want to Be Wanted,” “All Alone Am I,” and “Fool #1.”\\n\\nIn 1960, she recorded her signature song, “I’m Sorry,” which hit number one on the Billboard pop chart and was her first gold single. Her last top-10 single on the pop charts was 1963’s “Losing You,” while she continued to have other chart songs such as her 1966 song “Coming On Strong” and “Is It True?” in 1964.\\n\\nDuring the early 1970s, Lee re-established herself as a country music artist, and earned a string of Top 10 hits on the country charts. Her biggest selling track of her career is, oddly enough, a Christmas song: “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree.” It was released in 1958, but it sold only 5,000 copies. However, it eventually sold over five million copies and remains a perennial radio favorite each December. \\n\\nOver the ensuing years, Lee has continued to record and perform all around the world, previously cutting records in four different languages. She is a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame. In 1992, she recorded a duet with Willy DeVille; Chuck Berry also wrote a song about her. Lee has been married to Ronnie Shacklett since 1963, and they have two daughters and three grandchildren. She is the second recipient of the Jo Meador-Walker Lifetime Achievement award. \\n\\nThroughout her career, Brenda Lee has released 41 studio albums, 12 compilation albums, and over 100 singles. She has had numerous top twenty hits on the Billboard Hot 100, Country, and AC charts in the US, UK, and Canada. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Brenda+Lee\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Alfred Jesse Smith (born July 26, 1941 in Shreveport, Louisiana), better known by the stage name Brenton Wood, is an American singer and songwriter, best known for his two 1967 hits: Oogum Boogum Song and Gimme Little Sign.\\n\\nWhen he was a child his family moved west to San Pedro in Los Angeles, California. In his high school years his family relocated to nearby Compton, where Brenton became a member of the Compton High School track team and received several awards for his athletic achievements.\\n\\nFollowing his high school graduation, Wood enrolled in Compton College. Soon after he took the stage name Brenton Wood, possibly inspired by the wealthy Los Angeles enclave of Brentwood (some sources state that the name is in honor of his \"home county\"). During his period there his musical interests began to manifest themselves. He was inspired by Jesse Belvin and Sam Cooke, and he began cultivating his songwriting skills, also becoming an accomplished pianist.\\n\\nAfter signing with Double Shot Records he had a hit with \"The Oogum Boogum Song\" in the spring of 1967. It reached number 19 on the R&B charts and number 34 on the pop listing. His biggest hit came in September the same year. \"Gimme Little Sign\" hit #9 on the pop chart and also #19 on the R&B charts.

       " 'Some life-changing moments are only apparent in retrospect. Brett Eldredge recognized his as it was happening.\\n\\nThe Paris, IL, native was visiting Nashville for the first time early in his sophomore year at Chicago\\'s Elmhurst College. He was at the Station Inn, an historic bluegrass/country venue where many of the greats of both worlds have played. His cousin Terry, a veteran of Dolly Parton\\'s band and now a member of the Grascals, was playing with a band called the Sidemen, and a mesmerized Brett was in the crowd.\\n\\n\"There was something so real and truthful about the songs they were playing,\" he says. “What happened next came as a shock.”\\n\\n\"He asked me to come up on stage and told me to pick a song to play with the band,\" says Brett. I said, \\'Amarillo By Morning,\\' and when I heard that fiddle intro, chills shot up my spine. I sang it for the crowd there and it was a magical experience. That was the point where I thought, \\'This is it. This is something I\\'ve got to do.\\'\"\\n\\nBy the start of the next school year, he had transferred to Middle Tennessee State University and begun the round of writers\\' nights and writing appointments that led him eventually to a record deal.\\n\\tThe talent that let him turn that dream into reality—the depth of his writing and the sheer power of his smoky and expressive baritone—are both apparent in his first single. \"Raymond\" is the poignant tale of a nursing home employee mistaken by a patient with Alzheimer\\'s for her deceased son, who was killed at war. It is a song whose inspiring reaffirmation of their mutual humanity is affecting listeners deeply. The single rings true for Eldredge as his Grandmother currently struggles through the disease.\\n\\t\"There are a lot of things I\\'ll play live where people will say, \\'I like that,\\' or \\'That\\'s a really cool song,\\'\" Brett says, \"but when I do this one, I get the chance to tell people how special a thing it\\'s been in my life, and it always touches someone. A lot of people know someone with Alzheimer\\'s and people react in a really emotional way to it.\"\\n\\tBrett has earned a reputation as much for the strength of his writing as for his world-class voice. He and co-writer Pat McLaughlin landed a song called \"I Think I\\'ve Had Enough\" on Gary Allan\\'s latest album, Get Off On The Pain, and one of his frequent collaborators is Country Music Hall of Famer and Grand Ole Opry stalwart Bill Anderson.\\n\\t\"He\\'s one of my favorite people to write with,\" says Brett. \"I love the fact that he believes in country music so much, because it\\'s something I really believe in. My dream, as I find my place in country music, is one day to be an Opry member.\"\\n\\tBrett heard all kinds of music growing up, and became a particular fan of the classic pop singers he heard in his grandfather\\'s car.\\n\\t\"I heard a lot of Frank Sinatra, who is still a favorite of mine, and Ray Charles and Bobby Darin,\" he says. \"When my mother convinced me to sing \\'Mack The Knife\\' at a talent show, I got hooked on singing in public.\"\\n\\tThat was in Paris, a town of 9,000 with \"cornfields and factories and lake right in the middle.\" Brett, his older brother and his parents—a traveling grain salesman and a nurse—lived on the lake and, says Brett, \"We were on the water every day, from the time I was so little they could pull me on water skis in a paddle boat until I left for college at 18.\" Sports were a big part of his life, and he played basketball, baseball and football in high school.\\n\\tHe also sang everywhere he could, often the Big Band music of Sinatra, earning spending money and learning to work a stage. His appreciation for country music became a passion when he turned 16 and he and a friend rode around listening to a Brooks & Dunn greatest hits album.\\n\\t\"There was something about it that just struck me,\" he says. \"I couldn\\'t get enough of it. Ronnie Dunn is one of my favorite singers of all time—I love the soul in his voice—and one of the main reasons I got into this in the first place.\"\\n\\tBrett spent two years in Chicago, where his older brother lived, performing with a school jazz band and with a Big Band around the region.\\n\\t\"One of the coolest gigs,\" he says, \"was at the Field Museum, I was singing in front of a 12-piece band under this huge Tyrannosaurus Rex statue near some mammoths. It was quite the experience.\"\\n\\tThen came that fateful visit to Nashville and his transfer to MTSU. He studied classic country stylists like Ray Price and George Jones, and later Vince Gill, absorbing everything he could.\\n\\t\"I was driving back and forth Nashville every day from Murfreesboro, which is thirty miles away,\" he says. \"I had a guitar Terry had given me, which was originally a gift from Dolly, and I\\'d pretty much lock myself in my room and make myself learn songs. I would play writers\\' nights all around Nashville. There might be two people, there might be 40 or 50. I\\'d go play my songs and see what people liked and what they didn\\'t. I\\'d screw up royally in front of them, but I learned.\"\\n\\tHe earned a degree, which, he says, \"made Mom and Dad happy, and then I moved on to what I really wanted to do.\\n\\tA staff writer for hit producer/publisher Byron Gallimore heard him at a writers\\' night and introduced him to Byron, who signed him.\\n\\t\"I wrote for about two years, developing my craft and writing with everyone I could. In the beginning, Byron just let me kind of find myself, because that takes a while. As you write more you starting homing in on what you sound good on. Eventually, Byron said, \\'You\\'ve got something here\\' and we went in and started cutting songs. We did a showcase, and Carole Ann Mobley from Warner Music Nashville said, \\'We\\'ve gotta sign this kid\\'. Mobley and Craig Kallman then signed Brett to Atlantic Records, making him the first official signing for the new imprint.\\n\\tAs he worked with his band tightening his show, he was offered a particularly gratifying gig.\\n\\t\"I opened for Blake Shelton at The Ryman and it was the coolest experience. I flew back from this house gig and all of a sudden I\\'m thrown into playing the Mother Church of Country Music, something I always dreamed of doing. I was operating on almost no sleep, but stepping out on that stage where everybody who\\'s anybody in country music has been meant the world to me.\"\\n\\tHe remains active in sports, playing basketball and volleyball and playing on an intramural softball team in Nashville, and rooting for the Cubs and Bears. Meanwhile, he is dedicated to improving his craft.\\n\\t\"As a songwriter,\" he says, \"my aim is to portray a little bit of me and my life along with the stories of other people and turn them into something that can really touch somebody\\'s heart and soul. We sit down on Music Row every day and write songs and every once in a while a song like ‘Raymond’ comes from such a real place. I hope it\\'s that real to other people and that I can make them feel the way I felt when I wrote it and when I sing it.\"\\n\\tJudging from audience reaction, that’s exactly what he’s doing. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Brett+Eldredge\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Brian was born November 12, 1943, in Brooklyn/Queens, New York City, where his first musical experience ranged from church choir at nine, to clarinet and guitar, to his first local harmony group, the Delfis. In 1959, they cut a demo record and made the rounds of New York City record labels. Finally, with much persistence, after many closed doors, Brian was signed as a solo artist to a management contract, where he cut demos for band leader Sammy Kaye\\'s publishing company. Kapp Records heard a demo and signed Brian at age 16. That became his first record \"Rosemary\" and was followed that summer of 1960 by the now infamous \"Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini,\" which got a nod from Brian\\'s cousin by marriage, Larry, of The Three Stooges, on their local New York TV Show, Three Stooges Fun House, although they wouldn\\'t meet till eight years later in Hollywood. In 1961, the song was used as a successful brainwashing technique in the classic Billy Wilder movie comedy, \"One,Two,Three\" starring James Cagney. It was Brian\\'s first Gold Record, selling millions world wide and racing to #1 in the U.S. briefly edging ahead of Elvis\\' all time biggest hit, \"It\\'s Now Or Never,\" as well as reaching the top of the charts in Japan, where he toured and performed in a TV special.\\n\\nNot to be deterred, by this simple twist of fate, Brian quickly moved on to ABC Records, in 1961, sharing their short pop roster with The Impressions and Ray Charles, where he cut a string of chart records with the NY writing/production team of Gary Geld and Peter Udell. In 1961, the top twenty \"Let Me Belong To You\" and \"I\\'ll Never Stop Wanting You. Then in 1962, \"Ginny Come Lately,\" went to #21 in the U.S. while reaching #5 in England and top ten all over Europe. This was followed that same year by \"Sealed With A Kiss,\" reaching #3 in the U.S. and England, top ten in Germany, and another world wide hit. He also recorded German versions of both songs.\\n\\nBrian was constantly on the road, appearing on American Bandstand often, once hosting the show, as well as the Saturday Night Show, and many popular local TV music shows around the country, as he put on endless miles doing bus tours, including The Caravan of Stars (\"as many miles as anyone\" says Dick Clark) and one nighters. In 1963, he headlined a tour in England with Little Eva, appearing on TV shows Thank Your Lucky Stars and Jukebox Jury as well as the live BBC radio show Saturday Club, where he heard and became an early Beatles fan. And while doing several annual tours in South America with Neil Sedaka during Carnaval, he heard the early Bossa Nova artists. He was never without his acoustic Martin guitar and was always open to, and absorbing new musical influences and changes. \\n\\nHis following early \"country-rock\" chart singles (which John Fogerty told him were \"ahead of their time\") included in 1962, the #25 single \"Warmed Over Kisses (Left Over Love),\" \"I may Not Live To See Tomorrow\" and in 1963, \"I\\'m Afraid To Go Home.\" About this time, Brian performed an engagement in Greenwich Village at the Cafe Wha? with a young comedian named Richard Pryor. He then moved on to Philips Records, where in 1966 he recorded an album produced by Snuff Garrett with the musical assistance of now legendary musicians Leon Russell and JJ Cale, which included the top twenty singles, \"The Joker Went Wild\" and \"Run,Run,Look And See.\" He went on to record two albums and chart singles for DOT Records, including his 1969 hit remake of the Thomas Wayne song \"Tragedy.\" In 1970, Brian cut his third Gold Record with the Curtis Mayfield/Impressions song \"Gypsy Woman,\" which went to #3 in the U.S. and sold well over 3 million internationally, followed by his tenth album with six original songs and another hit single, a version of Jackie Wilson\\'s classic \"Lonely Teardrops,\" which he co-wrote or co-produced with Del Shannon on UNI Records.\\n\\nVocally & artistically Brian is called \"chameleonesque\" for all his musical changes, having produced Hits for five different labels & successfully recorded everything from Novelty to Pop Ballads; to Folk Rock and Country Rock; to Pop Rock and Pop Soul, over more than a decade, but quite modestly having spent more than half of his life on the road and in the studio both writing and living his music, Brian feels he has just begun to Rock! In 1975, while on a tour of Indian Country in the Southwest with the Native American rock group XIT, he learned that ABC/Anchor Records in England had reissued his original recording of \"Sealed With A Kiss\" b/w \"Ginny Come Lately,\" due to popular demand, and it surprised everyone by becoming a hit again, thirteen years later, the second time around!..going to #7 in England as well as charting again in Europe.\\nIn the late seventies, with songwriting partner Rosmari, he turned his focus to writing and they spent a couple of years in New Orleans working with legendary writer/producer/artist, Allen Toussaint, which resulted in the album \"In A State Of Bayou\" on Private Stock Records, including three original songs. He later recorded a couple of original songs with help from members of The Band, Rick Danko and Garth Hudson at their Malibu studio, Shangri-La, and then joined Rick on one of his solo shows. In the early 1980\\'s Brian\\'s recording of \"Ginny Come Lately\" was included on the soundtrack album Lemon Popsicle 5 from the British movie Baby Love. The release in Germany of \"Brian Hyland, Original Favorites\" LP/CSS, was a partial collection of his Hit singles, however after twenty seven years Rhino Records released the first Brian Hyland Greatest Hits on LP/CSS in March of 1987. It includes fourteen of the twenty-two hot 100 chart singles Brian scored over an eleven year period from 1960 to 1971.

       " 'Brian McKnight (born June 5, 1969 in Buffalo, New York) is an American singer, songwriter, arranger, producer and one of the prominent singers of his years, specializing in pop and R&B. He is a multi-instrumentalist and plays the piano, guitar, and trumpet.\\n\\nEmbracing an effortless eloquence and cocoa butter smooth persona, the music of Brian McKnight has defined the true meaning of an American soul-man since 1991. Like his spiritual Motown godfathers, this upstate New York native has a velvety voice and silky style that captures the vibe of vintage soul without being old fashion. On his latest disc Ten, that blend can be clearly heard.\\n\\nWhile Brian’s aspirations might have seemed like a lofty ambition, the longevity of his career is a testament to the purity of his vision. With the release of Ten, McKnight’s first disc for his new label Warner Bros Records, the Grammy-nominated singer could not be more pleased with the outcome. Without a doubt, the landscape of soul music has gotten younger, but that fact did not hinder McKnight’s creative process. \\n\\nAfter 16 million albums sold since his self-titled debut, it would have been too easy for McKnight to simply follow the R&B template of rote romanticism. But on Ten, the artist in him felt the need to be more revealing. Though McKnight has been friends with producers Tim & Bob for over ten years, this is the trio’s first collaboration.\\n\\nThough Brian has never been the kind of singer/songwriter that one would call political that didn’t stop him from penning “Red, White & Blue,” a heart wrenching ode for the men and women currently at war, teaming up with country star Rascal Flatts.\\n\\nCurrently working on a variety of projects including a talk show and soundtracks for two upcoming Tyler Perry projects, the veteran soul singer could not be happier with the outcome of Ten. For fans of real music, Ten is the perfect addition to the soul cannon.\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Brian+McKnight\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Brian Protheroe (born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 16 June 1944) is an English musician and actor. \\n\\nBorn to a Welsh father and English mother, Protheroe joined a local church choir when he was 12 years old and started piano lessons at about the same time. The music of Cliff Richard and the Shadows inspired him to start learning the guitar. He joined a rock band called The Coasters as lead singer in 1961 and also joined an amateur theatre group called The Studio Theatre at around the same time.\\n \\nFirst job was a library assistant for a year followed by three years as a student technician in a hospital pathological laboratory.\\n \\nMusical influences around this time were Elvis Presley, The Everly Brothers, Josh White, Big Bill Broonzy, Sonny Terry and Brownie Mcghee, Dave Brubeck, and the choral church music of Bach.\\n \\nBrian joined the folk group, Folk Blues Incorporated (FBI) when he was 19, while at this time listening to Bob Dylan and especially The Beatles.\\n \\nHe came to London with FBI in 1965 and played in folk clubs in and around London.\\n \\n\"The three of us lived in one room of a flat in south London owned by a blues singer called Gerry Lockran. We had no money and lived fairly rough for about three months before we gave it up and went home. During this time we met Paul Simon who was playing the same clubs as us.\"\\n \\nIn 1966, Brian began his career as an actor. His first job was with his local repertory theatre in Salisbury. He worked there for about 7 months then spent the next 5 years in various theatre companies around England, developing his musical skills as well as becoming an experienced actor.\\n \\nIn 1968 he worked for nearly two years in a theatre company in Lincoln in north east England where he met Martin Duncan who was also a musician, writer and actor. Over the next few years they collaborated on various musical and artistic projects.\\n \\n\"When we wrote together Martin would usually write the lyrics and I would set them to music. I was quite conventional in my approach to song writing but Martin had a more anarchic style and a wonderful surreal sense of humour that would force me into unusual musical forms.\"\\n \\nDuring 1973 Brian lived in a flat in London\\'s Covent Garden.\\n \\n\"I wasn\\'t working much as an actor and wasn\\'t in a relationship at the time but was writing the occasional song. I wrote a song called \"Pinball\" one weekend about my life at the time and made a simple home demo of it along with a couple of other songs.\"\\n \\nLater in 1973 Brian was playing the part of a pop singer in a play called \"Death on Demand\" when a representative from Chrysalis Records heard a song he had written for the show.\\n \\n\"He asked if I had any other material so I played him my home demos. He liked them and I was offered a recording contract.\"\\n \\nBrian\\'s first single, \"Pinball\" was released in August 1974 followed by Pinball. This was followed over the next couple of years by two more albums - \"Pick-Up\" and \"I/You.\"\\n \\nBrian\\'s acting career continued and in 1976 he starred in the London Production of the rock musical, \"Leave Him to Heaven\" at the New London theatre.\\n\\nBasta Records collected his first three albums, remastered and released them as a box set with a \"new\" disc of unreleased material. The package was called \"Brian\\'s Big Box\" and was the first time his material was available in more than two decades.\\n\\nWith the development of the internet, his recordings became more available to the fans that remembered him from the 70s, and he is enjoying a resurgence in popularity and has begun recording again.\\n\\nThe 2005 album \"Citysong\" was released by Basta as \"Brian Protheroe\\'s New Single and 17 Bonus Tracks.\" It also included two homemade movies to accompany the single. It was also released on iTunes.\\n\\nIn 2006, EMI released \"Pinball and Other Stories,\" a career retrospective, with the included tracks having been remastered at Abbey Road studios.\\n \\nHis personal web page includes his extensive Theater/TV/Movie experience.\\n \\nAs a pianist Brian is a big follower of Dr. John and Randy Newman.\\n\\nEvery Roman Knows! is the official BP fan page. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Protheroe\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Brian Douglas Wilson (born June 20, 1942 in Inglewood, California) is an American singer-songwriter, producer, and musician, best known for being the principal songwriter and co-lead singer for The Beach Boys, co-founded with brothers Carl and Dennis. Once known for his iconic falsetto, much of Brian\\'s most well-known work is tinged with melancholy and existentialism. Due to his unorthodox approach to composition, arrangement, and recording, Brian is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and influential creative forces in popular music.\\n\\nThe first official release credited to Wilson as a solo artist was the 1966 Beach Boys single \"Caroline, No\" (b/w \"Summer Means New Love\"), due to being the single\\'s arranger and sole vocal presence. Around the same time, Wilson also produced cuts for other artists such as The Beach Boys\\' spear counterpart The Honeys (member Marilyn Rovell was Wilson\\'s first wife), and Jan & Dean, whose \"Surf City\" became a #1 hit single. The 1977 album Love You and the unreleased Adult/Child (recorded during the same sessions) were tentatively considered for release as Brian Wilson solo albums, although the idea fell through. Love You would be last Beach Boys albums to feature Wilson\\'s extended involvement for the better part of 35 years.\\n\\nBrian\\'s solo career, despite a few false starts, began in earnest with the 1987 single \"Let\\'s Go to Heaven in My Car\" (b/w \"Too Much Sugar\"), featured in the film Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol. A year later, his debut solo album, the eponymous Brian Wilson, was released, at the time hailed as a 1980s equivalent of what is widely regarded as Wilson\\'s magnum opus, 1966\\'s Pet Sounds. A follow-up in much the same vein, Sweet Insanity, was scrapped due to various personal issues.\\n\\nAlso left on the shelf was a fruitful collaborative project with multi-instrumentalist Andy Paley, informally known as \"The Paley Sessions\". Over the years, a few tracks were released through various albums, but dozens more have been bootlegged, and a comprehensive release has yet to be assembled. \\n\\nInstead, 1995 saw the release of two albums: I Just Wasn\\'t Made for These Times, a collection of re-recordings seemingly meant to reintroduce him to the public, and Orange Crate Art, a song cycle written by one-time lyricist Van Dyke Parks with contributions by Wilson, were released. An album of new compositions entitled Imagination followed in 1998. \\n\\nWilson began performing live again in 1999, and with his confidence as a performer growing ever stronger, he chose to release a live album documenting the Imagination tour (Live at the Roxy Theatre).  In 2002, he began incorporating Pet Sounds in its entirety into his live performances; this, too, was documented in a live album titled Pet Sounds Live.\\n\\nIn 2004, Wilson revived and completed SMiLE, his unfinished 1967 album, performing the work in its entirety on a celebrated tour. The positive response lead him to record a studio version which met similar acclaim; the album cut \"Mrs. O\\'Leary\\'s Cow\" won a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental. That same year, he released Gettin\\' in Over My Head (containing many songs originating with the ill-fated Sweet Insanity album), featuring guest musicians Elton John, Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, and brother Carl, who passed away in 1998. Brian\\'s song \"Lay Down Burden\" was written in tribute of his brother.\\n\\nBrian released a collection of Christmas songs entitled What I Really Want For Christmas in 2005. His 2008 album, That Lucky Old Sun, marked his return to Capitol Records. As part of a two-album deal with Disney, Wilson released Reimagines Gershwin (2010), a tribute to his idol George Gershwin, and In the Key of Disney (2011), a collection of cover songs from various Disney films.\\n\\n2012 saw the The Beach Boys celebrate their 50th anniversary, reuniting a majority of surviving band members including Brian, for a worldwide tour as well as the release of an album, That\\'s Why God Made the Radio, composed almost entirely by Wilson with an assortment of co-writers. The album became the group\\'s biggest chart success in decades, peaking at #3 on the Billboard album charts. Status quo was restored as the group members went their separate ways again after the conclusion of the tour.\\n\\nIn 2015, Wilson released his eleventh studio album, No Pier Pressure. Originally conceived as a follow-up to That\\'s Why God Made the Radio before The Beach Boys reunion fell through, the album features guest appearances by contemporary artists such as Kacey Musgraves, She & Him, and Nate Ruess (of fun.), as well as former Beach Boys Al Jardine, Blondie Chaplin, and David Marks.  Summer 2015 will also see the public release of Wilson\\'s autobiographical motion picture Love and Mercy (named after Wilson\\'s  1988 comeback single), with actors Paul Dano and John Cusack starring as a younger and older Wilson. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Wilson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Brigitte Bardot (French pronunciation: bʁiʒit baʁdo) (born 28 September 1934) is a French actress, former fashion model, singer and animal welfare/rights activist.\\n\\nShe participated in various musical shows and recorded many popular songs in the 1960s and 1970s, mostly in collaboration with Serge Gainsbourg, Bob Zagury and Sacha Distel, including \"Harley Davidson\", \"Je Me Donne A Qui Me Plait\", \"Bubble gum\", \"Contact\", \"Je Reviendrais Toujours Vers Toi\", \"L\\'Appareil A Sous\", \"La Madrague\", \"On Demenage\", \"Sidonie\", \"Tu Veux, Ou Tu Veux Pas?\", \"Le Soleil De Ma Vie\" (the cover of Stevie Wonder\\'s \"You Are the Sunshine of My Life\") and notorious \"Je t\\'aime… moi non plus\".\\n\\nIn 1952, she appeared on screen for the first time in Le Trou Normand. That same year, at age 18, she married director Roger Vadim, with whom she had been romantically involved for several years.\\n\\nAlthough the European film industry was then in the ascendant, her personal rise was remarkable: she has been one of the few European actresses to receive mass media attention in the United States. She and Marilyn Monroe were the icons of female sexuality in the 1950s and 1960s and whenever she made public appearances in the United States the media hordes covered her every move.\\n\\nHer films of the early and mid 1950s were lightweight romantic dramas, some of them historical, in which she was cast as ingénue or siren, often with an element of undress. She played bit parts in three English-language films, the British comedy Doctor at Sea (1955), Helen of Troy (1954), in which she was understudy for the title-role but only appears as Helen\\'s handmaid, and Act of Love (1954) with Kirk Douglas. Her French-language films were dubbed for international release. \"She is every man\\'s idea of the girl he\\'d like to meet in Paris\" said the film-critic Ivon Addams in 1955.\\n\\nVadim was not content with this light fare. The New Wave of French and Italian art directors and their stars were riding high internationally and he felt Bardot was being undersold. Looking for something more like an art-film to push her as a serious actress, he showcased her in And God Created Woman (1956) with Jean-Louis Trintignant.\\n\\nThe film, about an amoral teenager in a respectable small-town setting, was a big international success. She may have had an affair with her co-star Trintignant, but this was more likely a pre-release publicity gimmick. The film is often wrongly described as her first film (it was her seventeenth) and to have launched her overnight, but it did help move her towards the cinematic mainstream.\\n\\nIt also ruled out a transition to Hollywood, where she was thought too risqué to handle. The Doris Day era was in still in full swing and even Jane Russell in The French Line (1953) had been thought to be going too far by showing her midriff. Erotica like Bardot\\'s Cette sacrée gamine (That Crazy Kid, 1955) was considered fine at the box-office as long as it was clearly labelled \"European\". Bardot\\'s limited English and strong accent, while beguiling to the ears of men, did not suit rapid-fire Hollywood scripts. In any event, staying in Europe benefited her image when the 1960s began to swing and Hollywood slipped into the background for a while, and Bardot was voted honorary sex-goddess of the decade.\\n\\nDivorced from Vadim in 1957, she married actor Jacques Charrier (1959-62), by whom in 1960 she had her only child, Nicolas-Jacques Charrier from whom she is estranged. She once referred to her only child as \"a tumour\". The marriage was preyed on by the paparazzi and there were clashes over the direction of Bardot\\'s career. Her films became more substantial, but this brought a heavy pressure of dual celebrity as she sought critical acclaim while remaining to most of the world a glamour model.\\n\\nVie privée (1960), directed by Louis Malle has more than an element of autobiography in it. The scene in which, returning to her flat, Bardot\\'s character is harangued in the lift by a middle-aged cleaning-lady calling her a tramp and a tart was based on an actual incident, and is a resonant image of celebrity in the mid-20th century.\\n\\nSoon after, Bardot withdrew to the seclusion of Southern France and is now known to have attempted suicide, but as the sexual revolution of the early 1960s gathered momentum her lifestyle began to seem more like the norm and the pressure lifted. Through the sixties, she was happy to appear in glossy star-vehicles like Viva Maria (1969), to dabble in pop music and to play the role of glamour model and icon. In 1965 she appeared as herself in the Hollywood production Dear Brigitte starring Jimmy Stewart.\\n\\nHer other husbands were German millionaire playboy Gunter Sachs (1966-69), and French right-wing politician, Bernard d\\'Ormale (1992-present). She has also had reputed relationships with many men including singers Serge Gainsbourg and Sacha Distel. In the late 1950s, she shared an exchange she considered “croiser de deux sillages” with writer John Gilmore, then an actor in France for a New Wave film to have starred Jean Seberg. Gilmore told Paris Match, “I felt a beautiful warmth with Bardot but found it difficult to discuss things to any depth whatsoever”.\\n\\nShe is recognised for popularising bikini swimwear in early films such as Manina (Woman without a Veil, 1952) and in her appearances at Cannes and in many photo shoots. She even sported an early version of the monokini from time to time. Though this was not considered extraordinary in France, it was considered nearly scandalous in the US. The fashions of the 1960s looked effortlessly right and spontaneous on her and she joined Marilyn Monroe and Jackie Kennedy, in becoming a subject for Andy Warhol paintings.\\n\\nIn 1970, the sculptor Alain Gourdon used Bardot as the model for a bust of Marianne, the French national emblem.\\n\\nMentions of Bardot in music\\nThe first song to reference Brigitte Bardot was \"Gimme\\' that Wine\" by vocalese group Lambert, Hendricks and Ross on the Columbia label in 1960.\\n\\nIndie singer Jordan Galland also has a song called \"Brigitte Bardot\". In 1966, Harry Belafonte recorded \"Zombie Jamboree\" which has an entire verse dedicated to Brigitte Bargot.\\n\\nBardot has also been referenced in many other songs, including \"I Shall Be Free\" (Bob Dylan), \"We Didn\\'t Start the Fire\" (Billy Joel), \"Message of Love\" (The Pretenders), \"I Think I\\'m Going To Kill Myself\" (Elton John), \"Warlocks\" (Red Hot Chili Peppers), \"You Went The Wrong Way, Old King Louie\" (Allan Sherman), \"You\\'re My Favourite Star\" (The Bellamy Brothers), \"It\\'s Not Enough\" (The Who), \"Contempt\" (Silkworm), \"Big Wedge\" (Fish),\"Brigitte Bardot\" (Tom Zé), \"Alegria, Alegria\" (Caetano Veloso), \"Loaded\" (ZZ Top), \"Brigitte Bardot\" (Creature), \"Bardot\" (Marden Hill), \"Shir Nevu\\'i Cosmi Aliz\" (Yoni Rechter & Eli Mohar), \"Smiles Like Richard Nixon\" (The Bad Examples), \"Bijou\" (Stew), \"Stratford-On-Guy\" (Liz Phair), and \"Brigitte Bardot T.N.T.\" (Pizzicato Five). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Brigitte+Bardot\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Brittany Nicole Waddell, better known by her stage name as Britt Nicole is a Christian pop artist.\\nWaddell began singing at the age of three in her home church, Truth Temple of (Kannapolis, North Carolina). She, along with her brother and cousin, eventually became involved with the church\\'s daily program on Charlotte TV station WAXN.\\n\\nWaddell turned down a scholarship from Belmont University in Nashville Tennessee to pursue a full-time music career, she felt that God called her to not go to college but to concentrate on music instead In 2004 she signed a management deal with Vertical Entertainment and then signed a development - dealing with Word Records Sparrow Records signed her in 2006 and her first album Say It was released May 22, 2007 Britt Nicole was committed to the Winter Jam Tour with Sanctus Real, Hawk Nelson Jeremy Camp and Steven Curtis Chapman Newsong [1] \\n\\nA native of Salisbury, NC, Britt has always had a heart for reaching people and has long used music as the vehicle to change lives.  She began singing in church at age three and by the time she was in high school, was appearing on her church’s daily television program and logged a performance at New York’s famed Carnegie Hall with her school’s advanced chorus.\\n\\nThose early pursuits paved the way for her to sign with Sparrow Records in 2006.  She burst on the charts a year later with her label debut, “Say It,” a finely crafted pop collection that introduced us to her engaging voice and thought-provoking lyrics.  It earned her a slot on the Winter Jam tour that year with Steven Curtis Chapman, Jeremy Camp, NewSong and Hawk Nelson where she developed a reputation as a compelling live performer.\\n\\nIt was a whirlwind existence that found her looking to meet the needs of those around her—whether it was a girl in a youth group who needed someone to pray with or a parent seeking advice on their troubled teen.  Her servant’s heart and earnest desire to fill others up soon left Britt herself feeling empty.  It all caught up with her at an Alabama youth conference called The Ramp.  “I went with my youth group as a youth leader to support and pray for them, but near the end of the event, I was kind of worn out and I began saying ‘Okay God, I just really need You to come and do something in my life,’” Britt recalls.  She got her answer as she was driving back to Nashville.\\n\\n“I just felt different. I felt like the old me was gone and God had started to show me who I really was and what I was called to do,” Britt says.  “As I was driving home from the conference, everywhere I would stop, whether at a gas station or a restaurant, God was challenging me to step out and tell people about Him and His love for them.  There are so many hurting and broken people around us each day and God was showing me the importance of reaching out to them just as He would.  In the past, I have often let the fear of people and their opinions stop me from being who I am.  At the core though, I know who I am and who God has called me to be.  In letting go of my past, I was able to move forward, and instead of focusing on all my mistakes and failures, I started focusing on those around me.  That’s ultimately why I’m here, to worship God and to reach those who need to know Him.”\\n\\nAfter that experience, she wrote songs for the new album that included “The Lost Get Found,” “Walk on the Water,” and “Safe.”  Britt continues to explain that, “They all have a similar message of having the courage to step out in faith and walk in what God has called you to do even when it’s scary.  I don’t want to be selfish anymore.  I don’t want to be safe anymore.  When God tells me to step out and talk to somebody or believe for what seems impossible, I want to do it.”\\n\\nThe new album combines compelling lyrics with catchy pop songs that linger in your head such as the funky “How We Roll” and the infectious groove of “Headphones.”  “When I write songs, I often write to specific people,” she reveals.  “The first verse of ‘Headphones’ was written to a girl that I know.  She’s in middle school dealing with the pressure of fitting in.  I wanted to remind her that she does not have to look or be like anyone else because God loves her and made her just the way she is.  Sometimes it is hard to stand out and sometimes you feel alone when you do, but I know she is being a light to so many and that’s what matters.”\\n\\n“Feel the Light” is another song that was written for a specific friend of hers who had faced several difficult things as a child.  “She was hiding all of her pain and had never told anyone what she was going through,” shares Britt.  “Sometimes it’s easier to hide our fears, our struggles, and things that have happened to us in our past rather than talk about them.  A lot of kids I meet feel they have no one to talk to who will understand, but God promises us that when we bring everything into His light, He will heal us and we will be free.”  One of her favorite lines in the song is “you’re a queen, but you’ve never known it.”  She explains that, “The important thing to remember is that your past does not define who you are.  We all go through hard things, but it is our choice to decide how we deal with them.  The song simply says, ‘Let go and feel the light.’”\\n\\nOne of the most personal songs on the new record is “Have Your Way”.  “I was thinking about my brother when I wrote the song, but when I sang it in the studio, it somehow hit even closer to home,” says Britt.  “I was also reminded of Job in the Bible when I wrote the lyrics.  He went through so many things and everything was taken from him, but at the end of it all, he still fell to his knees and worshiped God and never turned his back on Him.  He just said, ‘God have Your way, whatever You want.’  I want to be like that.”  Through Britt’s achingly vulnerable vocals, you can sense the more personal nature of the song as she sings, “you never said the road would be easy, but you said you would never leave.”  “The night I sang it in the studio, I sang it laying down,” says Britt.  “I’ve never sung a vocal like that.  I always sing standing up in a vocal booth, which makes it feel more like a performance.  When I’m praying or just spending time with God, I’m usually on the floor so it just naturally felt more like I was singing to God.”\\n\\nIn listening to Britt Nicole’s music, it’s obvious she possesses wisdom beyond her years and a spiritual maturity not often seen in one so young.  Yet she’s very much the playful girl next door and those equally intriguing sides of her personality merge seamlessly on “The Lost Get Found.”\\n\\n “My fans want a pop record,” she says wistfully.  “I’m a pop artist and they love fun music.  When they come to my concerts, they want to have fun and I love that.  That’s in my personality to have fun, but the heart of who I am is to worship and to see people’s lives changed and to reach those who are hurting.  It’s what I believe God has called me to do.”\\n\\nSalisbury, North Carolina, United States2007 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Britt+Nicole\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Brook Benton (born Benjamin Franklin Peay on September 19, 1931; died April 9, 1988) was an American singer and songwriter who was popular with rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and pop music audiences during the late 1950s and early 1960s, when he scored hits such as \"It\\'s Just a Matter of Time\" and \"Endlessly\", many of which he co-wrote.\\n\\nWhen Benton was young he enjoyed gospel music and wrote songs and in 1948 he went to New York to pursue his music career. \\n\\nHe was a member of several gospel groups including \"The Langfordairies\", \"The Jerusalem Stars\", and \"The Golden Gate Quartet\". \\n\\nAfter returning to his home state he joined a R&B singing group, \"the Sandmen\", and soon went back to New York to try for a big break. Eventually the record company decided to drop The Sandmen and push Brook as a solo artist.\\n\\nBenton wrote songs for artists such as Nat King Cole, Clyde McPhatter, and Roy Hamilton. Soon he released his first minor hit A Million Miles From Nowhere, and later he joined the Mercury label, which would later bring him big success.\\n\\nIn 1952 he got his big break with It\\'s Just a Matter of Time and Endlessly. \\n\\nIt\\'s Just a Matter of Time made it to #3 on the U.S. Pop charts, while Endlessly made it to #12 .

       " 'In 2005, fans and critics alike were enthralled by music sensation Brooke Valentine, aka B. Valentine. It was her dynamic single, \"Girlfight\" featuring Lil Jon and Big Boi, taken from her debut full-length project, Chain Letter (Subliminal Entertainment/Virgin Records), that helped propel album sales to 2.5 million copies worldwide. Now, she is back, simply as B. Valentine—with a new focus, a higher sense of purpose, and most of all, exciting new music!\\n\\nB. Valentine is ecstatic about the release of her long-awaited album and its upbeat title track single,   “Forever”—her first collection of all-new material in four years. The album is a celebration of life, family, and B. Valentine’s new-found freedom. She does not completely shed her sexy and fun-girl image, but the tragic loss of a family member, taking time to focus on being a new Mom, and a long battle to be released from Virgin Records certainly have affected her perspective.\\n\\n“A lot of fans have been asking where I have been,” she says, referring to her extended hiatus from the music business. “You know, I’ve been singing since I was 12 years-old; so by the time songs like ‘Girlfight’ and the Chain Letter album hit, I’d been doing this for quite a while. In this world, you just can’t have all career and no balance.  I gave birth to my son London, who I love and adore. He requires a bit more attention than what the average parent has to give to a child. I’d been fighting to be released from the deal with Virgin Records. I was no longer in love with the industry and with the politics that go with it. I needed a break. I needed to live life. But I want my fans to know, though, that I never fell out of love with music or creating it.  I was always appreciative of their support and what they have meant to my career.”\\n\\nReleased in February/March 2012, Forever is a musically ambitious and cohesive project. Yet there was no original intention to even create an album, according to B. Valentine. The writing and production of Forever was very organic, she says. “It was me going into the studio and writing whenever I felt like it. It was almost like an accident, but it was meant to be. At the end of the day I had these songs I didn’t want to let go of. I didn’t want to sell them. I didn’t want other artists to have them either because they were so personal to me.” [Subliminal Entertainment CEO] Deja the Great and I did all of the writing. He did all of the production.”\\n\\nForever is a composite of Dance, R&B and Pop elements; featuring dazzling club anthems, powerful R&B joints, emotive ballads and mid-tempo songs. The album is an expression of\\n\\nB. Valentine’s life experiences. “I’ve always written from the heart, but my earlier experiences weren’t like this,” she says. “Just looking at my son London and then putting pen to paper is so different and so deep. I’m older now. I’m a grown woman. I’m going to reach people with my music in a new and different way. This music isn’t about just making you want to dance in a club, but making you want to dance for life.”\\n\\nWith total balance and commitment to both family and her music career, B. Valentine is BACK! And this time, Forever! <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Brooke+Valentine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Sheryl Suzanne Crow (born February 11, 1962) is an American blues rock singer, guitarist, bassist, pianist and songwriter. Her music blends country, pop, folk, and blues rock into one mainstream sound, and she has won nine Grammy Awards. Crow is also a noted political activist.\\n\\nCrow was born in Kennett, Missouri. Her parents were members of a local big band in which her father, an attorney, played trumpet. The family was very musical and owned three pianos.\\n\\nIn school, she was active in choir, athletics, and school plays. Even at a young age she was a perfectionist who strived to please her parents. In high school she was a drum majorette, member of the Pep Club, the National Honor Society, Future Farmers of America, Freshman Maid, Senior Maid and Paperdoll Queen. When her prom date was later questioned about her fame he said that at the time he thought she \"would be a doctor\\'s wife someday\". She graduated in 1984 from the University of Missouri where she majored in music education with a concentration in piano. Coincidentally, actor Brad Pitt and ABC-TV news anchor Elizabeth Vargas were also students at the University of Missouri at the same time Crow was studying there; however, it is unknown whether or not any of these three future celebrities actually knew each other while they were students.\\n\\nFollowing college she became an elementary school music teacher in a suburb of St. Louis where she could be located closer to her fiance. Teaching during the day allowed her the opportunity to sing in bands on the weekends. Many people who knew her socially then, describe her as a nice, kind, elementary school teacher whose goal was settling down to raise children. At times, they acknowledge, she also struggled to get by on a teacher\\'s salary. Other than comments about wanting to go to California someday and \"make it\", and her weekend band gigs, few during this period of her life saw the relentless determination that would someday carry her to multi-millionaire rock stardom. Or if they saw it, they didn\\'t realize they were witnessing a future rock star in training. This time in her life, in retrospect, might accurately be considered by those who knew her then as her \"wilderness years.\"\\n\\nAfter a couple years of teaching and healing from a broken engagement, she was introduced to a local musician/producer. He had a thriving studio in the basement of his parent\\'s home and helped her by using her in advertising jingles. Her first jingle was a back-to-school spot for the St. Louis department store Famous-Barr. McDonald\\'s and Toyota commercial jingles soon followed. She was recently quoted in her 60 Minutes segment as saying she made $50,000 on her McDonald\\'s commercial alone. This success spurred her into thinking what she could possibly do if she went into music full time.\\n\\nMotivated by her new-found success, Crow decided to move to Los Angeles in 1986. Using her demo jingle tapes from St. Louis and perservering through constant rejections, she eventually found work as a backup vocalist for many major label acts. She was recruited to perform as a backup singer for Michael Jackson on his Bad tour. Whether she actually crashed the audition, as widely reported at the time, is uncertain. She spent the next 17 months touring the world singing back up and a duet, \"I Just Can\\'t Stop Loving You\" on stage with Jackson. After the tour ended in 1989, she sang back up for Don Henley and in the following year made her first appearance on Saturday Night Live singing back up (\"time, time, take it, take it away\") for Henley. Later she credited Henley for helping her write better songs.\\n\\nIn 1989, she played keyboards in the touring version of Toy Matinee, which was led by her boyfriend at the time, Kevin Gilbert.\\n\\nBy 1990, Crow had attracted the attention of A&M Records, eventually leading to her debut album which remains unreleased but widely bootlegged to this day. However, she did not like the slick and well-produced pop sound of the record and implored the label to allow her to start anew. What followed was months of depression that was mentioned years later in People magazine where she stated she felt her career was over. She eventually teamed up professionally with producer Bill Bottrell.\\n\\nCrow became acquainted with a song writing collective known as \"The Tuesday Night Music Club\" through Bottrell, a member of the club; and dated another member, Kevin Gilbert. There has been much controversy surrounding the credit for Crow\\'s album Tuesday Night Music Club. While Crow has publicly taken credit for much of the album, most notably on The Late Show with David Letterman, members of The Tuesday Night Music Club have disputed this. David Baerwald, a member of TNMC, stated that, ``Everybody was equal, except Sheryl. She wasn\\'t one of us. We helped her make a record.\"[1] Crow later acrimoniously split with most of the musicians in the collective and only Bottrell was involved in her follow-up album. Gilbert wrote a number of memorably excoriating songs such as Leaving Miss Broadway with lines such as And I know that you believe each new invention of the truth and I saw you on my TV taking credit for my work / And I knew if I said anything that I would be the jerk / There\\'s always some ex-boyfriend, some jealous has-been clown / Trying to muscle in the spotlight, trying to keep the lady down.\\n\\nGilbert also struck back at Crow by re-recording their song Strong Enough under the name Keta Men as a fey, Village People-like disco anthem that was featured on the Dance Across the Universe collection on Universal Records.\\n\\nThis creative period resulted in her debut album, called Tuesday Night Music Club. She appeared in the New Faces section of Rolling Stone the summer of 1993. The album featured many of the songs written by Crow and her friends, including the first single, Leaving Las Vegas. The album was slow to garner attention until All I Wanna Do became an unexpected smash radio hit in the spring of 1994. As she later stated in People Magazine, she found an old poetry book in a used book store in the L.A. area and used a poem as lyrics in the song. To her and Bottrell\\'s credit, they tracked down the author (Wyn Cooper) and according to People magazine, he ended up being paid over $50,000 in royalties. The singles Run, Baby, Run and Strong Enough were also released. Crow received several Grammy awards in 1994: Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for All I Wanna Do; Record of the Year for All I Wanna Do; and Best New Artist. The album, which sold 7 million copies, was controversial in that there were disputes among the other Tuesday Night Music Club members about not being fairly credited for their contributions.\\n\\nIn 1996 Crow released her self-titled second album, which earned her the cover of Rolling Stone. The album was darker and grittier and far more political, with songs about abortion (Hard to Make A Stand), homelessness and nuclear war. The debut single If It Makes You Happy became a radio hit, and netted her two Grammy awards for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Rock Album. Other singles included A Change Would Do You Good, Home and Everyday is a Winding Road. She produced the album herself to quiet critics that had accused her of being a no-talent self promoter on her first album. This album was banned at Wal-Mart because Crow was critical of their policy of selling guns to minors in the track Love Is A Good Thing.\\n\\nIn 1997 Crow contributed the theme song to the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies. The song of the same title was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Song Written Specifically For a Motion Picture or Television.\\n\\nIn 1998 Crow released a third album, called The Globe Sessions. She discussed in press interviews having gone through a deep depression, and had a highly publicized relationship with music legend Eric Clapton. The debut single from this album, My Favorite Mistake, was rumored to be about him, though Crow claims otherwise. The album won Best Rock Album at the 1998 Grammy Awards; it was re-released in 1999, with a bonus track, Crow\\'s cover of the Guns N\\' Roses song Sweet Child O\\' Mine, which was included on the soundtrack of the film Big Daddy. This song won the 1999 Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. Other singles included \"There Goes the Neighborhood\", \"Anything But Down\" and \"The Difficult Kind\". \"There Goes the Neighborhood\" won a Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance in 2000 when it was included in her album, \"Sheryl Crow and Friends: Live from Central Park.\"\\n\\nIn 1999, Crow also made her acting debut as ill-fated drifter Laurie Bloom in the suspense/drama The Minus Man, which starred her then-boyfriend Owen Wilson as a serial killer.\\n\\nShe also released a live album called Sheryl Crow and Friends: Live From Central Park. The record found Crow singing many of her hit singles with new musical spins and guest appearances by many other musicians including Stevie Nicks, the Dixie Chicks, and Eric Clapton.\\n\\nIn 2002, after a break and some touring, Crow released C\\'mon, C\\'mon. Musically unlike any of her other records, the project had a more pop feel. Videos and promotional photos also found Crow more scantily clad than ever before, in bikinis and hot pants. Crow stated she was making a statement that women over 40 were still sexy. Whether a statement or a marketing tool, C\\'mon, C\\'mon spawned hits in \"Soak Up the Sun\" and 2002 Best Female Rock Performance Grammy winner \"Steve McQueen\". Crow also performed the song \"Safe & Sound\" from this album at a television benefit for the victims of September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks and at the MTV Video Music Awards. 2002 also found Crow collaborating with Stevie Nicks, and releasing a successful single called \"Picture\" with rumored boyfriend Kid Rock that peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Later Crow said they were good friends.\\n\\nCrow opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, wearing a shirt that read \"I don\\'t believe in your war, Mr. Bush!\" during a performance on Good Morning America and posting an open letter explaining her opposition on her website. Her public stance attracted so many supporters of the war to her website that the message board was closed for a number of days.\\n\\nIn 2003, Crow released a greatest hits compilation called The Very Best of Sheryl Crow. It featured many of her hit singles, as well as some new tracks. Among them was the ballad \"The First Cut is the Deepest\" (a song originally composed and performed by Cat Stevens), which became her biggest radio hit since her first, \"All I Wanna Do,\" which hit #2 in 1994. The single \"Light In Your Eyes\" was also released, but received limited airplay.\\n\\n2004 saw Crow appear as a musical theater performer in the Cole Porter biopic De-Lovely. Her performance within the film of the Porter classic \"Begin the Beguine\" was critically panned by film reviewers.\\n\\nCrow met cycling great Lance Armstrong at a cycling event in October of 2003. They began dating shortly thereafter and announced their engagement in September of 2005. Nearly five months later, however, they announced their surprise break-up in a joint statement issued on February 3, 2006: \"After much thought and consideration we have made a very tough decision to break up. We both have a deep love and respect for each other and we ask that everyone respect our privacy during this very difficult time.\" Previously, Crow denied a break-up, stating that \"when we were rumored to have split, and when our publicists called these magazines to say we haven\\'t split, the magazines were all so disappointed because that\\'s really what\\'s selling, rooting for a couple and then they split. That\\'s what sells the magazines.\"\\n\\nHer album Wildflower, which had a more slow paced feel than her previous albums, was released in September 2005. Although the album debuted at #2, it received mixed reviews and was not as commercially successful as hoped. In December 2005 the album was nominated for a Best Pop Vocal Album Grammy Award, while Sheryl Crow was nominated for a Best Female Pop Vocal Performance Grammy Award for the first single \"Good Is Good.\" The album got a new boost of life in 2006 when the second single was announced as \"Always on Your Side\", re-recorded with British musician Sting and sent off to radio, where it was quickly embraced at Adult Top 40.\\n\\nCrow was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer in late February 2006. Her doctors have stated that \"prognosis for a full recovery is excellent.\" [2]\\n\\nCrow\\'s first concert since her cancer diagnosis was on May 18 in Orlando, Florida where she played to over 10,000 Information Technology professionals at the SAP Sapphire Convention. Her first public appearance was on June 12, when she performed at the Murat Theater in Indianapolis, Indiana.\\n\\nCrow was a main stage act at Lilith Fair and has contributed many songs to movie soundtracks and special projects that were never made available elsewhere, among them: \"D\\'yer Maker\" (Encomium: Led Zeppelin Tribute), \"La Ci Darem la Mano\" from Don Giovanni (Pavarotti & Friends For War Child), and \"Resuscitation\" (The Faculty). In 2006, Crow contributed the opening track to the soundtrack for Disney/Pixar\\'s animated film Cars, \"Real Gone\".\\n\\nOfficial site:\\nwww.sherylcrow.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sheryl+Crow\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Born Eugene McDuffy in Champaign, Illinois, McDuff began playing bass, appearing in Joe Farrell\\'s group.\\n\\nEncouraged by Willis Jackson in whose band he also played bass in the late 50s, McDuff moved to the organ and began to attract the attention of Prestige Records while still with Jackson\\'s group. McDuff soon became a bandleader, leading groups featuring a young George Benson, Red Holloway on saxophone and Joe Dukes on drums.\\n\\nMcDuff recorded many classic albums on Prestige including his debut solo Brother Jack in 1960, The Honeydripper (1961), with tenor saxophonist Jimmy Forrest and guitarist Grant Green, and Brother Jack Meets The Boss (1962), featuring Gene Ammons, and Screamin’ (1962).\\n\\nAfter his tenure at Prestige, McDuff joined the Atlantic Records label for a brief period and then in the 70s recorded for Blue Note.

       " 'Bruce Channel (born as Bruce McMeans, on November 28, 1940, in Jacksonville, Texas) was a musician best known as a \\'one-hit-wonder\\' known for his 1962 number one song \"Hey! Baby\" (also known as \"Hey Baby\") while also being a songwriter for other artists.\\n\\nChannel originally performed on the Louisiana Hayride radio show, and then joined up with harmonica-player Delbert McClinton singing country music. Bruce wrote \"Hey! Baby\" in 1959, together with Margaret Cobb, and had been performing it for two years before recording it for Fort Worth record producer Bill Smith. It was originally released on Bill Smith\\'s label, but as it started to sell well, it was distributed by Smash. Besides topping the U.S. pop charts, it became No. 2 in the UK in 1962 as well.\\n\\nChannel toured Europe and was supported at one gig by The Beatles, who were then still unknown. John Lennon, who had \"Hey! Baby\" on his jukebox, was fascinated by McClinton\\'s harmonica and asked McClinton to teach him to play. The harmonica break in \"Hey! Baby\" not only inspired Lennon\\'s harmonica playing on The Beatles\\' 1962 first single \"Love Me Do\" and later records, but the harmonica break on Frank Ifield\\'s \"I Remember You\" in 1962.\\n\\nThe key to the appeal of \"Hey! Baby\" is the sustained first note, with a rhythmic shuffle in the background. This had previously occurred on a recent hit \"Sherry\" (1962) by The Four Seasons, and was later to recur on a Beatles song, \"I Should Have Known Better\" (on A Hard Day\\'s Night - 1964).\\n\\nDelbert McClinton went on to write songs that were recorded by Waylon Jennings and Emmylou Harris.\\n\\nBruce Channel\\'s only other Top 40 recording in the UK singles chart was 1968\\'s \"Keep On\".\\n\\n\"Hey! Baby\" was channelled (no pun intended) at the end of Bruce Springsteen\\'s biggest hit single, 1984\\'s \"Dancing in the Dark\".\\n\\n\"Hey! Baby\" appeared on the soundtrack to \"Dirty Dancing.\"\\n\\n\"Hey! Baby\" is a staple of several college pep bands, including the Penn State Blue Band, Marching Mizzou and the Georgetown University Pep Band. The bands generally play the song at home football and basketball games, while the student section sings along. They know the chorus well, but rarely the verses.\\n\\nA 2001 cover version by DJ Otzi reached both number 1 in the UK singles chart, as well as topping the equivalent listing in the USA. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Channel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Bruce Cockburn (pronounced \"CO-burn\") (born May 27, 1945 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) has had a long and distinguished career, with much success in his native Canada. He has written songs in styles ranging from folk to jazz-influenced rock to rock and roll. Cockburn was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 2001. In 2012 he received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal (in Canada the award was to honour \"significant contributions and achievements by Canadians\").\\n\\nCockburn\\'s early albums were fairly straight ahead folk music spotlighting his brilliant guitar playing. In fact, there were a good number of instrumental guitar numbers on those early recordings. A Christian element came into his music around the time of the album Salt, Sun and Time, and over time his writing has taken on a stronger and stronger political orientation.  \\n\\nPerhaps the most consistent element of Cockburn\\'s music has been his willingness to change and evolve over time. In this way, he is similar to fellow Canadians Joni Mitchell and Neil Young.\\n\\nHe has had a couple of radio hits in the United States, including (Wondering Where the Lions Are and If I Had a Rocket Launcher).\\n \\nHis albums in the 80s are considered some of his strongest, including Humans, Inner City Front, Stealing Fire, and Big Circumstance.  After Big Circumstance he struggled with writer\\'s block, and his output began to slow down; but he recovered with the formidable Nothing But a Burning Light, which led the way back to a sparer, more folk-oriented form of music.  His later album The Charity of Night contains one of his most thoughtful songs, Pacing the Cage.\\n\\nHis 2006 album Life Short Call Now was preceded by Speechless, a collection of instrumentals, many of them from earlier albums.  The album highlights Cockburn\\'s prodigious abilities as a guitarist. \\n\\nCockburn\\'s 31st studio album,Small Source of Comfort was released in March, 2011.  BruceCockburn.com called the album \"an adventurous collection of songs of romance, protest and spiritual discovery.

Springsteen is known for his poetic, socially conscious lyrics and energetic stage performances, sometimes lasting up to four hours.\\n\\nIn 1973, Springsteen released his first two albums, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. and The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle, neither of which earned him a large audience. He changed his style and reached worldwide popularity with Born to Run in 1975. It was followed by Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978) and The River (1980), which topped the US Billboard 200 chart. After the solo recording, Nebraska (1982), he reunited with the E Street Band for Born in the U.S.A. (1984), his most commercially successful album and one of the best-selling albums of all time. Seven of its singles reached the Top Ten of the Billboard Hot 100, including the title track. Springsteen recorded his next three albums, Tunnel of Love (1987), Human Touch (1992), and Lucky Town (1992) using mostly session musicians.

       " 'Bruce Randall Hornsby (born November 23, 1954 in Williamsburg, Virginia) is an American singer, virtuoso pianist, accordion player, and songwriter. He is probably best known for his 1980s signature song \"The Way It Is\" and the top five hits \"Mandolin Rain,\" and \"The Valley Road\", all recorded as Bruce Hornsby & The Range, and for his long association with the Grateful Dead. In some of his solo albums (from 1993) he moved in a less commercial, more musically-challenging direction. From 2000 he recorded albums a series of albums as Bruce Hornsby & The Noisemakers.\\n\\nIn 1984 Hornsby formed Bruce Hornsby & the Range, who were signed to RCA Records in 1985. Besides Hornsby, Range members were David Mansfield (guitar, mandolin, violin), George Marinelli (guitars and backing vocals), Joe Puerta (bass guitar and backing vocals), and John Molo (drums).\\n\\nDuring the 1990s he toured with the Grateful Dead, and released four albums, including A Night on the Town (1990) after which he split from The Range. Harbor Lights (1993) was his first solo album and signaled Hornsby was moving in a new jazz-influenced direction, whilst retaining elements of rock and pop. Later releases include Hot House (1995) and Spirit Trail (1998).\\n\\nHis experimental album Big Swing Face (2002) attracted much criticism as it veered away from his piano-based style. Despite these criticisms, he returned with his next studio album, shrugging off RCA and signing to Sony Music Entertainment. Halcyon Days, released in 2004, saw a return to the piano as the key instrument; this album also became the premise for his world tour the same year.\\n\\nHornsby continues to tour with his live band \"The Noisemakers\", in addition to  solo shows and his progressive bluegrass performances with Ricky Skaggs. \\n\\nIn 2007 he released Camp Meeting, his first total jazz album as The Bruce Hornsby Trio, which involved jazz giants, Jack DeJohnette and Christian McBride with whom he made live appearances with throughout 2007.\\n\\nIn March 2007 Hornsby teamed with bluegrass player Ricky Skaggs to produce a bluegrass album, Ricky Skaggs & Bruce Hornsby, and played several tour dates together. The seeds for the album had been sown in 2000 when the pair collaborated on \"Darlin\\' Cory\", a track on the Big Mon Bill Monroe bluegrass tribute album and then proposed recording an album together. Ricky Skaggs & Bruce Hornsby, featuring the duo backed by Skaggs\\'s band Kentucky Thunder, combined bluegrass, traditional country, \"a tinge of Hornsby\\'s jazzy piano and a splash of humor\" on a spectrum of songs from the traditional to new compositions such as the opening track \"The Dreaded Spoon,\" \"a humorous tale of a youthful ice cream heist. The pair also reinvented Hornsby\\'s hit \"Mandolin Rain\" as a minor key acoustic ballad and \"give his cautionary tale of backwoods violence\", \"A Night On the Town,\" a treatment highlighting the \"Appalachian storytelling tradition that was always at the song\\'s heart. The album ended with a surprise cover of Rick James\\'s funk hit \"Super Freak\" in a bluegrass arrangement. Ricky Skaggs & Bruce Hornsby topped Billboard\\'s bluegrass charts for several weeks. The album showed Hornsby carving out a place for piano within traditional bluegrass, disproving the notion that the piano is not compatible with \"string-oriented\" bluegrass.\\n\\nConcurrently with the bluegrass project, Hornsby recorded a jazz album, Camp Meeting. with Christian McBride (bass) and Jack DeJohnette (drums). Alongside original compositions by Hornsby, the trio delivered \"newly reharmonized versions\" of tunes by John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell, a previously unrecorded Ornette Coleman work (\"Questions and Answers\") and an early Keith Jarrett composition (\"Death and the Flower.\") The trio made a series of appearances in the summer of 2007, including the Playboy Jazz Festival, the Newport Jazz Festival and at the Hollywood Bowl.\\n\\nOn January 4, 2007, former Grateful Dead members Bob Weir, Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart reunited along with Hornsby, Mike Gordon (of Phish and the Rhythm Devils) and Warren Haynes to play two sets. including Dead classics, at a post-inauguration fundraising party for Nancy Pelosi, the first woman to serve as Speaker of the House in the United States Congress.\\n\\nHornsby wrote songs for a Broadway Musical, titled \"SCKBSTD\"; one song from this project, a playful biographical tune about real-estate tycoon Donald Trump titled \"The Don of Dons,\" made several appearances in setlists during his early-2007 solo piano performances. He also composed the score for Spike Lee\\'s ESPN documentary, Kobe Doin\\' Work, about NBA star Kobe Bryant and his MVP season.\\n\\nOutside of music composition and performance, Hornsby has taken an ownership interest in Williamsburg area radio station \"The Tide,\" WTYD 92.3 FM, and he has endowed the Bruce Hornsby Creative American Music Program at University of Miami\\'s Frost School of Music, encouraging the study of songwriting broadly across traditional genres. Hornsby played himself in a cameo role in the Robin Williams movie World\\'s Greatest Dad, in which Williams\\' character is a Bruce Hornsby fan.\\n\\nHe has also been honored by piano makers Steinway & Sons with their Limited Edition Signature Piano Series. Hornsby selected ten Model B Steinway Grands to be featured in this collection, each one personalized with his signature.

       " 'Bryan Ferry CBE (born 26 September 1945) is an English singer and songwriter. His voice has been described as an \"elegant, seductive croon\". He also established a distinctive image and sartorial style: according to The Independent, Ferry and his contemporary David Bowie influenced a generation with both their music and their appearances. Peter York described Ferry as \"an art object\" who \"should hang in the Tate\".\\n\\nBorn to a working-class family, Ferry studied fine art and taught at a secondary school before pursuing a career in music. In 1970 he began to assemble the rock band Roxy Music with a group of friends and acquaintances in London, and took the role of lead singer and main songwriter. The band achieved immediate international success with the release of their eponymous debut album in 1972, containing a rich multitude of sounds, which reflected Ferry\\'s interest in exploring different genres of music. Their second album, For Your Pleasure (1973), further cultivated the band\\'s unique sound and visual image that would establish Ferry as a leading cultural icon over the next decade.\\n\\nFerry began a parallel solo career in 1973 by releasing These Foolish Things, which popularized for the first time the concept of a contemporary musician releasing an album covering standard songs and was a drastic departure from his ongoing work with Roxy Music. His second album, Another Time, Another Place (1974), featured as its cover image Ferry posing by a pool in a white dinner jacket and represented one of his most impactful fashion statements. Over the next two years, Roxy Music released a trilogy of albums, Stranded (1973), Country Life (1974) and Siren (1975), which broadened the band\\'s appeal internationally and saw Ferry take greater interest in the role of a live performer, reinventing himself in stage costumes ranging from gaucho to military uniforms.\\n\\nFerry disbanded Roxy Music following the release of their best-selling album Avalon in 1982 to concentrate on his solo career, releasing further singles such as \"Slave to Love\" and \"Don\\'t Stop the Dance\" and the UK no. 1 album Boys and Girls in 1985. Including his work with Roxy Music, Ferry has sold over 30 million albums worldwide.\\n\\nAs well as being a prolific songwriter, Ferry has recorded many cover versions, including standards from the Great American Songbook, in albums such as These Foolish Things (1973), Another Time, Another Place (1974), Let\\'s Stick Together (1976), Taxi (1993) and As Time Goes By (1999), as well as Dylanesque (2007), an album of Bob Dylan covers.

       " 'Alvis Edgar Owens Jr. (August 12, 1929 – March 25, 2006), known professionally as Buck Owens, was an American musician, singer, songwriter, and band leader. He was the lead singer for Buck Owens and the Buckaroos, which had 21 No. 1 hits on the Billboard country music chart. He pioneered what came to be called the Bakersfield sound, named in honor of Bakersfield, California, Owens\\'s adopted home and the city from which he drew inspiration for what he preferred to call \"American music\".\\n\\nWhile the Buckaroos originally featured a fiddle and retained pedal steel guitar into the 1970s, their sound on records and onstage was always more stripped-down and elemental. The band\\'s signature style was based on simple story lines, infectious choruses, a twangy electric guitar, an insistent rhythm supplied by a prominent drum track, and high, two-part vocal harmonies featuring Owens and his guitarist Don Rich.\\n\\nFrom 1969 to 1986, Owens co-hosted the popular CBS television variety show Hee Haw with Roy Clark (syndicated beginning in 1971). According to his son Buddy Alan (Owens), the accidental 1974 death of Rich, his best friend, devastated him for years and impacted his creative efforts until he performed with Dwight Yoakam in 1988.\\n\\nOwens is a member of both the Country Music Hall of Fame and Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.\\n\\nOwens was born on a farm in Sherman, Texas, United States, to Alvis Edgar Owens Sr. and Maicie Azel (née Ellington) Owens.\\n\\nIn the biography About Buck., Rich Kienzle writes: \"\\'Buck\\' was a donkey on the Owens farm.\" \"When Alvis Jr. was three or four years old, he walked into the house and announced that his name also was \"Buck.\" That was fine with the family, and the boy\\'s name became \"Buck\" from then on.\"He attended public school for grades 1–3 in Garland, Texas.\\n\\nOwens\\' family moved to Mesa, Arizona, in 1937 during the Dust Bowl and Great Depression. While attending school in Arizona, Owens found that while he disliked formal schoolwork, he could often satisfy class requirements by singing or performing in school plays. A self-taught musician and singer, Owens became proficient on guitar, mandolin, horns, and drums. When he obtained his first electric steel guitar, he taught himself to play it after his father adapted an old radio into an amplifier. Owens quit school in the ninth grade in order to help work on his father\\'s farm and pursue a music career.\\n\\nOwens had three sons: Buddy Alan (who charted several hits as a Capitol recording artist in the early 1970s and appeared with his father numerous times on Hee Haw), Johnny, and Michael Owens.\\n\\nOwens successfully recovered from oral cancer in the early 1990s, but had additional health problems near the end of the 1990s and the early 2000s, including pneumonia and a minor stroke in 2004. These health problems had forced him to curtail his regular weekly performances with the Buckaroos at his Crystal Palace. Owens died in his sleep of an apparent heart attack at his ranch just north of Bakersfield on March 25, 2006, only hours after performing at his club. He was 76 years old.\\n\\nOwens was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1996. He was ranked No. 12 in CMT\\'s 40 Greatest Men of Country Music in 2003. In addition, CMT also ranked the Buckaroos No. 2 in the network\\'s 20 Greatest Bands in 2005. He was also inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.\\n\\nThe stretch of US Highway 82 in Sherman, Texas, is named the Buck Owens Freeway in his honor. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Buck+Owens\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Bucky Covington\\'s road to Nashville came down to convincing one person. He had impressed millions with his talent and charisma on \"American Idol,\" making it to the final eight, but it was something else that sold him to Sawyer Brown frontman and producer Mark Miller.\\n    \\n\"There was a quality in his voice that was honest,\" says Miller. \"I believed him when he sang.\"\\n   \\n Miller approached Covington, and their collaboration has led the North Carolina singer to a deal on Lyric Street Records and a debut single, \"A Different World,\" that is taking the Idol favorite to the country charts and airwaves.\\n    \\nIt\\'s a chain of events that almost didn\\'t happen. Covington was a popular local club singer with a day job in his father\\'s auto body shop when he toyed with the idea of a 12-hour drive to an Idol tryout in Memphis. Hurricane Katrina canceled the event and Covington let it slide. Then his sister-in-law told him of a newly scheduled tryout in nearby Greensboro.\\n  \\n“I thought, \\'Now I have to do it,\\'\" he says, \"That\\'s just karma.\"\\n    \\nStardom was nothing more than an idle dream when Covington picked up the guitar at age 19. He played in southern rock bands and then in the highly popular country/Southern rock band Southern Thunder, becoming one of the area\\'s top draws. His increasing popularity and the continual urging of friends finally convinced him to take his shot at the big time.\\n    \\nHe and his identical twin Rocky were born in Rockingham, NC, and raised in Laurinburg after his parents\\' divorce and mother\\'s remarriage. Drawn early to country music, Covington was a fan of Tim McGraw, George Strait and Travis Tritt, among others. He enjoyed motocross and music as a teenager, and juggled weekend gigs with his work in the body shop after graduating from high school.\\n    \\nThroughout his career, the believability that led Mark Miller to want to produce him has been bound up in Covington\\'s very approach to music.\\n   \\n\"Any song that I pick, I have to feel,\" he says, \"because if I can feel it, I can make you feel it.\"\\n    \\nThat was very much in evidence on the 39-city American Idol tour and then on GAC\\'s Country Music Christmas tour, where he showed himself to be a compelling and versatile performer, winning fans in city after city. Now, with the release of his debut single and album, the rest of America will get to witness Bucky Covington\\'s emergence as one of country\\'s most outstanding young performers.\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bucky+Covington\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Charles Hardin Holley (September 7, 1936 – February 3, 1959), known as Buddy Holly, was an American singer, musician, songwriter, and record producer who was a central and pioneering figure of mid-1950s rock. \\n\\nHe was born in Lubbock, Texas, to a musical family during the Great Depression, and learned to play guitar and sing alongside his siblings. His style was influenced by gospel music, country music, and rhythm and blues acts, and he performed in Lubbock with his friends from high school. He made his first appearance on local television in 1952, and the following year he formed the group \"Buddy and Bob\" with his friend Bob Montgomery. In 1955, after opening for Elvis Presley, he decided to pursue a career in music. He opened for Presley three times that year; his band\\'s style shifted from country and western to entirely rock and roll. In October that year, when he opened for Bill Haley & His Comets, he was spotted by Nashville scout Eddie Crandall, who helped him get a contract with Decca Records.\\n\\nHolly\\'s recording sessions at Decca were produced by Owen Bradley. Unhappy with Bradley\\'s control in the studio and with the sound he achieved there, he went to producer Norman Petty in Clovis, New Mexico, and recorded a demo of \"That\\'ll Be the Day\", among other songs. Petty became the band\\'s manager and sent the demo to Brunswick Records, which released it as a single credited to \"The Crickets\", which became the name of Holly\\'s band. In September 1957, as the band toured, \"That\\'ll Be the Day\" topped the US \"Best Sellers in Stores\" chart and the UK Singles Chart. Its success was followed in October by another major hit, \"Peggy Sue\".\\n\\nThe album Chirping Crickets, released in November 1957, reached number five on the UK Albums Chart. Holly made his second appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in January 1958 and soon after, toured Australia and then the UK. In early 1959, he assembled a new band, consisting of future country music star Waylon Jennings (bass), famed session musician Tommy Allsup (guitar), and Carl Bunch (drums), and embarked on a tour of the midwestern U.S. After a show in Clear Lake, Iowa, he chartered an airplane to travel to his next show, in Moorhead, Minnesota. Soon after takeoff, the plane crashed, killing him, Ritchie Valens, The Big Bopper, and pilot Roger Peterson in a tragedy later referred to by Don McLean as \"The Day the Music Died\".\\n\\nDuring his short career, Holly wrote, recorded, and produced his own material. He is often regarded as the artist who defined the traditional rock-and-roll lineup of two guitars, bass, and drums. He was a major influence on later popular music artists, including Bob Dylan, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, Weezer, and Elton John. He was among the first artists inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in 1986.

Most widely known as the drummer for Jimi Hendrix\\'s ill-fated Band of Gypsys, Miles is also the vocalist for The California Raisins commercials.\\n\\nBeginning his career at twelve when he joined his father\\'s jazz band The Bebops, as a teenager Miles played in a variety of bands including Ruby & the Romantics, the Ink Spots and the Delfonics.\\n\\nIn 1967 he formed Electric Flag with guitarist Mike Bloomfield. While the lead vocalist for the Flag was Nick Gravenites, fans of the Flag always looked forward to the numbers sung by Miles. Listen to the slow blues song \"Texas\" by the short-lived Flag and you will get a sense of what Miles brought to the group. The group broke up after their 2nd album, and Miles formed the Buddy Miles Express. He played with Jimi Hendrix on the Electric Ladyland album, and later formed Band of Gypsys with Hendrix. Band of Gypsys made a famous and enduring live album that was recorded in New York\\'s Fillmore East on New Year\\'s Eve 1969/70. However during a follow up performance a month later, Hendrix had a minor, drug-related meltdown on stage and Miles was fired by Hendrix manager, Michael Jeffrey.\\n\\nIt should not go unmentioned that part of Miles\\' appeal as a rock musician was his physical appearance. He drew many stares and smiles as he held court from the drumset in the Electric Flag days, with his American flag or sequined shirts, his high-brushed Afro, and his massive frame and smile. Buddy was an eyeful for the hippies and concertgoers of the day.\\n\\nIn 1986 Miles performed vocals for the California Raisins claymation ad campaign, most notably singing I Heard It Through the Grapevine.

In 1943, he was recruited as a saxophonist by bandleader Lucky Millinder, and the musicians in Millinder\\'s band gave him the nickname \"Bull Moose\" for his appearance. He began singing when required to stand in for Wynonie Harris at a show in Texas.\\n\\nMillinder encouraged Jackson to sign a solo contract with Syd Nathan of King Records to play rhythm and blues. He first recorded in his own right in 1946, with \"I Know Who Threw the Whiskey\", an answer song to Millinder\\'s \"Who Threw the Whiskey in the Well\". The following year, his recording of \"I Love You, Yes I Do\" reputedly became the first R&B single to sell a million copies, holding the #1 spot on the R&B chart for three weeks and crossing over to the pop chart, where it made #24.\\n\\nHe formed his own group, The Buffalo Bearcats, and over the next five years recorded in a wide variety of musical styles, including both romantic crooning and bawdy jump blues. Other big hits in 1948 included the double-sided hit \"All My Love Belongs to You\" / \"I Want a Bowlegged Woman\", and his biggest R&B chart hit, \"I Can\\'t Go On Without You\", which stayed at # 1 on the R&B chart for eight weeks.

       " 'Rapper Bun B (born Bernard Freeman) rose to fame in the duo UGK. Bun B and Pimp C formed UGK in the late \\'80s when their former crew, Four Black Ministers, fell apart. Based in Port Arthur, Texas, UGK signed with Jive and with 1992\\'s \\'Too Hard to Swallow\\' began a series of Southern gangsta rap albums that were successful sellers. Bun B formed the side project Mddl Fngz in 2000, but his main concern was still UGK. Things came to halt in 2003 when Pimp C was sentenced to eight years in prison on an aggravated gun assault charge. Bun B carried on solo, making numerous appearances on other artists\\' tracks and then in 2005 releasing both the mixtape Legends and his debut album, Trill, a Top Ten hit. With Pimp C seeing early release in late 2005, Bun B returned to UGK and a self-titled double album from the duo dropped in 2007. Tragedy struck in late 2007 when Pimp C died suddenly, leaving Bun B to return to a solo career. His second solo album, II Trill, arrived in May of the next year.

He left boxing to pursue a career singing gospel, and in the late 1950s joined the Mighty Clouds of Joy.\\n\\nIn 1962 he was offered the chance to record a secular novelty song by manager Ray Vernon, the brother of Link Wray. Adopting the pseudonym Bunker Hill so as not to lose his position with the Mighty Clouds of Joy, he recorded several tracks with a band including Link Wray on guitar. One of the tracks, \"Hide and Go Seek\", became a hit single in the United States, reaching #27 on the Billboard R&B charts and #33 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was featured in the 1988 movie Hairspray. Despite hiding his identity, he was still found out and asked to leave the Mighty Clouds of Joy as a result.\\n\\nHis later life is obscure, although it is believed that he did perform occasionally as a member of the Mighty Clouds of Joy before leaving the music industry in the late 1960s.

       " 'Four Tet is the name used by Kieran Hebden (born 1977 in Putney, London, UK) for his experimental  electronic music-oriented solo efforts, to differentiate from his work with post-rock band Fridge.\\n\\nHebden\\'s solo work typically utilises samples lifted from various sources including hip-hop, electronica, techno, jazz, and folk mixed with his own guitar playing. Four Tet shares some stylistic similarities with other musicians, such as Prefuse 73, who use computer editing techniques that give the music a staccato, cut-up feel. Hebden\\'s music is notable for its rich, organic sounds and harmonious melodies as well as for eschewing the traditional pop-song format in favour of a more abstract approach.\\n\\nKieran Hebden began releasing material as Four Tet in 1998 with the 36 minute and 25 second single \"Thirtysixtwentyfive\" on Trevor Jackson\\'s Output Recordings label. Later that year, he released a second single, the jazz-influenced \"Misnomer\". 1999\\'s \"Dialogue\", again on Output, was Four Tet\\'s first full-length album release and fused hip-hop drum lines with dissonant jazz samples. This was followed by the double A-side single \"Glasshead\"/\"Calamine\", which was to be Four Tet\\'s last release on Output.\\n\\nIn late 1999, Warp Records released a tenth-anniversary compilation of remixes of Warp tracks; Hebden contributed a remix of \"Cliffs\", the opening track of Aphex Twin\\'s \"Selected Ambient Works, Vol. II\". This relatively high profile exposure attracted a lot of new interest in Four Tet from fans of electronica and IDM, genres in which the Warp brand had a preeminent status.\\n\\nIn 2001, Four Tet\\'s second album \"Pause\" was released on Domino and found Hebden using more folk and electronic samples, which was quickly dubbed \"folktronica\" by the media & press in an attempt to label the style (often also applied to artists such as Isan, Gravenhurst and some of Canabrism\\'s later work). The acoustic guitar track \"Everything Is Alright\" is the theme music for the National Public Radio talk show On Point, produced at WBUR in Boston, Massachusetts; it was also featured in a US Nike commercial in 2001-2002 and in the Sony Bravia commercial in 2005.\\n\\n\"Rounds\" was released in May 2003. It was Hebden\\'s most ambitious album to date, incorporating diverse samples such as the mandolin on \"Spirit Fingers\", and even a rubber duck on the closing track \"Slow Jam\". Three singles were released from the album: \"She Moves She\", \"As Serious as Your Life\", and \"My Angel Rocks Back and Forth\". This last single was released as an EP featuring remixes by electronica duo Icarus and Isambard Khroustaliov along with additional Four Tet tracks \"I\\'ve Got Viking in Me\" and \"All the Chimers\". An accompanying DVD featured all of Four Tet\\'s videos to date.\\n\\nAt the beginning of 2003, Four Tet opened for Radiohead on their European tour. A remix of the song Scatterbrain from Radiohead\\'s latest album \"Hail to the Thief\" was included on their 2004 EP \"COM LAG (2plus2isfive)\".\\n\\nA live album named \"Live in Copenhagen 30th March 2004\" was released in April 2004 as a limited edition, available only through the Domino Records website.\\n\\nIn March and April of 2005, Four Tet performed two shows of improvisational music, in collaboration with jazz drummer Steve Reid, in Paris and London. He also appears on Steve Reid Ensemble 2005 album \"Spirit Walk\". This collaboration was extended into a series of international tours, and the release of two albums, \"The Exchange Session Vol. 1\" and \"The Exchange Session Vol. 2\" over the course of 2005 and 2006.\\n\\nHis fourth studio album \"Everything Ecstatic\" was released on Domino on 23 May 2005. The video for the lead single, \"Smile Around The Face\", features actor Mark Heap. The album brought with it another shift in style, leaving behind the breezy \"folktronica\" of \"Pause\" and \"Rounds\" for a darker, more complex sound. On 7 November 2005, Domino has released a DVD version of \"Everything Ecstatic\" featuring video clips for each track of the album plus a CD with new material.\\n\\nHebden has also remixed, under the Four Tet name, tracks by a wide range of artists including Madvillain, Bloc Party, Super Furry Animals, Beth Orton, Badly Drawn Boy, The Notwist, Boom Bip, Kings of Convenience, Explosions in the Sky, Radiohead, and Doves. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Four+Tet\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Burt Freeman Bacharach(May 12, 1928 – February 8, 2023) was an American composer, songwriter, and musician who is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential figures of 20th-century popular music.\\n\\nBacharach studied music at McGill University and the Mannes School of Music. In the 1950s and the early 1960s he was the pianist, arranger and bandleader for Marlene Dietrich with whom he toured. He teamed with lyricist Hal David and others to write many popular songs in the 1960s and 1970s.\\n\\nBacharach\\'s music has been sung by a number of popular singers including The Beatles,The Carpenters, Aretha Franklin, Jack Jones, Tom Jones, Dusty Springfield, Luther Vandross and The Drifters. He met Dionne Warwick, with whom he would form a famed collaboration. His songs are characterized by (1) the use of unexpected harmonic changes and (2) unusual rhythmic patterns and time signatures. He employs times such as 5/4 or 3/2, and frequently goes from one time signature to another in the same song, often after each measure. He also changes keys frequently. An excellent example of his style is \"Promises, Promises\", from his score to the musical of the same name. He has a total of 52 Top 40 hits. In addition, many of his songs were adapted by jazz artists of the time, such as Stan Getz and Wes Montgomery. The Bacharach-David composition \"My Little Red Book\", originally recorded by Manfred Mann for the film What\\'s New, Pussycat, and promptly covered by Love in 1965, has become a rock standard. He composed and arranged the soundtrack of the 1967 film Casino Royale.\\n\\nHe has been married four times, to Paula Stewart (1953-1958), to actress Angie Dickinson (1965-1980), to lyricist Carole Bayer Sager (1982-1991) - with whom he collaborated on a number of pieces - and (since 1993) Jane Hanson. He has a total of four children, two girls and two boys.\\n\\nIn 1998 he collaborated on an album called Painted From Memory with singer/songwriter Elvis Costello. His 2005 album At This Time features collaborations with Costello, Rufus Wainwright, and Dr. Dre (who provides bass-and-drum loops).\\n\\nBacharach has had cameo roles in a number of Hollywood movies including all three Austin Powers movies. His music is also credited as providing inspiration for these movies.\\n\\nDuring subsequent Burt Bacharach concert tours, each show would open with a very brief video clip from the movie Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, with Mike Myers (as Austin Powers) uttering \"Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Burt Bacharach\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Burt+Bacharach\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Album releases include: \"The New King of the Blues\".\\n\\nIn the 1930s and 1940s he played harmonica at local clubs and made a few non-commercial recordings. These included \"I\\'m Gonna Make You Happy\" (1943), which was recorded when he played at the folk festival at Fort Valley (GA) State Teachers College and was recorded by the Library of Congress\\' Folk Music Archive.

He signed to Bow Records at age 15, releasing a few singles but finding no success. After signing with Columbia Records, he released the single \"Hello Mr. Moonlight\", which did not chart. The follow-up, \"Baby Sittin\\' Boogie\"/\"Driftwood\" (though \"Driftwood\" was technically the B-side the record tends to be regarded as a double-A-side), became a crossover hit in the U.S. in 1961, peaking at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100, #27 R&B, and #28 Country. The record went on to sell over one million copies, and as a result of its success, Columbia tried to groom Clifford as a heartthrob pop singer. He appeared on TV with Perry Como and Merv Griffin and on American Bandstand, and toured the United Kingdom with Freddy Cannon and Dion. Clifford\\'s fame was short-lived, however; further singles went nowhere (a remake of Kay Kyser\\'s \"Three Little Fishies\" hit #102) and Clifford soon found himself without a recording contract.\\n\\nAfter serving in the National Guard, Clifford moved to Los Angeles, California, and found work as a songwriter, writing tunes sung by Keith Barbour, Petula Clark, Clyde McPhatter, Lou Rawls, Leon Russell, Freddie King, and Kris Kristofferson.

The songs are digitally remastered, and some striking differences are apparent, including a fade-out ending on \"Driftwood\".\\n\\nIn 2009, the rap duo Method Man & Redman released the track \"Four Minutes to Lock Down\" (feat.

       " 'Bénabar (Bruno Nicolini, born June 16, 1969) is a French songwriter and singer, who could be compared to Vincent Delerm and other singers from his generation. As many of them he was influenced by Georges Brassens, Renaud Séchan, Jacques Higelin and also Tom Waits. His songs describe day-to-day life events with humour and a tender cynicism. His songs draw influence from French Chanson and a heavy influence is placed on the piano or the accordion and on typical French fanfare (brass band) for the most upbeat of them. This genre of music is very typically French and differs from most in that emphasis is placed on appreciation of the lyrics and that it is linked to a specific culture of modern “guinche” (slang for “guinguette”) appreciated a lot by Bobos among others.\\n\\nHe began his career in the cinema, working as an assistant on Le Brasier (1991) and directed three short subjects Nada Lezard (1991), Sursum corda (1994) et José Jeannette (1992). He then turned to music, working for some time with his friend Patchol who gave him his nickname (Bénabar being the “verlan” of Barnabé, the name he was using on stage). With “Les associés” he sang for several years in small places in France, Belgium, Switzerland before becoming more and more popular after the release of Bénabar (2001) that enabled him to be the opening act for Henri Salvador. He was nominated as a Revelation for the “Victoires de la musique 2003” but did not win it. In 2004, after the successful release of Les risques du métier, he won the award for “album “chanson/variété” of the year”. His next album Reprise des négociations sold better than the previous ones: according to Le Figaro, Bénabar reached number 4 for CD sales in France, with 2.18 million euros sales in 2006. In 2007 he won the awards for “Male group or artist of the year” and “original song of the year” (for Le dîner). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/B%C3%A9nabar\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'William Dale Fries Jr. (November 15, 1928 – April 1, 2022), best known by his stage name C. W. McCall, was an American singer who wrote truck-themed outlaw country songs. Prior to his musical career, he worked in advertising, and won several Clio Awards. His most successful song was \"Convoy\", a surprise pop-crossover hit in 1975, reaching number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. He was elected mayor of Ouray, Colorado, and served in that position from 1986 to 1992.\\n\\nMcCall was born Billie Dale Fries on November 15, 1928, in Audubon, Iowa. His father was also called Billie and so he was the junior. He later legally changed his name to William Dale Fries, Jr.\\n\\nMcCall is best known for the 1976 No. 1 hit song, \"Convoy\". Its theme of using CB radio to rebel against the new federal speed limit of 55 mph was popular and topical so the single sold over two million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA in December 1975. Though McCall is not a one-hit wonder, \"Convoy\" went on to become his signature song. McCall first charted the song \"Wolf Creek Pass\", which reached No. 40 on the U.S. pop top 40 in 1975. Two other songs reached the Billboard Hot 100, \"Old Home Filler-Up an\\' Keep on a-Truckin\\' Cafe\", as well as the environmentally-oriented \"There Won\\'t Be No Country Music (There Won\\'t Be No Rock \\'n\\' Roll)\". \"Classified\" and \"\\'Round the World with the Rubber Duck\" (a pirate-flavored sequel to \"Convoy\") bubbled under the Hot 100. A dozen McCall songs appeared on Billboard\\'s Hot Country Singles chart, including the sentimental \"Roses for Mama\" (1977).\\n\\nIn 1978, the movie Convoy was released, based on the C. W. McCall song. The film starred Kris Kristofferson, Ali MacGraw, Burt Young, and Ernest Borgnine and was directed by Sam Peckinpah. It featured a new version of the song, written specially for the film.\\n\\nThe song \"Convoy\" is featured in Grand Theft Auto V. In 2014, Rolling Stone ranked \"Convoy\" No. 98 on their list of 100 Greatest Country Songs.\\n\\nIn addition to the \"original six\" McCall albums released between 1975 and 1979, two rare singles exist. \"Kidnap America\" was a politically/socially-conscious track released in 1980 during the Iran hostage crisis, while \"Pine Tar Wars\" referred to an event that actually happened in a New York Yankees–Kansas City Royals baseball game during 1983 (a dispute concerning the application of a large quantity of pine tar to a baseball bat used by George Brett, one of the Royals\\' players).\\n\\nFries died on April 1, 2022, at age 93 from complications of cancer. In an interview he conducted on February 9 while in palliative hospice care, he gave his blessing for the use of his signature song \"Convoy\" for the Freedom Convoy protests in Canada, with Taste of Country noting that he was \"energized and enthusiastic\" about the revival of interest in the song and its message. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/C.W.+McCall\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Christian Jay Bolland\\nProfile:\\nBorn in Yorkshire in 1971 but transplanted to Belgium when he was only three, CJ Bolland received an early education in dance music; his parents ran a club in Antwerp, and his mother DJed there. He grew up listening to the synthesizer music of several eras — from Jean-Michel Jarre to Front 242 and the Neon Judgement — but began devoting most of his time to house and techno by the late \\'80s. Bolland began producing in 1988, when a drummer friend gave him access to the right gear, and his tracks were soon heard on several Belgian pirate radio stations. He then sent demos to several labels, and finally heard back from R & S Records.\\nCJ Bolland\\'s first production for R & S, the Project\\'s \"Do That Dance\", jump-started his career, and he soon saw releases from his projects Pulse, Space Opera (with the Advent\\'s Cisco Ferreira), Cee-Jay, Ravesignal and Sonic Solution. His 1992 \"Ravesignal 3 EP\" (specifically, the track \"Horsepower\") made Bolland one of the hottest names in the new global dance community.\\n\\nBolland made his album debut soon after, with \"The 4th Sign\". His 1993-94 schedule also included production work for Mundo Muzique, Dave Angel and Joey Beltram as well as remixing for Orbital, The Prodigy, Sven Väth, WestBam, Tori Amos and Baby Ford, among others. His second album \"Electronic Highway\" was released in 1995, after which Bolland signed a mammoth five-album deal with Internal Records. The first fruits of the contract, \"The Analogue Theatre\", were released in late 1996 to critical praise and dance-chart success, thanks to the excitable single \"Sugar Is Sweeter\".\\n\\nHe founded his own label \"Mole Records\" in 2002.\\nSites:\\ncjbolland.com\\n\\nAlbums\\nThe 4th Sign R & S Records, R & S Records 1992 \\t\\t\\nElectronic Highway R & S Records \\t1995 \\t\\t\\nThe Analogue Theatre Internal, Internal \\t1996 \\t\\t\\nThe 5th Sign \\u200e(12xFile, AAC) Wack Attack Barrack 2006 \\t\\t\\n500€ Cocktail \\u200e(CD) Wikkid Records 2009 \\t\\t\\n500€ Cocktail \\u200e(12xFile, WAV, Album) Wikkid Records \\t2009 \\t\\t\\n\\nSingles & EPs\\nThe Ravesignal 6 versions R & S Records 1990 \\t\\t\\nRavesignal Vol. II  R & S Records 1990 \\t\\t\\nRavesignal III 6 versions R & S Records 1991 \\t\\t\\nProject, The (3) / Ceejay* - Get Busy Time / Here We Go \\u200e(12\", Promo, Ltd) \\tR & S Records 1991 \\t\\t\\nLive At Universe 30-04-93 R & S Records \\t1993 \\t\\t\\nCamargue (The Remixes) R & S Records 1993 \\t\\t\\nNeural Paradox R & S Records 1995 \\t\\t\\nThe Starship Universe E.P.

Trainor rose to prominence with her 2014 debut single \"All About That Bass\", which topped the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 for eight consecutive weeks and topped the charts in other countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom.\\n\\nAt age 17, Trainor won the worldwide Sonicbids 2011 Tennessee Concerts Song Contest with her song \"You\\'re Good With Me.\" She also attended the Durango Songwriter\\'s Expo and Big Al Anderson of NRBQ introduced her to Carla Wallace of Big Yellow Dog Music. Trainor signed as a songwriter with Big Yellow Dog Music shortly after her 18th birthday, while she was still in high school.

He dropped his debut mixtape It\\'s My Time on October 31, 2011 on Bases Loaded Records and generated a buzz with the infectious club track, Cashin Out .

       " 'Cabell \"Cab\" Calloway III (December 25, 1907 – November 18, 1994) was a jazz singer, bandleader, composer and actor. He was strongly associated with the Cotton Club in Harlem, New York City, where he was a regular performer.\\nCalloway was a master of energetic scat singing and led one of the United States\\' most popular big bands, Cab Calloway and his Orchestra, from the start of the 1930s through to the late 1940s. Calloway\\'s band featured performers including trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Doc Cheatham, saxophonists Ben Webster and Chu Berry, New Orleans guitar ace Danny Barker and bassist Milt Hinton. Calloway continued to perform until his death in 1994 at the age of 86.\\n\\nCalloway was born to a middle-class family in Rochester, New York, and lived there until 1918. He later lived in Baltimore, Maryland. His father, Cabell Calloway II, was a lawyer, and his mother, Martha Eulalia Reed, was a teacher and church organist. His parents recognised their son\\'s musical talent, and he began private voice lessons in 1922. He continued to study music and voice throughout his formal schooling. Despite his parents\\' and vocal teachers\\' disapproval of jazz, Calloway began frequenting and eventually performing in many of Baltimore\\'s jazz clubs, where he was mentored by drummer Chick Webb and pianist Johnny Jones.\\n\\nAfter graduating from high school, Calloway joined his older sister, Blanche, in a touring production of the popular black musical revue Plantation Days (Blanche Calloway herself went on to become an accomplished bandleader before her brother did, and he often credited his inspiration to enter show business to her). Calloway attended Lincoln University, Pennsylvania , and left in 1930 without graduating.\\n\\nWhen the tour ended in Chicago in the autumn, Cab decided to remain in Chicago with his sister, who had an established career as a jazz singer in that city. His parents had hopes of their son becoming a lawyer like his father, so Calloway enrolled in Crane College. His main interest, however, was in singing and entertaining, and he spent most of his nights at the Dreamland Cafe, the Sunset Cafe, and the Club Berlin, performing as a drummer, singer, and emcee. At the Sunset Cafe he met and performed with Louis Armstrong who taught him to sing in the scat style.\\n\\nThe Cotton Club was the premier jazz venue in the country, and Cab Calloway and his Orchestra (he had taken over a brilliant but failing band called \"The Missourians\" in 1930) were hired as a replacement for the Duke Ellington Orchestra while they were touring. Calloway quickly proved so popular that his band became the co-house band with Ellington\\'s, and he and his group began touring nationwide when not playing at the Cotton Club. Their popularity was greatly enhanced by the twice-weekly live national radio broadcasts on NBC at the Cotton Club. Calloway also appeared on Walter Winchell\\'s radio program and with Bing Crosby in his show at the Paramount Theatre. As a result of these appearances, Calloway, together with Ellington, broke the major broadcast network colour barrier.\\n\\nUnlike many other bands of comparable commercial success, Calloway\\'s gave ample soloing space to its lead members, and, through the varied arrangements of Walter \\'Foots\\' Thomas, provided much more in the way of musical interest.\\n\\nIn 1931, he recorded his most famous song, \"Minnie the Moocher\". That song, together with \"St James Infirmary Blues\" and \"The Old Man of the Mountain\", were performed for the Betty Boop animated shorts Minnie the Moocher, Snow White, and The Old Man of the Mountain respectively. Through rotoscoping, Cab not only gave his voice to these cartoons but his dance steps as well. Cab took advantage of this and timed his concerts in some communities with the release of the films in order to make the most of the attention. As a result of the success of \"Minnie the Moocher\" he became identified with its chorus, gaining the nickname \"The Hi De Ho Man\". He also performed in a series of short films for Paramount in the 1930s (Calloway and Ellington were featured on film more than any other Jazz Orchestra of the era). In 1943 he appeared in the high-profile 20th Century Fox musical film, Stormy Weather.\\n\\nIn his later career, Calloway became a popular personality, appearing in a number of films and stage productions that utilised both his acting and singing talents. In 1952, he played the prominent role of Sportin\\' Life in a production of the Gershwin opera Porgy and Bess. Another notable role was Yeller in The Cincinnati Kid (1965). In 1967 Calloway co-starred as Horace Vandergelder in an all-black revival of Hello, Dolly! (even though the original production was still running) starring Pearl Bailey. This was a major success, and led to a cast recording released by RCA. In 1973-1974 he was featured in an unsuccessful Broadway revival of The Pajama Game.\\n\\nCalloway attracted renewed interest in 1980 when he appeared as a supporting character in the film The Blues Brothers, performing \"Minnie the Moocher\", and again when he sang \"The Jumpin\\' Jive\" with the Two-Headed Monster on Sesame Street. This was also the year in which the cult film Forbidden Zone was released, which included rearrangements and parodies of Cab Calloway songs written by Danny Elfman, a Calloway fan.\\n\\nOn 18th November 1994 Calloway died, having suffered a major stroke six months earlier.

       " 'Cal Smith (born April 7, 1932) is an American country musician, most famous for his 1974 hit \"Country Bumpkin.\"\\n\\n Career\\nHe was born with the name Calvin Grant Shofner on April 7, 1932, in Gans, Oklahoma, and was raised in Oakland California. He began his music career performing at the Remember Me Cafe in San Francisco at the age of fifteen, but he was not financially successful at first. Throughout the 1950s, he was not able to continue his music career, so he worked at various other jobs, including truck driving and bronco busting. He appeared on the California Hayride television show in the mid-1950s before serving two years in the military.\\n\\nAfter his discharge, he began playing in a band in the San Francisco Bay Area. In 1961, country music legend Ernest Tubb heard the band play and, after an audition, hired Smith to play guitar for the Texas Troubadours. Thus, Smith is heard playing in most of Tubb\\'s 1960s recordings. Smith\\'s stage name began to catch on after he released his first solo single, \"I\\'ll Just Go Home,\" in 1966 for Kapp Records, and he first cracked the Billboard charts with his second single, \"The Only Thing I Want.\"\\n\\nSmith permanently parted ways with Tubb and the Texas Troubadours in 1969, and he released his first solo album, Drinking Champagne, in 1969. The album\\'s title track had reached the Top 40 on the country charts the previous year.\\n\\nIn 1970, Smith signed with Decca Records, and his popularity quickly soared, starting off with his 1972 top 10 hit, \"I\\'ve Found Someone of My Own.\" He began recording songs written by some of the biggest names in the industry; for instance, in March 1973 his rendition of Bill Anderson\\'s \"The Lord Knows I\\'m Drinking\" became his first number-one country hit. When Decca became MCA Records in 1973, Cal enjoyed his biggest successes. In 1974, he recorded two of his greatest hits, \"It\\'s Time to Pay the Fiddler\" and \"Country Bumpkin,\" which received Song of the Year Awards from both the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association.\\n\\n\\n[edit] Later career\\nCal continued to have success with MCA Records into the late 70\\'s including the Top 20 singles \"Between Lust And Watching TV\" (1974), \"She Talked A Lot About Texas\" (1975), \"I Just Came Home To Count The Memories\" (1977), and \"Come See About Me\" (1977). After this he continued to have minor successes that included \"The Rise And Fall Of The Roman Empire\" in 1979.[citation needed]\\n\\nCal released his last album, Stories of Life by Cal Smith, in 1986 on Step One Records, where he scored a minor hit that year with \"King Lear\".[citation needed]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Life Today\\nSmith and his wife, Darlene, now reside in the Branson, Missouri area, where they pass a great deal of their time fishing.\\n\\n\\n[edit] Albums\\n1999 — Cal Smith \\n1994 — Lord Knows I\\'m Drinking \\n1986 — A Touch Away \\n1986 — Stories of Life by Cal Smith \\n1983 — Turn Me Loose \\n1977 — I Just Came Home to Count the Memories \\n1976 — Jason\\'s Farm \\n1975 — Cal\\'s Country \\n1975 — My Kind of Country \\n1975 — It\\'s Time to Pay the Fiddler \\n1974 — Country Bumpkin \\n1973 — Cal Smith \\n1972 — I\\'ve Found Someone of My Own \\n1971 — The Best of Cal Smith \\n1969 — Drinking Champagne \\n1968 — Travelin\\' Man \\n1967 — Goin\\' to Cal\\'s Place \\n1967 — All the World Is Lonely Now \\n\\n[edit] Awards\\n1974 — Academy of Country Music - Song of the Year \\n1974 — Country Music Association - Song of the Year \\n1974 — Country Music Association - Single of the Year <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cal+Smith\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Like countrymen the Mighty Bop and la Funk Mob, Cam is stylistically closest to Mo\\'Wax artists such as DJ Shadow and DJ Krush; minimalist, downbeat instrumental hip-hop built from obscure samples and stomp-box turntable accompaniment, bent and twisted into new, artfully arranged compositions.\\n\\nHis debut, 1994\\'s Underground Vibes, was released on the tiny French label Street Jazz and was followed by a live recording for the Inflammable imprint (one of only a few \"live\" recordings in a genre so reliant on the temporal concessions of the recording studio). Dubbed Underground Live, the album featured performed extrapolations of many of the tracks from his debut, as well as a few new and improvised tracks.

       " ' BIOGRAPHY             \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Early Years \\nMartin Campbell was born in Germany, in 1955. When he was two years old his family moved to Jamaica. He soon discovered a talent for music and by the age of seven was an accomplished pianist! After spending two years at the famous Alpha Boys\\' School, Martin moved on to Military school. He also joined the Sea Cadets where his aptitude for music was encouraged and he learnt to play the Side Drum and Bugle. \\n\\n\\nThe Sixties\\nDuring the mid sixties, Martin and his family moved to Halfway Tree. Around the same time he obtained his first (Grundig) tape recorder. His early recordings were of the songs he played on the piano – but it later lead to greater things! In 1968 the family moved to Southern England.\\n\\n\\nThe Seventies\\nWith Martin\\'s love of Jamaican music it wasn’t long before he began regularly picking up the latest Reggae releases from a local shop. Amongst his early influences, he cites Horace Andy, Dennis Brown, and Fred Locks. Martin says of the music of those times: “Back in those days, when they used real musicians, plus the combination of good quality recording equipment and techniques, the result was a very tight sound, with a very heavy bottom (Bass) end.” In 1979, Martin Campbell set up his first studio using a 4 track Teac recording deck combined with an Alice 8 track mixing desk. \\n\\nThe Eighties \\nOn a visit to Kingston in 1982, Martin checked out Channel One’s studio on Maxfield Avenue. The Hookim brothers were there recording, using a 2” 16 track tape machine and were in session with studio engineer, Barnabus at the controls. The sound that Barnabus was achieving blew Martin away! He decided then and there that this was the equipment to be used to achieve the ‘Yard Sound’ that he (and others) would like and respect. \\n\\nThe Birth of Channel One (UK) \\nOn a subsequent trip, Martin got to know Jo Jo Hookim, who was a major influential figure in his life. As a result of their conversation, the Channel One (UK)® label was set up as an outlet for Campbell’s work. \\n\\nThe Man on His Music \\nMartin Campbell outlines his philosophy on the music that he arranges, produces and sometimes sings, “My main aim is to continue to build and provide Roots-Reggae rhythms with a certain ‘feel’ or character for artists to voice. I think that the pace of the World is moving too fast and sometimes it’s nice just to slow the tempo a little. There’s plenty of the usual styles of music around, but I’d like to try and preserve something that’s more lasting and more permanent After all, why should everything sound the same? It just becomes boring and staid.” \\n\\n\\n\\nAn extract from \\'Martin Campbell - Rootsman\\' published by Mad Dog Publications (2002). The extract is from a transcription of an interview with Martin Campbell by J H Mason in December 1999 (Reggae Retro (UK) Ltd) \\nhttp://www.channeloneuk.co.uk/ \\nprovided by rUDe bOi_seLecTaH aka philosopher_SD <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Martin+Campbell\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Candyman is an American rapper and record producer who was one of the many crossover rap stars of the early 1990s, although his success was extremely short-lived. He is best known for his one-hit wonder, \"Knockin Boots\".\\n\\nThe Los Angeles rapper was featured backing Tone-Loc before he earned his own solo stint. His 1990 debut, Ain\\'t No Shame in My Game, scored a Top Ten pop hit with \"Knockin\\' Boots.\" The following year, he released another less successful LP for Epic, Playtime Is Over. He released I Thought U Knew for I.R.S. in 1993, which also failed to click. 2000 saw the release of Candyman\\'s Knockin\\' Boots 2001: A Sex Odyssey, an album featuring his 1990 hit single remixed and new cuts as well.\"[1]\\n\\nCandyman\\'s latest effort to revive his career, Knockin Boots 2001...

       " 'Born Germaine Williams in 1974 in Jamaica, Canibus moved to the United States with his mother at a young age. Because his mother\\'s career required constant relocation, the family moved frequently and the soon-to-be rapper found solace within himself. His rhetorical abilities blossomed later, once hip-hop became the guiding force in his life. He began rhyming and in the mid-\\'90s joined a group called T.H.E.M. (The Heralds of Extreme Metaphors.)\\n\\nThis group consisted also of his partner Webb. Following a fallout with his partner, Canibus pursued a solo career and began infiltrating the mix-tape circuit. By 1997, he had approached the brink of the major-label rap game, guesting regularly on high-profile releases: He contributed to \"Uni-4-orm,\" an inclusion on the Rhyme & Reason soundtrack also featuring Heltah Skeltah and Rass Kass; \"Love, Peace & Nappiness,\" an inclusion on the Lost Boyz\\'s Love, Peace & Nappiness also featuring Redman and A+; \"Making a Name for Ourselves,\" an inclusion on Common\\'s One Day It\\'ll All Make Sense; the non-album remix of Wyclef Jean\\'s \"Gone Till November.\"\\n\\nAnd most famously, \"4, 3, 2, 1,\" an inclusion on LL Cool J\\'s Phenomenon also featuring Redman, DMX, and Method Man.\\n\\nOf the several guest appearances, \"4, 3, 2, 1\" certainly meant the most, as it brought together many of New York\\'s preeminent hardcore rappers and thus ushered Canibus into that same elite class. At the same time, however, Canibus lashed out shortly afterward with the Mike Tyson-featuring \"Second Round K.O.,\" where he rhymed, \"So I\\'ma let the world know the truth, you don\\'t want me to shine/You studied my rhyme, then you laid your vocals after mine.\" \\n\\nIn fact, the entirety of the song directed barbed rhymes at LL: \"You walk around showin\\' off your body cause it sells/Plus to avoid the fact that you ain\\'t got skills/Mad at me \\'cause I kick that sh*t real niggaz feel/While 99 percent of your fans wear high heels,\" and so on. Shortly thereafter, LL sought his revenge, releasing \"The Ripper Strikes Back\" on the Survival of the Illest soundtrack (1998) and thus channeling even more attention toward Canibus. \\n\\nFrom the track\\'s chorus (\"Can-I-bus? Yes you can!\") to practically every line of the verses (\"You soft as a newborn baby takin\\' a nap/Make my dick hard with that bitch-ass track/Where you at? smokin\\' in some one-room flat/Suckin\\' on Clef\\'s dick hopin\\' to come back\"), LL unleashed a fury of insults and threats. The media, of course, elevated the battle to grand heights, as even MTV gave the story headlines. In the aftermath of 2Pac\\'s and Biggie\\'s deaths, such confrontations fascinated the rap community, and Canibus certainly capitalized on his newfound publicity.\\n\\nAs for his debut full-length, Can-i-bus (1998), though, the response was sobering. Critics expressed little support, and sales quickly dropped as listeners also felt genuinely disappointed. Executive produced by Wyclef, the album suffered on many levels, both production-wise and rhetorically as well (critics targeting Canibus\\' delivery more than his lyrics or themes). The momentum that \"Second Round K.O.\" had generated simmered almost immediately, and it didn\\'t help that LL\\'s \"Ripper Strikes Back\" found substantial acceptance at the time as well. \\n\\nIn the two years following the release of Can-i-bus, the rapper maintained an extremely low profile, much in contrast to the regular guest appearances he had made leading up to his debut. As a result, when he finally did return with his follow-up album, 2000 B.C. (2000), few noticed, it came and went generally unheard, and Canibus returned to the underground after parting ways with Universal. He continued to record albums and release them on the independent circuit (including 2002\\'s Mic Club, 2003\\'s Rip the Jacker, and 2005\\'s Mind Control); furthermore, he retained a small base of fans as well, yet his days as the next-big-thing had clearly come and gone, as they similarly had for so many other talented rappers. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Canibus\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Julian Edwin \"Cannonball\" Adderley (September 15, 1928 – August 8, 1975) was a jazz alto saxophonist of the hard bop era of the 1950s and 1960s.\\n\\nAdderley is remembered for his 1966 single \"Mercy Mercy Mercy\", a crossover hit on the pop charts, and for his work with trumpeter Miles Davis, including on the epochal album Kind of Blue (1959). He was the brother of jazz cornetist Nat Adderley, a longtime member of his band.\\n\\nThe name \\'Canonball\\' is supposed to have originated from his being nicknamed \\'cannibal\\' in his youth, on account of his prodigious eating\\n\\nEarly life and career\\nOriginally from Tampa, Florida, Adderley moved to New York in the mid-1950s. His nickname derived originally from \"cannibal\", a title imposed on him by high school colleagues as a tribute to his voracious appetite.\\n\\nHis educational career was long established prior to teaching applied instrumental music classes at Dillard High School in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Cannonball moved to Tallahassee, Florida when his parents obtained teaching positions at Florida A&M University. Both Cannonball and brother Nat played with Ray Charles when Charles lived in Tallahassee during the early 1940s. Cannonball was a local legend in Florida until he moved to New York City in 1955, where he lived in Corona, Queens.\\n\\nIt was in New York during this time that Adderley\\'s prolific career began. Adderley visited the Cafe Bohemia, where Oscar Pettiford\\'s group was playing that night. Adderley had brought his saxophone into the club with him, primarily because he feared that it would be stolen, and he was asked to sit in as the saxophone player was late. That performance established his reputation.\\n\\nPrior to joining Miles Davis\\' band, Adderley formed his own group with his brother Nat after signing onto the Savoy jazz label in 1957. He was noticed by Miles Davis, and it was because of his blues-rooted alto saxophone that Davis asked him to play with his group.\\n\\nAdderley joined the Miles Davis Sextet in October 1957, three months prior to John Coltrane\\'s return to the group. Adderley played on the seminal Davis records Milestones and Kind of Blue. This period also overlapped with pianist Bill Evans\\' time with the sextet, an association that led to recording Portrait of Cannonball and Know What I Mean?.\\n\\nHis interest as an educator carried over to his recordings. In 1961, Cannonball narrated The Child\\'s Introduction to Jazz, released on Riverside Records.\\n\\nBand leader\\nThe Cannonball Adderley Quintet featured Cannonball on alto sax and his brother Nat Adderley on cornet. Cannonball\\'s first quintet was not very successful; however, after leaving Davis\\' group, he formed another, again with his brother, which enjoyed more success.\\n\\nLater life\\nBy the end of the 1960s, Adderley\\'s playing began to reflect the influence of the electric jazz, avant-garde, and Davis\\' experiments on the album Bitches Brew. On his albums from this period, such as Accent on Africa (1968) and The Price You Got to Pay to Be Free (1970), he began doubling on soprano saxophone, showing the influence of Coltrane and Wayne Shorter. In that same year, his quintet appeared at the Monterey Jazz Festival in California, and a brief scene of that performance was featured in the 1971 psychological thriller Play Misty for Me, starring Clint Eastwood. In 1975 he also appeared (in an acting role alongside Jose Feliciano and David Carradine) in the episode \"Battle Hymn\" in the third season of the TV series Kung Fu.\\n\\nJoe Zawinul\\'s composition \"Cannon Ball\" (recorded on Weather Report\\'s album Black Market) is a tribute to his former leader. Pepper Adams and George Mraz dedicated the composition \"Julian\" on the 1975 Pepper Adams album (also called \"Julian\") days after Cannonball\\'s death.\\n\\nSongs made famous by Adderley and his bands include \"This Here\" (written by Bobby Timmons), \"The Jive Samba\", \"Work Song\" (written by Nat Adderley), \"Mercy, Mercy, Mercy\" (written by Joe Zawinul) and \"Walk Tall\" (written by Zawinul, Marrow and Rein). A cover version of Pops Staples\\' \"Why (Am I Treated So Bad)?\" also entered the charts.\\n\\nAdderley was initiated as an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity (Gamma Theta chapter, University of North Texas, \\'60, & Xi Omega chapter, Frostburg State University, \\'70) and Alpha Phi Alpha (Beta Nu chapter, Florida A&M University).\\n\\nAdderley died of a stroke in 1975. He was buried in the Southside Cemetery, Tallahassee, Florida. Later that year he was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cannonball+Adderley\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'King Shango, King David, The Fireman and The Prophet.\\n\\nA wise man once said that a prophet is not without honour save in his own country and so it has been with Capleton. While the veteran DJ\\'s words and works long ago earned him the title of \"The Prophet\", the respect and honor that should rightfully be his have been a long time coming. \"Anytime you try to uplift righteousness and upliftment of the people them, then you ah go get a fight\", says the hottest entertainer in the worldwide reggae fraternity. \"Bob Marley come do it and them fight him. And when Bob Marley dead, that\\'s when they start to endorse him. I already aware of this, I am not unaware. So I know the more them fight I is the more I get stronger\" In the fast-moving world of dancehall reggae, fame and success are hard to obtain and easy to lose. Fans can be fickle, and trends change in the blink of an eye, leaving most entertainers with painfully short career spans. Only a rare few can remain relevant from year to year, holding their audience\\'s attention and leaving them crying for more. His lyrics are deep, precise, and thoughtful. His stage shows are nothing less than dynamic, explosive performances. But his remarkable staying power and longevity may be Capleton\\'s greatest gift.\\n\\nBorn Clifton George Bailey III on April 13, 1967, in the rural parish of St. Mary, Capleton earned his future stage name from friends who were so impressed with his sharp reasoning skills that they named him after the most famous lawyer in town. From a tender young age, he was a lover of the traveling sound systems, sneaking out at night to catch the vibes until dawn. But it wasn\\'t until he turned 18 and moved to Kingston that he was able to realize his destiny.\\n\\nIt was Stewart Brown, owner of a Toronto-based sound called African Star, who gave the untested artist his first break, flying him to Canada for a stage show alongside giants like Ninjaman and Flourgon. The audience poured out their appreciation, and he never looked back. When Capleton first burst on the scene in the late 1980s, the dancehall was a very different place than it is today. Slackness and gun talk were the order of the day. This bright promising newcomer announced his arrival with a string of hit songs from \"Bumbo Red\" to \"Number One on the Look Good Chart\" and \"Lotion Man.\" Everything he touched hit the sound-good charts, and the youthful artist with the nimble vocabulary and hardcore voice quickly established himself as one of dancehall\\'s most reliable hitmakers. But even he could not have predicted that eleven years later, at the start of the new millennium, he would be dancehall\\'s ruling voice.\\n\\n\"I think the people dem see say me really deserve that because of the amount of years me put in,\" Capleton says, \"and we never really bow and we still hold the faith. We stand up for whatever we a say. Yeah and we really work for it. And them say by your works, a so you get your pay. The people them see the amount of fight me face and the whole heap of accusation. And me still never give up\"\\n\\nWhen he dropped the tune \"Alms House\" in 1992, Capleton established himself as more than an entertainer but as a guiding light of righteousness through music. \"United we stand and divided we fall,\" he sang for the benefit of his fans and dancehall comrades. \"Nuff of them nah go know themself till them back against the wall.\" A few years later he came back with yet another antidote to the clashing and rivlary that had taken hold of the dancehall business. \"Music is a mission,\" he reminded his fellow artists, \"not a competition. Some man use the music to cause confusion.\" The path of this dancehall Prophet was clearly established in 1994 with a string of songs that declared his newfound faith in Rastafari. \"INI sight up the light and see say really, yunno, Rasta is real,\" he recalls. \"founder of the world, because Rasta did come set the trend. Y\\'unnerstand. Rasta is life.\"\\n\\nThe first words of his mega-hit \"Dis The Trinity\" made it plain that the DJ had experienced some kind of revelation. \"I was once lost but now I\\'m found,\" he stated, \"Selassie I live every time.\" Capleton became a strong advocate of the teaching of the Jamaican National Hero, Marcus Mosiah Garvey, founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and advocate of universal black repatriation. \"Babylon rewarded us with hatred for our love,\" he declares. \"They taught us to rape, steal and kill. For instance, they stole our literature and taught it back to us in a different manner so as to infiltrate our minds with foolishness and other misconceptions. Now we as black men do not see ourselves as prince and prophets, but as punks and guys. Our women do not see themselves as queens, princesses or empresses anymore, but as harlots and concubines.\" The only solution, as Bob Marley advocated, is to emancipate oneself from mental slavery.\\n\\n\"Over the years INI as a nation and a people, them no really teach INI nuttin\\' bout INI black self. You know I mean? Them teach INI them give we European philosophy. So INI and some other youths a try emerge now, we ask certain question and we ask fi certain things. Caw we know say an institute, or in a college, or in a certain organization we need we Ethiopian curriculum, we need the black man thing. We need to know about weself. Becaw the prophet Marcus Garvey did show we say, A nation without no knowledge of them own history is like a tree without a root. And if you don\\'t know where you\\'re coming from, you\\'re not gonna know where you\\'re going.\"\\n\\nEven as he uplifts the black race, Capleton always makes a point of clarifying that he does not seek to alienate any race. \"We are not being racial nor prejudiced star,\" he says. \"Becaw we know Jah is for everyone. But where history and prophesy in concerned, that is our witness and we have to be ourself, and we cannot hide from the truth. Caw we woulda be a traitor and a sellout to ourself. And you cannot sell out yourself.\"\\n\\nSoon thereafter came the song \"Tour\" a blazing state of the dancehall report written in the weeks following the slaying of Panhead and Dirtsman, two of Capleton\\'s fellow artists. That song not only became an anthem of the roots revival within the dancehall, but a hip hop flavored remix of that song hit the Billboard charts, opening up a huge new audience to Capleton\\'s messages of righteousness.\\n\\nThere followed a relationship with Def Jam records, who released two Capleton albums, Prophecy and I-Testament, which featured memorable collaborations with rap stars like Method Man and Q-Tip. Both records were warmly accepted by the international audience, but as the millennium drew to a close, Capleton sensed that it was time to return to his core audience. He had work to do. \"I have to be myself, right? And I only can be me,\" he reasons. \"So whichever way fi make me be me, I work with dat. Y\\'understand.\"\\n\\nCapleton is now at the height of his powers. 1999 and 2000 have brought a ceaseless string of sound system favorite and dancehall chart toppers like the anti-violence anthem \"Jah Jah City\" and \"Good In Her Clothes,\" a message of respect for the sisters who carry themselves like Empresses rather than. But even as he completes his mission of upliftment, Capleton has had many critics. One of his biggest hits, in fact, is addressed the naysayers in the press and the ivory towers of power. \"Critics won\\'t leave I alone,\" chats the Prophet. \"They say they can\\'t take the fire weh me put pon Rome\"\\n\\nMany of Capleton\\'s songs \"and most of his critics\" make mention of this blazing fire. Capleton hopes to clear up the confusion once and for all. \"Is not really a physical fire. Is really a spiritual fire, and a wordical fire, and a musical fire. You see the fire is all about a livity. But is people get it on the wrong term. People get confused.So when a man say \"more fire\" him think that mean say you fi go light the cane field or go light the church.\" Fire, Capleton explains, is a way of reminding one\\'s brother that they are going astray. \"That way a man know say him doing something wrong. That even give him the urge to know say Yo check up on yourself. What you\\'re doing is not right, or else him would not say \"Fire fi dat,\" or \"Burn dat\" or \"More fire.\"  \"If we go check it back now,\" he continues, \"fire is for the purification of earth, anyhow you check it. This earth itself have to even emerge from the literal fire also, which is the volcanic activity, we a talk bout lava. The hottest element to rise us in the morning is the sun. The water cleanse, but it\\'s still the support from the fire that burn the water, burn out of the bacteria so the water coulda heal we fi cleanse. The herb heal, but it\\'s still the fire fi burn the herb so the herb coulda heal we also.\"\\n\\n{Bio is courtesy of Rob Kenner} www.vprecords.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Capleton\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'José Álvaro Osorio Balvin (born May 7, 1985), known professionally as J Balvin, is a Colombian reggaeton singer. Balvin was born in Medellín, Colombia, where he became interested in music at a young age. At age 17, he moved to the United States and learned English, which influenced the music he would make later. He then returned to Medellín and gained local popularity by performing at various clubs around the city.\\n\\nThough his music is primarily reggaeton, J Balvin has experimented with a variety of musical genres in his work, including electronica, house music, trap, and R&B. He has collaborated with artists such as Pharrell Williams, Major Lazer, and Sean Paul. Despite working with many English-speaking artists, J Balvin continues to sing almost exclusively in Spanish, and hopes to introduce Spanish-language music to a global audience. He is also noted for his eclectic and colorful fashion sense. \\n\\nBalvin\\'s breakthrough came in 2014 with the single \"6 AM\" featuring Puerto Rican singer Farruko which peaked at.

In June 2017, J Balvin released the single \"Mi Gente\" with Willy William, which achieved international success and later reached one billion views on YouTube. This preceded the release of his fifth full-length album, titled Vibras, the concept for which was developed from the moment \"Mi Gente\" started \"connecting with audiences around the world,\" presented as a fusion of reggaeton with different worldwide styles and rhythms. It received favorable reviews from critics and audiences alike, with Juana Giaimo of The Guardian praising the sound of the reggaeton music on the album by calling it \"smooth\" and \"sensual\", and dubbing it the \"perfect party playlist, [which] confirms that the noisy style of early reggaeton hits such as Daddy Yankee\\'s \\'Gasolina\\' is slowly being left behind.\"\\n\\nHe has also collaborated with Cardi B and Bad Bunny on the US Billboard Hot 100 number-one single \"I Like It\".  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/J+Balvin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He is the founder of his own record label and rap collective, Only the Family (OTF).\\n\\nBeginning his career, from 2011 to 2012, Durk released his debut, un-official mixtape, I’m a Hitta which was released on August 26, 2011. On April 3, 2012, Durk released his sophomore mixtape, a sequel to his previous tape, I’m Still a Hitta. Durka later released his third mixtape on November 5, 2012, titled Life Ain’t No Joke\\n\\nLike many drill artists, Durk’s early career was plagued with legal issues and accusations of violence. These issues eventually led to his shows being canceled.\\n\\nFrom 2013 to 2015 Durk released a total of four projects, three mixtapes, and an album. October 10, 2013, marked the release of the first Signed to the Streets, one of Durk’s most notable mixtapes and the start of a series. In the summer of 2014, specifically July 4, Durk released a sequel to Signed to the Streets and released Signed to the Streets 2 featuring his “What You Do to Me”.\\n\\n2015 would be an enormous year for Lil Durk as in July 2015, Durk released his debut studio album, Remember My Name which featured his Jeremih-assisted “Like Me.” Later that year, Durk released his sixth mixtape 300 Days 300 Nights which included his then-girlfriend, Dej Loaf-assisted, “My Beyoncé.”\\n\\nFrom 2016 to 2017, Durk released a total of four solo projects and one collaborative project. On July 22, 2016, Durk released his sophomore studio album, Lil Durk 2X accompanied by features such as Future, Young Thug, Yo Gotti and more. Ending the year, Durk released They Forgot, his seventh mixtape.\\n\\nBeginning 2017, in February, Durk released his seventh mixtape, Love Songs for the Streets, which is deemed as one of his most notable projects including features from Moneybagg Yo and YFN Lucci. Later that year in August, Durk released a collaborative EP with Lil Reese titled Supa Vultures; the project included his “Nobody Knows”. On October 19, 2017, Durk carried on with his Signed to the Streets series with the highly anticipated Signed to the Streets 2.5. The mixtape included the start of yet another song series titled “India” dedicated to his fiancé India Cox otherwise known as India Royale.\\n\\nIn 2018, Durk released two projects, he began with Just Cause Y\\'all Waited, Durk’s highest-charting mixtape peaking at #57 on the Billboard 200. Durk then released a sequel to Love Songs for the Streets titled Love Songs 4 the Streets 2. Durk was extremely successful prior to this album, however, many say that this exact album broke Durk into the mainstream rap industry as it had been his first project to chart in the top 10 of the Billboard 200.\\n\\n2020 was an even better year for Lil Durk as he released his almost chart-topping Just Cause Y’all Waited 2 which peaked at #2 on the Billboard 200. It was later followed up with a deluxe.\\n\\nThe scars of violence run deep in Durk’s discography, particularly arising from the loss of OTF members Nunu (Nuski) and King Von at the hands of gunfire. Both artists are commemorated on his album The Voice, for which a deluxe version was released in 2021.\\n\\nAnointing himself as the voice of the streets, Durk followed up this project with the release of the collaborative album The Voice of the Heroes with Lil Baby which brought the Chicago native artist his first #1 album.\\n\\nMarking his first solo #1 album, in March 2022, Lil Durk released a melodramatic take on the deaths of his loved ones through an album titled 7220. The album became Durk’s first solo project to top the charts. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lil+Durk\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Caribou is Canadian Dan Snaith (b. 1978), who formerly recorded under the moniker Manitoba. Known for altering his sound with each subsequent release, he incorporates electronic psychedelia, krautrock rhythms, and breakbeat drums and creates a swirling, lush, musical panorama. Snaith also creates more club-oriented dance music under the name Daphni.\\n\\nSnaith grew up in Dundas, Ontario, Canada, which gave its name to a song from his debut album Start Breaking My Heart. He studied at the University of Toronto as an undergrad, but was based in the UK for several years until he completed his Ph.D. in mathematics at the Imperial College, London in 2005.\\n\\nSnaith previously recorded under the stage name \"Manitoba\", but changed it under threat of a lawsuit by Handsome \"Dick\" Manitoba, frontman for The Dictators, a punk-rocker with an appetite for litigation. Uninterested in the legal stoush, Snaith is quoted saying that he chose the new moniker \"Caribou\" while on an LSD trip with friends in the Canadian wilderness. He then climbed a tree and didn\\'t come down until he finished his first album under the new moniker, which was four months later.\\n\\nHe has recorded five full lengths: Start Breaking My Heart, a jazzy, \"folktronica\" IDM album, Up in Flames, the critically acclaimed shoegazer with analog synths and sometimes live, sometimes sampled drums, The Milk of Human Kindness, his krautrock-inspired album that bleeds 70\\'s prog and 70\\'s drugscapes, the psychedelic pop record, Andorra which landed him the prestigious 2008 Polaris Music Prize on September 29th, 2008 and Swim a disco / dance inspired album created from the idea of making dance music that sounds like being under water. A few years prior to the recording of the album, Snaith\\'s wife gave him swimming lessons as a Christmas present, prompting him to take it up as a new hobby. This partially led to the eventual ideology behind Swim.\\n\\nHis eclectic live performances are renowned, in part for their use of simultaneous drummers and synchronised visuals.  The live band currently consists of Dan Snaith (guitar, keyboards, vocals, drums, flutophone), Ryan Smith (guitar, keyboards), Brad Weber (drums) and John Schmersal (bass, vocals). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Caribou\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

German rock guitarist and songwriter from Irhove, Leer, Germany.\\n\\n1. Carl Carlton (b. 1953) is an American R&B, soul, and funk singer and songwriter best known for his hits \"Everlasting Love\" and \"She\\'s a Bad Mama Jama (She\\'s Built, She\\'s Stacked)\".\\n\\nCarlton, born in Detroit, Michigan, first began recording in the late 1960\\'s as \"Little Carl\" Carlton, a likely marketing ploy to capitalize on some vocal similarities to established hitmaker Stevie Wonder, who also hails from Detroit and had recorded under the name \"Little Stevie\" Wonder in the early 60\\'s. After scoring some minor local hits, Carlton was signed by Don D. Robey and moved to Houston, Texas, the home of his new record label, Back Beat Records. Carlton saw some success with the new label including his first major hit, a disco-tinged remake of Robert Knight\\'s \"Everlasting Love\" that went to #6 on the U.S. pop music charts.\\n\\nRobey sold his labels to ABC Records in 1972, and in 1976 Carlton became embroiled in a royalty dispute with the new ownership that caused him to stop recording for some time. He then signed with Mercury Records in 1977, but only released one single on that label. Carlton was unable to land a new record deal for several years until Leon Haywood helped him get a singles deal with 20th Century Records. A Haywood-penned single, \"She\\'s a Bad Mama Jama\", became a major hit, peaking at #2 on the pop charts and earning Carlton a Grammy Award nomination for Best R&B Vocal Performance, Male. Carlton\\'s subsequent album, Carl Carlton, went gold in 1981. \"She\\'s a Bad Mama Jama\" has since become a staple of compilation albums and soundtracks and is often sampled in rap music.\\n\\nCarlton released several more albums in the 80\\'s but had only a few minor R&B hits, and eventually fell out of favor with record companies and out of the public eye. After 1985\\'s Private Property, he did not release another album until 1994\\'s Main Event, which failed to chart.\\n\\nIn late 2002, Carlton appeared with many R&B superstars on the \"Rhythm, Love, and Soul\" edition of the PBS series American Soundtrack.

       " '\\nCarl Perkins (April 9, 1932 - January 19 1998) was an American rockabilly singer, guitarist and songwriter, performing early Rockabilly and Rock n Roll along with more traditional Country and Gospel music for decades before his death at age 65. His best known song was \"Blue Suede Shoes\" in 1956 which was the first single to top three charts listed by Billboard Magazine - popular, country and western, and rhythm and blues. Perkins had a long association with musical collaborator Johnny Cash, and was a an influence on numerous artists including The Beatles, and the Rolling Stones. \\nA highly regarded and influential American pioneer of rockabilly music, a mix of rhythm and blues and country music, recorded most notably at Sun Records in Memphis, beginning in 1954. An outstanding performer, his touch on rock and roll music is still heard to this day.\\nAccording to country musician  Charlie Daniels, \"Carl Perkins\\' songs personified the Rockabilly Era, and Carl Perkins\\' sound personifies the Rockabilly Sound more so than anybody involved in it, because he never changed.\"  Perkins\\'s songs have been recorded by artists as influential as Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Johnny Cash, which further cemented his place in the history of popular music.\\n\\nCarl Lee Perkins was the son of poor sharecroppers near Tiptonville, Tennessee. He grew up hearing Southern gospel music sung by whites in church and by black field workers when he started working in the cotton fields at age six. In the spring and fall, the school day would be followed by several hours of work in the fields. During the summer workdays were 12 - 14 hours, \"from can to can\\'t\". Carl and his brother Jay together would earn 50 cents per day. With all family members working, and credit, there was enough money for beans and potatoes, some tobacco for Carl\\'s father Buck, and every so often the luxury of a five cent bag of hard candy.\\n\\nOn Saturday nights he would listen to the radio along with his father and hear music from the Grand Ole Opry. Roy Acuff\\'s broadcast performances on the Opry inspired Perkins to ask his parents for a guitar.  Because they couldn\\'t afford a real guitar, Carl\\'s father fashioned one from a cigar box and a broomstick. When a neighbor in tough straits offered to sell his dented and scratched Gene Autry signature model guitar with worn out strings, Buck purchased it for a couple of dollars. For the next year Carl taught himself parts of Roy Acuff\\'s \"Great Speckled Bird\" and \"The Wabash Cannonball\", which he had heard on the Opry. Perkins also cites the sped up, driving. straight time playing and detached but determined, wispy but challenging vocals of Bill Monroe as an early influence.\\n\\nCarl began learning more about playing his guitar from a fellow field worker named John Westbrook who befriended him. \"Uncle John\", as Carl called him, was an African American in his sixties who played blues and gospel on his battered acoustic guitar. Most famously, \"Uncle John\" advised Carl when playing the guitar to \"Get down close to it. You can feel it travel down the strangs, come through your head and down to your soul where you live. You can feel it. Let it vib-a-rate.\" Because Carl couldn\\'t afford new strings when they broke, he retied them. The knots would cut into his fingers when he tried to slide to another note, so he began bending the notes, stumbling onto a type of blue note.\"\\n\\nCarl was recruited to be a member of the Lake County Fourth Grade Marching Band, and because of the Perkins\\' limited finances, was given a new white shirt, cotton pants, white band cap and red cape by Miss Lee McCutcheon, who was in charge of the band.\\n\\nIn January of 1947, Buck Perkins moved his family from Lake County to Madison County. A replacement radio which ran on electricity rather than battery, and the nearness of Memphis made it possible for Carl to hear a wider variety of music.\\n\\nAt age fourteen, using the I IV V chord progression common to country songs of the day, he wrote a song that would be known as \"Let Me Take You To the Movie, Magg\" around Jackson. (The same song would convince Sam Phillips to sign Perkins to his Sun Records label.)\\n\\n\\nBeginnings as a Performer:\\nPerkins and his brother Jay had their first paying job (in tips) as entertainment at the \"CottonBoll\" on Highway 45 some twelve miles south of Jackson, TN starting on Wednesday nights in late 1946. Carl was only fourteen years old. One of the songs they played was an uptempo, country blues shuffle version of Bill Monroe\\'s \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\". Free drinks were one of the perks of playing in a honky tonk, and Carl drank four beers that first night. Within a month Carl and Jay began playing Friday and Saturday nights at the Sand Ditch near the western boundary of Jackson. Both places were the scene of frequent fights, and both of the Perkins Brothers gained a reputation as fighters. \\n\\nIn the next couple of years the Perkins Brothers began playing other tonks, including El Rancho, The Roadside Inn, and the Hilltop, around Bemis and Jackson as they became a big draw. Carl talked his brother Clayton into playing the bass fiddle to fill in the sound of the band.[13] Carl began appearing regularly on Jackson radio station WTJS in the late forties as a sometime member of the Tennessee Ramblers. He also appeared on another show, Hayloft Frolic, where he performed two single songs; sometime including \"talking Blues\" as done by Robert Lunn on the Grand Ole Opry. Carl, and then his brothers began appearing on The Early Morning Farm and Home Hour. Overwhelmingly positive listener response led to a fifteen minute segment sponsored by Mother\\'s Best Flour. By the end of the 40s, the Perkins Brothers were in a league of their own as the best known band in the Jackson area.\\n\\nCarl had day jobs during most of these early years, working first at picking cotton, then at Day\\'s Dairy in Malesus, then a mattress factory, and in then a battery plant. He then began as a pan greaser at the Colonial Baking Company and worked there from 1951 through 1952.\\n\\nIn January of 1953 Carl married a woman he had known for a number of years, Valda Crider. When his job at the bakery was reduced to part time, Valda, who had her own job at the time, encouraged Carl to begin working the tonks full time. Carl began playing six night a week. Late in the same year he added W.S. \"Fluke\" Holland, who had no previous experience as a musician, but a good sense of rhythm, to the band as a drummer.\\n\\nIn July of 1954, Perkins and his wife, Valda, heard a new release of \"[Blue Moon of Kentucky\" by Elvis Presley, Scotty, and Bill on the radio.[18] Valda exclaimed, \"Listen! They play like y\\'all! It sounds like you!\" After recording the take of the song that was released, Presley exclaimed, \"That sounds like Carl Perkins!\". As \"Blue Moon of Kentucky faded out, Carl said, \"There\\'s a man in Memphis who understands what we\\'re doing. I need to go see him.\"\\n\\n\\nSun Records era:\\n\\nPerkins successfully auditioned for Sam Phillips at Sun Records early in October of 1954. \"Movie Magg\" and \"Turn Around\" were released on the Phillips owned Flip label (151) March 19, 1955 hit. with \"Turn Around\" becoming a regional.  With \"Turn Around\" getting airplay across the South and Southwest, Perkins was booked to appear along with Elvis Presley at theaters in Mariana and West Memphis, Arkansas. Commenting on the audience reaction to both Presley and himself Perkins said, \"When I\\'d jump around they\\'d scream some, but they were gettin\\' ready for him. It was like TNT, man, it just exploded. All of a sudden the world was wrapped up in rock.\"\\n\\nJohnny Cash and the Tennessee Two were the next musicians to be added to the performances by Sun musicians. Over the summer of \\'55 there were trips to Little Rock, Forrest City, Corinth, and Tupelo. Again performing at El Rancho, the Perkins brothers were involved in an automobile accident. A friend, who had been driving, was pinned by the steering wheel. Perkins managed to drag him from the car, which had caught on fire. Clayton had been thrown from the car, but was not seriously injured.\"\\n\\nAnother Perkins\\' tune \"Gone Gone Gone\", released in October 1955 by Sun, was also a regional hit. It was backed by the more traditional \"Let The Juke Box Keep On Playing\", complete with fiddle, \"Western Boogie\" bass line, steel guitar, and weepy vocal.\\n\\nThat same fall of 1955, Perkins wrote the song \"Blue Suede Shoes\" after seeing a dancer at a honky-tonk get mad at his date for scruffing up his blue suede shoes. Several weeks later, on December 19, 1955, Perkins and his band recorded the song during a session at the Sun studios in Memphis. Phillips suggested changes to the lyrics (\"Go Cat Go\") and the band changed the end of the song to a boogie vamp. During the long session, as liquor flowed, the sound became tougher, harder and looser, and Perkins played with passion. Phillips knew he had found the right song to bring out the blues strain in Perkins\\' music and produce a pop hit. Elvis Presley left Sun for a larger opportunity with RCA in November, and on December 19, 1955, Phillips, who had begun recording Perkins in late 1954, told Perkins, \"Carl Perkins, you\\'re my rockabilly cat now\". \\n\\nReleased on January 1, 1956, \"Blue Suede Shoes\" was a massive chart success. In the United States, it went to #1 on Billboard magazine\\'s country music charts (the only #1 hit he would have) and to #2 on Billboard\\'s Best Sellers pop music chart. Finally, on March 17, Perkins became the first country artist to reach the #3 spot on the rhythm & blues charts. In the United Kingdom, it became a Top Ten hit. It was the first record by a Sun label artist to sell a million copies. \\n\\n\\nThe Accident:\\n\\nAfter playing a show in Norfolk, VA on March 21, 1956, the Perkins Brothers Band headed for New York City and their appearance on the nationally broadcast Perry Como Show. Shortly before sunrise near Dover, Delaware Stuart Pinkham (aka Dick Stuart, and Poor Richard) assumed the duties as driver. After running head on into the back of a pickup truck, their car ended up in a ditch of water about a foot deep, and Carl was lying face down in the water. Drummer W.C. Holland rolled Carl over, saving him from drowning. Carl had suffered 3 fractured vertebrae in his neck, a severe concussion, a broken collar bone, and lacerations all over his body in the crash. Carl remained unconscious for an entire day. The driver of the pickup, Thomas Phillips, a forty year old farmer, died when he was thrown into the steering wheel of his pickup. Carl\\'s brother Jay had a fractured neck along with severe internal injuries.\\n\\nOn March 23 Bill Black, Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana visited Carl on their way to New York to appear with Elvis the next day. Bill Black told Carl, \"Hey, man, Elvis sends his love\", and lit a cigarette for him, in spite of the fact that the patient in the next bed was in an oxygen tent. A week later, Carl was given a telegram, which had actually arrvied on the 23rd, from Elvis wishing him a speedy recovery.\\n\\nSam Philips had planned to surprise Perkins with a gold record during the Perry Como show. \"Shoes\" had already sold more than 500,000 copies by March 22. Now, while Carl recuperated from the accident, \"Blue Suede Shoes\" rose to number one on most pop, R&B, and country regional charts. It also held the number two positon on the Billboard Hot 100 and country charts. Elvis Presley\\'s \"Heartbreak Hotel\" held the number one position on the pop and country charts, while \"Shoes\" did better than \"Heartbreak\" on the R&B charts. By Mid-April, more than one million copies of \"Shoes\" had been sold.\\n\\nOn April 3, while still out of commission, but back in Jackson, Perkins would see his friend Elvis Presley perform \"Blue Suede Shoes\" on his first Milton Berle Show appearance. Presley performed the song on national television 3 times that year, and made references to it twice during an appearance on The Steve Allen Show. Although his version became more famous than Perkins\\', it only reached #20 on Billboard\\'s pop chart.\\n\\n\\nReturn to Recording and Touring:\\n\\nPerkins returned to live performances on April 21 of the same year beginning with an appearance in Beaumont, Texas with the \"Big D Jamboree\" tour.\\n\\nBefore resuming life on the road, Sam Phillips arranged a recording session at Sun with Ed Cisco filling in for the still recuperating Jay. By mid-April \"Dixie Fried\", \"Put Your Cat Clothes On\", \"Right String, Wrong Yo-Yo\", \"You Can\\'t Make Love to Somebody\", \"Everybody\\'s Trying to Be My Baby\", and \"That Don\\'t Move Me\" had been recorded.\\n\\nPerkins was paid $1,000 to play just two songs a night on the extended tour of \"Top Stars of \\'56\" beginning in early summer. A couple of the other performers on this tour were Chuck Berry, and Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers. When Perkins and the group took the stage in Columbia, SC, Carl was appalled to see a teenager with a bleeding chin pressed against the stage by the crowd. During the first guitar break of \"Honey Don\\'t\" they were waved off stage and into a vacant dressing room behind a double line of police officers. Carl is quoted as saying, \"It was dangerous. Lot of kids got hurt. There was a lot of rioting going on, just crazy, man! The music drove \\'em insane.\" Appalled by what he had seen and experienced, Carl left the tour. \\n\\nSun issued more Perkins\\' songs in 1956: Boppin\\'The Blues/All Mama\\'s Children (Sun 243), Dixie Fried/I\\'m Sorry, I\\'m Not Sorry (Sun 249). Matchbox/All Mama\\'s Children (Sun 261) came out in February of 1957.  Matchbox is considered to be a rockabilly classic, and George Thorogood and the Destroyers covered \"Dixie Fried\" on their 1985 album Maverick.\\n\\nThe day Matchbox was recorded, Elvis Presley visited the studio. Along with Johnny Cash (who left early), Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Presley spent more than an hour singing gospel, country and rhythm-and-blues songs while a tape rolled. The casual session was called The Million Dollar Quartet by a local newspaper the next day, and was eventually released on a disk in 1990.\\n\\nThe 1957 film Jamboree includes a Perkins performance of Glad All Over that runs 1:55. Glad All Over, written by Schroeder, Tepper, and Bennett, was released by Sun in January of 1958. Perkins also made at least two appearances on the Town Hall Party in Compton, CA in 1957. singing both Blues Suede Shoes and Matchbox. Those performances were included in the \"Western Ranch Dance Party\" series filmed and distributed by Screen Gems.\\n\\n\\nLife after Sun:\\n\\nIn 1958, Perkins moved to Columbia Records where he recorded songs such as: Jive at Five, Anyway the Wind Blows, Hambone, Pointed Toe Shoes and Sister Twister.\\n\\nThe Golden Nugget Casino in Las Vegas was the site of many performances in 1962 along with appearances in 9 mid Western states and a tour of Germany. Appearances at The Golden Nugget continued through 1963.\\n\\nIn May of 1964 Perkins toured England along with Chuck Berry, and Eric Burdon and The Animals backed the two stars from the States On the last night of the tour, he attended a party that turned out to be for him, and ended up sitting on the floor sharing stories, playing guitar, and singing songs while surrounded by The Beatles: John, Paul, George, and Ringo; who were at the time the hottest group in the world. Ringo asked Carl if he could record \"Honey Don\\'t.\" \"Man,\" answered Carl, \"go ahead, have at it.\" The Beatles, would cover \"Matchbox\", \"Honey Don\\'t\", and also \"Everybody\\'s Trying to Be My Baby\" recorded by Perkins but written by, and originally recorded by, Rex Griffin. Glad All Over, also performed by Perkins, but not written by him, and not to be confused with The Dave Clark Five song of the same name, was also covered. Another tour to Germany followed in the fall.\\n\\nAlthough he had been trying to rehabilitate himself by only drinking beer (but lots of it), in 1968, while on tour with the Johnny Cash troupe, Perkins began a four day drunk in Tulsa, OK starting with a bottle of Early Times. Nevertheless, with the urging of Cash, he opened a show in San Diego by playing four songs after seeing \"four or five of me in the mirror\", and while being able to see \"nothin\\' but a blur\". After drinking yet another pint of Early Times, he passed out on the tour bus. By morning he started hallucinating \"big spiders, and dinosaurs, huge, and they were gonna step on me.\" The bus was now parked on a beach at the ocean. He was tempted by yet another pint of whiskey that he had hidden on the bus. He took the bottle with him onto the beach and fell on his knees and said, \"Lord... I\\'m gonna throw this bottle. I\\'m gonna show You that I believe in You.\" I sailed it into the Pacific... I got up, I knew I had done the right thing.\" Perkins and Cash, who had his own problems with drugs, then gave each other support to stay away from their drug of choice.\\n\\nIn 1968, Johnny Cash took the Perkins-written \"Daddy Sang Bass\" (based upon the American standard \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\") to #1 on the country music charts. \"Daddy Sang Bass\" was also a Country Music Association nominee for Song of the Year. Perkins spent a decade in Cash\\'s singer touring revue and appeared on The Johnny Cash Show. Perkins played \"MatchBox\" along with Cash and with Eric Clapton and band mates (Derek and the Dominoes). Cash also featured Perkins in rehearsal jamming with José Feliciano and Merle Travis.\\n\\nA Kraft Music Hall episode hosted by Johnny Cash had Perkins singing his song \"Restless\"[17] on April 16, 1969.[18] Country music fans may recognize The Statler Brothers\\' song \"Flowers on the Wall\", which was also featured on this show. In February of 1969 Perkins joined with Bob Dylan to write the song \"Champaign, Illinois\". Dylan was recording in Nashville from February 12 through February 21 for an album that would be titled Nashville Skyline, and met Perkins when he appeared on The Johnny Cash Show on June 7.[19] Dylan had written one verse of a song, but was stuck. After Perkins worked out a loping rhythm and improvised a verse ending lyric, Dylan said, \"Your song. Take it. Finish it.\"[41] The co authored song was included in Perkins\\' 1969 album \"On Top\". \\n\\nPerkins was also united in 1969 by Columbia\\'s Murray Krugman with a long-hair rockabilly group based in New York\\'s Hudson Valley, the New Rhythm and Blues Quartet. Carl and NRBQ recorded \"Boppin\\' the Blues\" which featured the New York band backing Perkins on some songs like his staples \"Turn Around\" and \"Boppin\\' the Blues\" and included songs recorded separately by Carl and NRBQ. \\n\\nOne of his TV appearances with Cash was on the popular country series Hee Haw in an episode aired February 16, 1974.\\n\\nIn 1981 Perkins recorded the song \\'Get It\\' with Paul McCartney, providing vocals and playing guitar with the former Beatle. This recording was included on the chart topping album Tug Of War released in 1982.[20] This track also appeared as the B-side of the title track single in a slightly edited form. One source states that Perkins \"wrote the song with Paul McCartney\".\\n\\nThe rockabilly revival of the 1980s helped bring Perkins back into the limelight. In 1985, he re-recorded \"Blue Suede Shoes\" with two members of the Stray Cats, as part of the soundtrack for the movie, Porky\\'s Revenge. That same year, George Harrison, Eric Clapton, and Ringo Starr appeared with him on a television special taped in London, England, called Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session. Perkins and his friends ended the session by singing his signature song, 30 years after its writing, which brought Perkins to tears.\\n\\nIn 1985, Perkins was inducted to the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and in 1987, wider recognition of his contribution to music came with his induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In addition, \"Blue Suede Shoes\" was chosen as one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\\'s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll, and as a Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipient. His pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.\\n\\nPerkins\\' only notable film performance as an actor was in John Landis\\' 1985 film Into the Night, a cameo-laden film that includes a scene where characters played by Carl and David Bowie die at each other\\'s hand.\\n\\nIn 1986, he returned to the Sun Studios in Memphis, joining Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and Roy Orbison on the album Class of \\'55. The record was a tribute to their early years at Sun and, specifically, the Million Dollar Quartet jam session involving Perkins, Presley, Cash, and Lewis on December 4, 1956.\\n\\nIn 1989, he co-wrote and played guitar on The Judd\\'s #1 country hit, \"Let Me Tell You About Love\".\\n\\n\\nLater years:\\n\\nIn 1989 Perkins signed a record deal for an album with the title Friends, Family, and Legends, featuring performances by Chet Atkins, Travis Tritt, Steve Wariner, Joan Jett, Charlie Daniels, along with Paul Shaffer and Will Lee. In 1992 Perkins developed throat cancer during the production of this CD. Perkins returned to Sun Studio in Memphis to record with Scotty Moore, Presley\\'s first guitar player. The CD was called 706 ReUNION, released on Belle Meade Records, and featured D.J. Fontana, Marcus Van Storey and The Jordanaires. In 1993, Perkins appeared with the Kentucky Headhunters in a music video remake, shot in Glasgow, Kentucky, of his song Dixie Fried. Perkins\\' last album, Go Cat Go!, was released in 1996, and featured new collaborations with many of the above artists, as well as George Harrison, Paul Simon, John Fogerty, Tom Petty, and Bono. It was released by the independent label Dinosaur Records, and distributed by BMG.\\n\\nHis last major concert appearance was the \"Music for Montserrat\" all-star charity concert at Royal Albert Hall on September 15, 1997.\\n\\n\\nDeath and legacy:\\n\\nFour months later at Jackson-Madison County Hospital, Jackson, Tennessee, Carl Perkins died at the age of 65 from throat cancer after suffering several strokes. Among those in attendance at the funeral at Lambuth University in 1998 were ex-Beatle George Harrison, Jerry Lee Lewis, Wynonna Judd, Garth Brooks, Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. He is interred at Ridgecrest Cemetery in Jackson, Tennessee.\\n\\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him #69 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\\n\\nCarl Perkins\\' wife, Valda deVere Perkins, died November 15, 2005 in Jackson, Tennessee.\\n\\nDrive-By Truckers, on their album The Dirty South, recorded a song \"Carl Perkins\\' Cadillac\" that gives a poignant history of the artist and his relationships.\\n\\nPerkins is the subject of an acclaimed biography, Go, Cat, Go, by noted New York-based music writer David McGee.\\n\\nPlans for a biographical film about Perkins have been announced by Santa Monica-based production company Fastlane Entertainment. \\n\\nCarl Perkins (pianist)\\n\\nCarl Perkins (born August 16, 1928, Indianapolis, Indiana, died March 17, 1958, Los Angeles, California) was an American jazz pianist.\\nPerkins was born in Indianapolis but worked mainly in Los Angeles.

       " 'Carl Dean Wilson (December 21, 1946 – February 6, 1998) was an American singer, songwriter, and musician, best known as one of the founding members of The Beach Boys, alongside his brothers Brian and Dennis. As well as being an influential guitarist, Carl is regarded as having one of the finest singing voices in the rock idiom, notably performing lead vocals on The Beach Boys\\' #1 hit \"Good Vibrations\", also regarded as one of the greatest pop singles ever produced.\\n\\nBorn in Hawthorne, California to Murry and Audree Wilson, Carl Wilson was the youngest of the Wilsons\\' three sons. A contrast to the ambitious and melancholy Brian and the rebellious Dennis, Carl was a quiet, well-mannered young man who rarely if ever felt the brunt of the parental abuse often perpetrated by father Murry. As a teenager, Carl became enamored with the growing rock and roll scene, particularly Chuck Berry, whom he sought to emulate when learning to play the guitar. Carl\\'s love of rock and roll is partly credited with shaping the early sound of The Beach Boys, and as a result, surf rock as a whole.\\n\\nWhen The Beach Boys were formed, Carl became lead guitarist; his Berry-inspired lead guitar lines are a staple of many of their early, primarily surf rock-driven hit singles, among them their very first, \"Surfin\\'\" (1961). During the first three years of the band\\'s existence, Carl rarely sang lead vocals. Notably, when Brian\\'s production methods started to shift more towards session musicians, Carl remained one of the few group members to still contribute instrumental tracks, recording guitar leads during vocal sessions with his guitar plugged directly into the soundboard.\\n\\nAs the \\'60s progressed, Carl became a more confident singer and performer; following his much-vaunted lead vocal for \"God Only Knows\", featured on the seminal Pet Sounds (1966), more and more often he found himself in the role of a featured lead vocalist, a role previously dominated by Brian and bandmate Mike Love. Following the worldwide success of \"Good Vibrations\", throughout the \\'60s Carl would continue to lend his voice to (admittedly more modest) hit singles such as \"Darlin\\'\", \"I Can Hear Music\", and \"Wild Honey\".\\n\\nAfter brother Brian\\'s retirement as an onstage performer in 1965, Carl assumed the role of de facto onstage bandleader (contracts from this time stipulating that promoters would be hiring \"Carl Wilson plus four other musicians\"), eventually taking charge of studio sessions as well in response to Brian\\'s continually decreasing role within the group. In the late \\'60s, Carl also made headlines as a conscientious objector to the ongoing Vietnam War; at one point, the Beach Boys were forced to go on tour without Carl due to his having to appear before the draft board.\\n\\nThough never a prolific songwriter,  the dawn of the \\'70s saw the genesis of Carl\\'s first self-composed songs; previously released songs credited to Carl had been either surf rock instrumentals, or songs on which he was credited for arrangement ideas rather than songwriting. Together with then-manager Jack Rieley, Carl wrote two songs for The Beach Boys\\' 1971 album Surf\\'s Up; namely, \"Feel Flows\" and \"Long Promised Road\", the latter of which he viewed as his \"first real song.\" Subsequent Beach Boys albums would typically feature a couple of Carl Wilson originals, usually co-written with a bandmember or other writer.. Another notable song composed with Rieley was \"The Trader\", an anti-imperialist opus that opened side two of the Beach Boys\\' 1972 album Holland. This particular album was meant to be Brian\\'s glorious return to the producer\\'s chair, but a lack of interest on his part resulted in Carl having to take the brunt of the responsibility.\\n\\nThroughout the \\'70s, Carl also served as producer for a number of other artists such as Ricci Martin (son of Dean Martin; Carl would later marry Dean\\'s daughter Gina), and South African group The Flame, of which members Blondie Chaplin Rikki Fataar would serve as members of The Beach Boys for a couple of years. The lineup including Chaplin and Fataar would release the album Carl and the Passions - \"So Tough\" (1972), its title a reference both to a long-forgotten name once used for the group that would become The Beach Boys, as well as a nod at Carl\\'s long-running de facto leadership.\\n\\nBy the early 1980s, The Beach Boys had split into several camps, the two most basic of which were \"nostalgia\" and \"progress\"; Carl was of the latter group. Frustrated with the band\\'s continuing reliance on decade-old hits and half-hearted emulation of their \\'60s aesthetics, Carl took a leave of absence in 1981. During the years that followed, he would release two solo albums--Carl Wilson (1981) and Youngblood (1983)--which received favorable reviews but disappointing sales, not at all helped by a lack of record label support and promotion.\\n\\nBy the time Youngblood was released, however, Carl had already rejoined his old group. That same year, brother Dennis drowned in an unfortunate accident, and was given the unique honor of receiving a burial at sea, an honor usually reserved for war heroes. Though Carl would relegate songwriting and production duties to other bandmates and parties, he continued to produce his own recordings throughout the years. Notably, he performed co-lead vocals on The Beach Boys\\' last #1 hit, \"Kokomo\".\\n\\nA habitual smoker since age 13, Carl was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1997; he would continue performing live with The Beach Boys until a few months before his death. Though his illness had stricken him to the point where he had trouble standing up, when performing \"God Only Knows\", he always respectfully stood for the duration of the song. Carl Wilson died in February 1998, only three months after the death of his mother, Audree Wilson. He was survived by his brother Brian, wife Gina Martin Wilson, and two sons by his first marriage, Justyn and Jonah. His gravestone is inscribed with the words \"The heart and voice of an angel.\"\\n\\nPosthumously, Carl has been featured on a number of recordings, most notably with supergroup Beckley-Lamm-Wilson (consisting of Gerry Beckley of America and Robert Lamm of Chicago, alongside Carl), on some of brother Brian\\'s (whose 1998 song \"Lay Down Burden\" was dedicated to his late brother) solo recordings, and the continuing slew of archival releases by The Beach Boys. Though his Beach Boys vocal spots are usually given to other group members now, performances of \"God Only Knows\" have often made use of Carl\\'s original, irreplaceable vocal tracks. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Carl+Wilson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Carlos Gardel (born Charles Romuald Gardes; 11 December 1890 – 24 June 1935) was an Argentine tango singer, songwriter, composer and actor, and is perhaps the most prominent figure in the history of tango. Gardel died in an airplane crash at the height of his career, becoming an archetypal tragic hero mourned throughout Latin America. For many, Gardel embodies the soul of the tango style. He is commonly referred to as \"Carlitos\", \"El Zorzal\" (The Song Thrush), \"The King of Tango\", \"El Mago\" (The Magician), \"El Morocho del Abasto\" (The Brunet Boy from Abasto), and \"El Mudo\" (The Mute).\\nGardel possessed a baritone voice deployed with unerring musicality and dramatic phrasing, creating miniature masterpieces among the hundreds of three-minute tangos which he recorded during his lifetime. Together with his long-term collaborator, lyricist Alfredo Le Pera, Gardel also wrote several classic tangos, notably \\'Mi Buenos Aires querido\\', \\'Amores de Estudiante\\', \\'Soledad\\', \\'Volver\\', \\'Por una cabeza\\' and \\'El día que me quieras\\'.\\n\\nGardel was born to unmarried 25-year-old laundress Berthe Gardes, the baby registered under the name Charles Romuald Gardes in Toulouse, France, on 11 December 1890. The father of the baby boy was listed on his birth certificate as \"unknown\"; eleven days later Berthe Gardes signed a statement establishing the baby\\'s father as Paul Laserre, a married man who left Toulouse a few months before the baby was born. Berthe Gardes left Toulouse a few years later, likely to escape the social stigma of having a child born out of wedlock. In early 1893 in Bordeaux, France, mother and son boarded the ship SS Don Pedro and sailed to Buenos Aires, arriving on 11 March 1893. Berthe Gardes had her passport recorded; she told immigration authorities that she was a widow. The two-year-old boy was recorded as Charles Gardes.\\nGardel grew up going by Carlos, the Spanish version of his French name, and often by the familiar diminutive form Carlitos. He lived in the Abasto neighborhood of Buenos Aires. He attended Pio IX Industrial high-school located in the Almagro neighborhood of Buenos Aires. His mother worked pressing clothes in the French style.\\n\\nGardel began his career singing in bars and at private parties, and in 1911 formed a duet with Francisco Martino, and after with José Razzano (which would last until 1925), singing a wide repertory. Gardel made the music his own by inventing the tango-canción in 1917 with \\'Mi Noche Triste\\', a theme by Pascual Contursi and Samuel Castriota, which sold 100,000 copies and was a hit throughout Latin America. Gardel went on to tour Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Brazil, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Colombia and made appearances in Barcelona, Madrid, Paris and New York. He sold 70,000 records in the first three months of a 1928 visit to Paris. As his popularity grew, he made a number of films for the Paramount in France and the USA, which were essentially vehicles for his singing and matinée-idol looks.\\n\\n\\nWhen Gardel and his collaborator Le Pera were killed in an airplane crash in Medellín, Colombia in 1935, millions of his fans throughout Latin America went into mourning. Hordes of people thronged to pay their respects as the singer\\'s body travelled via Colombia, New York and Rio de Janeiro to its final resting place in La Chacarita cemetery in Buenos Aires.\\n\\nGardel is still revered from Buenos Aires to Tokyo, where people like to say that \"he sings better every day.\" His fans still like to place a lit cigarette in the fingers of the life-sized statue which adorns his tomb. One of Gardel\\'s favourite phrases, \\'Veinte años no es nada\\' (Twenty years is nothing) became a famous saying across Latin America. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Carlos+Gardel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In 1982, the artist got a role in the Colombian TV series Tiempo Sin Huella, starting his successful acting career, later extending his professional skills to the Puerto Rican television.\\n\\nAfter participating in some teen programs as a singer/actor, he got the main role in the telenovela (soap opera) \"Gallito Ramírez,\" which made him a famous actor. Later, another telenovela, \"Escalona\" made him return to his \"costeño\" roots (he was born in Santa Marta, the same town of the famous soccer player \"El Pibe\" Valderrama, located in the north coast of Colombia) and mainly to sing classic vallenato songs of one of the most prestigious vallenato composers, Rafael Escalona.

Douglas comes from a musical family background, her mother being blues and jazz singer Minnie Newsome and her cousin, soul legend, Sam Cooke.\\n\\nAfter a few years as an actress Douglas decided to concentrate on her music career and in the early 1970s she landed the role of lead singer for the reformed soul group The Chantels. She toured the U.S. with the group for a while before receiving a record contract with Midland International Records in 1974 as a solo act. The first single released under the label, \"Doctor\\'s Orders\", became a hit, reaching #2 on Billboard magazine\\'s Disco chart, #9 R&B and #11 on the Billboard Hot 100. The follow up single \"A Hurricane Is Coming Tonite\" became a minor hit, reaching #81 on Billboard\\'s Hot 100. In 1976 she hit #1 on the disco chart with \"Midnight Love Affair\" / \"Crime Don\\'t Pay\", both from her second album Midnight Love Affair. The single also reached the #96 spot on Cash Box magazine\\'s top 100 chart. The following year she recorded the track \"You Make Me Feel the Music\" for the soundtrack to the 1977 motion picture The Haunted.\\n\\n\"So You Win Again\" was arranged by Michael Zager whose presence on Douglas\\' 1978 album release Burnin\\' resulted in a critical (if not commercial) upswing. Burnin\\' also featured Douglas\\' version of the Bee Gees\\' \"Night Fever\" - not a Zager arrangement - which became Douglas\\' only entry in the UK Singles Chart at #66.\\n\\nDouglas\\' 1979 album Come Into My Life was an obvious bid to re-charge her club popularity: only six tracks long with production by Greg Carmichael who had enjoyed several disco hits with studio groups, but the single \"I Got The Answer\" was only a mild club success. Although she did not appear in the disco themed movie Saturday Night Fever, Douglas was enough of a disco star that her name appears on the marquee of the disco featured in the movie. Even though Douglas would go on to chart over a half-dozen other hits on the U.S. disco chart, none of them would reach the success on the mainstream pop charts like \"Doctor\\'s Orders\".In 1981, Douglas\\' cover of the Three Degrees\\' \"My Simple Heart\" was released on 20th Century Records as by then the Midland International (aka Midsong) was defunct. \"My Simple Heart\" was also Douglas\\' debut on Carrere Records based in Paris where Douglas lived for a time: in the early 1980s Carrère handled Douglas\\' European releases while in the US Douglas was signed to O\\'Loughlin\\'s Next Plateau label.  Her last album to date \\'I Got Your Body\\', renamed \\'Love Zone\\' in the US and Canada, was released in 1983 including her latest four 12\" singles from 1981 to 1983: \"My Simple Heart\", \"You\\'re Not So Hot\", \"I Got Your Body\" and \"Got Ya Where I Want Ya\". The cut \"You\\'re Not So Hot\" reached #71 in France (1982).\\n\\nThe retro-boom of the 1990s put Douglas back on the road touring and making personal appearances at a number of special events including the Martin Luther King Concert Series, Beatstock \\'97, Saturday Night Fever 20th Anniversary Reunion and the Dance Music Hall of Fame ceremony. In 2003, she returned to the recording studio when she was invited to sing backing vocals on Wanda Dee\\'s Goddess Is Here! CD. During this period, she also re-recorded a number of her hits, which were also released. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Carol+Douglas\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Carrie is (\"Behind The Mask\"-1984). was married to Producer Dick Griffey had already had success with The Whispers when Carrie was asked to sing backgrounds on one of their albums for Don Cornelius\\' Soul Train label. Griffey was impressed by her natural singing style and her tall statuesque beauty. \\n     He secured her an album deal with Soul Train Records and work began on her first release. The Whispers returned the favor and appeared on background vocals, baby brother of course provided keyboards and co-wrote two songs. Lucas wrote four additional tunes. \\n \\n    \"Simply Carrie\" was released in 1977. The one and only 12\" single pulled from the album cemented her name in disco history. From it\\'s release, \"I Gotta Keep Dancing\" was an instant hit, racing to number one on the club charts. The song was penned by her cousin Malcolm Anthony, and cousins Merlin and Wayne Bell also wrote three songs for the album. The album was rounded out with ballads and R&B numbers aimed at making Carrie a MOR artist. The album was a real family affair.\\n     By now Griffey and Lucas had become an \"item\" and both suffered from negative talk in the L.A. music scene. Undeterred they began work on her sophmore release, 1978\\'s  \"Street Corner Symphony.\" The album had Greg on keyboards/arrangements, and even Griffey added his vocal lead on a track, The Whispers added backgrounds and served as co-producers as well. Once again a single 12\" was released of the title track, a hommage to 1960\\'s doo wop groups. This album was released on Griffey\\'s own label the newly formed Solar Records (Sound Of Los Angeles Records). \\n \\n    Carrie had set a formula and true to it, she released one album and one 12\" single in 1979. By now Griffey\\'s stable of artists included Lakeside, The Whispers, Carrie Lucas, Shalamar, and Dynasty. He was enjoying considerable success with all of them and like the producers of the sixties he would cross-collaborate them. For her album \"Carrie Lucas In Danceland\" Griffey brought in Jody Watley (Shalamar) for backgrounds, Lakeside (co-producers and backgrounds) and Walter and Wallace Scott (Whispers) for backgrounds. Famed organist Kossi Gardner wrote (and played on) the hit \"Dance With You\" which propelled the album to the top of the dance charts. By the beginning of the new decade, with the outstanding success of \"Dance With You,\" Carrie was poised for her most successful release yet. \\n    1980\\'s \"Portrait Of Carrie\" was her finest album and most popular, producing three smash hits. The first 12\" was an updated reworking of her first hit, this time around entitled simply \"Keep Smilin\\'.\" Followed by the cutesy \"It\\'s Not What You Got (It\\'s How You Use It)\" and then the pro-feminist anthem \"Career Girl.\" This time around Dick shared production duties with Leon Sylvers and Kossi Gardner. Backgrounds were once again courtesy of The Whispers. \\n     Carrie was slowly moving out of the music business and her next release wasn\\'t until 1982. \"Still In Love\" recorded and released under the banner of Solar Records was now distributed by Elektra/Asylum. The album produced two 12\" singles, \"Men\" and the more successful \"Show Me Where You\\'re Coming From.\" As usual Carrie surrounded herself with friends and family for the undertaking. Leon Sylvers co-produced and Walter and Wallace Scott were their co-producing and singing. As a sidenote the future Sheila E. co-wrote the title track. \\n \\n    Her last full length album was released in 1985. By now Griffey had started a new label under the distribution of MCA Records. The Constellation Records release \"Horsin\\' Around\" was her most ambitious ever. It spawned four 12\" singles \"Charlie,\" \"Horsin\\' Around,\" \"Summer In The Street\" and \"Hello Stranger.\" Her remake of the Barbara Lewis classic, \"Hello Stranger\" reached number 20 on the R&B charts and like Lewis, who had used The Dells, Carrie used The Whispers to create that smooth sound. \\n    Carrie\\'s last know recording was an appearance on the 1990 soundtrack to \"Lambada: Set The Night On Fire.\" She performs the song \"I Like The Rhythm.\" Carrie, now married to Dick Griffey has instead decided to retire from the music business and concentrate on married life and her beloved horses. Unidisc Records in Canada has released a \"Greatest Hits\" package that contains most of her 12\" mixes in 1999.

Case Woodard was born in New York City and was signed to Def Soul records. He first started working in the R&B industry as a backup singer, working with big name R&B artists like Usher. In 1996, Case released his self-titled debut album. The album featured \"Touch Me Tease Me\" with rapper Foxy Brown and R&B singer Mary J. Blige, the hit single from \"The Nutty Professor\".

Her grandmother like to take Casey and her sister out to the local night spots to perform at local karaoke events and the reaction of the crowd and the discovery of her innate vocal talent sparked a passion to write songs and perform.\\n\\nThere weren’t a lot of instruments around her house full of athletes so when Casey was in the 8th grade she asked if she could borrow an acoustic guitar from the music department at the school where her mom worked as a teacher.  Casey began by teaching herself how to play it and almost immediately began writing her own songs and performing them for family and friends.  After she had practically worn out the loaner guitar, Casey’s parents had to admit that this was no passing fancy and agreed to help pay for guitar lessons. Casey’s parents could not deny the determination and passion she had for writing and playing music.\\n\\nSix months later, Casey’s parents thought it was time to return the borrowed guitar and buy her one of her own.  The only condition they set in return for buying her that first guitar was that she write a song for her parent’s 20th wedding anniversary six months later. That condition helped shape Casey’s preference to write about real life experiences and situations.\\n\\nOver the ensuing years since Casey began writing, playing and singing, she has performed at many singer-songwriter events both in her home town and more recently in Nashville.  Casey has added to her schedule by playing more routinely at a variety of venues throughout Southwest Florida where she likes to share a variety of covers and her original songs.   More recently, Casey has been performing at large music festivals throughout Florida. Some of these performances have led to opportunities to open up for some top  40 acts like James Otto, Craig Morgan and Justin Moore.\\n\\nCasey travels to Nashville to perform and work with other talent in the music industry as often as possible.  She is a member of  the Nashville Songwriters Association International.  During these trips to Nashville she has been able to play alongside other aspiring and accomplished singer-songwriters at legendary music venues such as the Commodore Lounge, the Bluebird Café, and the 2009 Rising Star Contest at Puckett’s Grocery in Franklin, Tennessee. While playing her music in Nashville Casey has met many other wonderful musicians who were kind, supportive and helpful, giving advice and sharing their personal stories with her.\\n\\nCasey has been having the time of her life pursuing her musical journey.  She loves performing live…sharing her songs and seeing the way her lyrics and vocal styling’s touch people.  She has recently begun learning to play the piano which she feels will help her with composing as well as add another dimension to her performances.\\n\\nCasey hopes that the national spotlight provided by Casey’s performances on NBC’s The Voice will open other opportunities to continue to pursue her dream to share her music on the stage of incredible venues like The Fillmore, The Troubador The Grand Ole Opry and other legendary venues around the world. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Casey+Weston\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Johnny Cash (born J.R. Cash; February 26, 1932 – September 12, 2003) was an American singer, guitarist, actor, songwriter, author. He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide. Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel.\\n\\nCash was known for his deep, calm bass-baritone voice, the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band characterized by train-sound guitar rhythms, a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor, free prison concerts, and a trademark, all-black stage wardrobe, which earned him the nickname \"The Man in Black.\" He traditionally began his concerts by simply introducing himself, \"Hello, I\\'m Johnny Cash,\" followed by his signature song \"Folsom Prison Blues\".\\n\\nMuch of Cash\\'s music contained themes of sorrow, moral tribulation, and redemption, especially in the later stages of his career. His other signature songs include \"I Walk the Line\", \"Ring of Fire\", \"Get Rhythm\", and \"Man in Black\". He also recorded humorous numbers like \"One Piece at a Time\" and \"A Boy Named Sue\"; a duet with his future wife, June Carter, called \"Jackson\" (followed by many further duets after their wedding); and railroad songs including \"Hey, Porter\", \"Orange Blossom Special\", and \"Rock Island Line\". During the last stage of his career, Cash covered songs by several late 20th-century rock artists, notably \"Hurt\" by Nine Inch Nails and \"Rusty Cage\" by Soundgarden.\\n\\nJohnny Cash was born on February 26, 1932, in Kingsland, Arkansas, to Ray Cash and Carrie Cloveree (née Rivers). He was the fourth of seven children, who were in birth order: Roy, Margaret Louise, Jack, J. R., Reba, Joanne, and Tommy (who also became a successful country artist). He was primarily of English and Scottish descent. As an adult he traced his surname to 11th-century Fife, after meeting with the then-laird of Falkland, Major Michael Crichton-Stuart. Cash Loch and other locations in Fife bear the name of his family.\\n\\nAt birth, Cash was named J. R. Cash. When Cash enlisted in the United States Air Force, he was not permitted to use initials as a first name, so he changed his name to John R. Cash. In 1955, when signing with Sun Records, he started going by Johnny Cash.\\n\\nIn March 1935, when Cash was three years old, the family settled in Dyess, Arkansas, a New Deal colony established to give poor families a chance to work land that they had a chance to own as a result. Cash started working in cotton fields at the age of five, singing along with his family while working. The Cash farm experienced a flood during the family\\'s time in Dyess, which led Cash later to write the song \"Five Feet High and Rising\". His family\\'s economic and personal struggles during the Great Depression inspired many of his songs, especially those about other people facing similar difficulties. Consequently, Cash had sympathy for the poor and working class throughout his life.\\n\\nCash was very close to his older brother, Jack. On Saturday May 12, 1944, Jack was pulled into an unguarded table saw at his high school while cutting oak into fence posts as his job and was almost cut in two. He lingered until the following Saturday, when he died. Cash often spoke of the horrible guilt he felt over this incident; according to Cash: The Autobiography, his father was away that morning, but Johnny, his mother, and even Jack himself, all had premonitions or a sense of foreboding about that day. His mother urged Jack to skip work and go fishing with his brother, but Jack insisted on working since the family needed the money at the time. On his deathbed, Jack said he had visions of Heaven and angels. Decades later, Cash spoke of looking forward to meeting his brother in Heaven.\\n\\nCash\\'s early memories were dominated by gospel music and radio. Taught guitar by his mother and a childhood friend, Cash began playing and writing songs at the age of 12. When young, Cash had a high-tenor voice, before becoming a bass-baritone after his voice changed.\\n\\nIn high school, he sang on a local radio station. Decades later, he released an album of traditional gospel songs, called My Mother\\'s Hymn Book. He was also significantly influenced by traditional Irish music, which he heard performed weekly by Dennis Day on the Jack Benny radio program.\\n\\nIn 1997, Cash was diagnosed with the neurodegenerative disease Shy–Drager syndrome, a form of multiple system atrophy. According to biographer Robert Hilburn, the disease was originally misdiagnosed as Parkinson\\'s disease, and Cash even announced to his audience that he had Parkinson\\'s after nearly collapsing on stage in Flint, Michigan, on October 25, 1997. Soon afterwards, his diagnosis was changed to Shy–Drager, and Cash was told he had about 18 months to live. The diagnosis was later again altered to autonomic neuropathy associated with diabetes. The illness forced Cash to curtail his touring. He was hospitalized in 1998 with severe pneumonia, which damaged his lungs.\\n\\nDuring the last stage of his career, Cash released the albums American III: Solitary Man (2000) and American IV: The Man Comes Around (2002). American IV included cover songs by several late 20th-century rock artists, notably \"Hurt\" by Nine Inch Nails and \"Personal Jesus\" by Depeche Mode. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails commented that he was initially skeptical about Cash\\'s plan to cover \"Hurt\", but was later impressed and moved by the rendition. The video for \"Hurt\" received critical and popular acclaim, including a Grammy Award.\\n\\nJune Carter Cash died on May 15, 2003, at the age of 73. June had told Cash to keep working, so he continued to record, completing 60 more songs in the last four months of his life, and even performed a few surprise shows at the Carter Family Fold outside Bristol, Virginia. At the July 5, 2003, concert (his last public performance), before singing \"Ring of Fire\", Cash read a statement about his late wife that he had written shortly before taking the stage:\\n\\n\"The spirit of June Carter overshadows me tonight with the love she had for me and the love I have for her. We connect somewhere between here and Heaven. She came down for a short visit, I guess, from Heaven to visit with me tonight to give me courage and inspiration like she always has. She\\'s never been one for me except courage and inspiration. I thank God for June Carter. I love her with all my heart. \"\\n\\nCash continued to record until shortly before his death. His final recordings were made on August 21, 2003, and consisted of \"Like the 309\", which appeared on American V: A Hundred Highways in 2006, and the final song he completed, \"Engine 143\", which was recorded for his son John Carter Cash for a planned Carter Family tribute album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Cat Power is American singer, songwriter, musician, occasional actress, and model Charlyn Marie Marshall (also known as Chan, pronounced \"Shawn\") (born in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. on 21 January 1972). Cat Power was originally the name of Marshall\\'s first band, but has become her stage name as a solo artist.\\n\\nAfter dropping out of high school, Marshall started performing under the name Cat Power, while in Atlanta, backed by musicians Glen Thrasher, Mark Moore, and others. She soon moved to New York City, New York, United States in 1992, then later opening for Liz Phair in 1994, she met Steve Shelley of Sonic Youth and Tim Foljahn of Two Dollar Guitar, who encouraged her to record, and played on her first two albums, 1995\\'s Dear Sir and 1996\\'s Myra Lee. In 1996 she was signed to Matador Records, and released her third album, What Would the Community Think, which spawned a single and music video, \"Nude as the News\".\\n\\nShortly following the release of What Would the Community Think Marshall disappeared from the musical scene, initially working as a baby sitter in Portland, Oregon and then moving to a farmhouse in Prosperity, South Carolina with boyfriend Bill Callahan (who performs under the name Smog). The plan was to permanently retire from music but during a sleepless night resulting from a nightmare, Marshall wrote several new songs. These songs would make up the bulk of Moon Pix. The album was recorded at Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne in eleven days with backing musicians Mick Turner and Jim White of the Dirty Three. The album was well-received by critics, and gained her recognition in the indie rock scene. However, during the subsequent tours she grew tired of her own material. This resulted in a series of shows during 1999 involving Marshall providing musical accompaniment to a series of screenings of the silent movie The Passion of Joan of Arc. The shows combined original material and many covers, many of which would later see release on The Covers Record, a collection of cover songs recorded at various sessions in 1998 and 1999. A selection of covers that didn\\'t make it on to the album were recorded at Peel Acres, home of the highly influential and legendary British DJ John Peel. The session was broadcast on his BBC Radio 1 show and featured Marshall\\'s own interpretations of Bob Dylan\\'s \"Hard Times in New York Town\" amongst others.\\n\\nIn 2003 she resumed releasing original material with You Are Free, a diverse and critically acclaimed album that featured guest musicians such as Eddie Vedder, Dave Grohl, and the Dirty Three\\'s Warren Ellis.\\n\\n2004 saw the release of Speaking for Trees, a critically polarizing DVD which featured a single two-hour static shot of Marshall performing in a woodland. It was accompanied by an audio CD containing the 18-minute song \"Willie Deadwilder\", which featured M. Ward on guitar. 2005 found Cat Power out on the road again, touring the world and playing sold-out solo shows, including an Australian tour supporting Nick Cave. The shows largely consisted of material for her next album.\\n\\nCat Power\\'s seventh record, The Greatest, was released in January, 2006. This was not a \"Greatest Hits\" record but rather a collaboration with Al Green\\'s guitarist Teenie Hodges and many other well-known R&B musicians. A tour followed in the fall of 2006.\\n\\nEarly in 2006, Marshall announced the cancellation of her upcoming United States tour, citing \"health-related issues\". A few days later, Matador announced the cancellation of her two shows in London and Paris. She resumed touring in April 2006, playing some of the most well received shows of her career both with the Memphis Rhythm Band and as a solo performer. \\n\\nIn 2007, she played live music for the spring/ summer Chanel Haute Couture collection in Paris and appeared in Wong Kar Wai\\'s film My Blueberry Nights as Katya. Also in 2007, she became the first female ever to win the Shortlist Music Prize when The Greatest was voted album of the year in June. Earlier in the year she was nominated in the Best International Female category at the annual Brit Awards, alongside more mainstream artists like Christina Aguilera and Nelly Furtado. \\n\\nOn January 22, 2008, Cat Power released a second collection of covers called Jukebox--her eighth LP overall. It included versions of songs by artists such as Hank Williams, James Brown, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Patsy Cline and Janis Joplin.\\n\\nSince then, she has released an EP called \"The Dark End of the Street\" on vinyl, only.\\n\\nCat Power released her first original song since 2008 just before Christmas 2011 when an MP3 of \"King Rides By\" was made available on her official site, in exchange for a donation of at least $0.99 to the Festival of Children Foundation and the Ali Forney Center charities. (King Rides By Songfacts). \\n\\nIn 2012, Cat Power released her 9th studio album,  Sun  which received generally positive reviews from critics. The album was included in several year-end lists by music critics and publications. Rolling Stone magazine, in their list of the \"50 Best Albums of 2012\", ranked it at sixteenth place, writing \"the idea of the brilliantly morose Chan Marshall making a dance-rock record is almost absurd. Yet the groove-powered Sun is a perfect fit.\" The A.V. Club placed the album at number twenty-two on their list of the \"Best Albums of 2012.\" Billboard also placed the album at number nine in their list of the \"10 Best Albums of 2012.\"The L.A. Times and Filter magazine both placed the album at number six in their lists of the best albums of 2012. Sun was also included on two separate \"Best Music of 2012\" lists compiled by NPR, appearing at number five on the list compiled by Bob Boilen,while topping the list compiled by Robin Hilton. The album was also listed twenty-eighth on Stereogum\\'s list of top 50 albums of 2012. Thus, becoming Cat Power\\'s most successful original album. \\n\\nIn April 2015, Marshall announced that she recently had a baby.\\n\\nIn February 2016, Marshall had to cancel her New Zealand shows due to health reasons. According to an official press release, this is the first time in Marshall\\'s 18-year touring history she has been forced to postpone, but is \"determined to make it back ASAP, and in good health\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cat+Power\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Roy Buchanan\\'s (September 23, 1939 - August 14, 1988) musical career began in Pixley, California. His father was a sharecropper (not a Pentecostal preacher as Buchanan himself had claimed). Buchanan told how his first musical memories were of racially-mixed revival meetings his family would attend. \"Gospel,\" he recalled, \"that\\'s how I first got into black music\". He in fact drew upon many disparate influences while learning to play his instrument (although he later claimed his aptitude was derived from being \"half-wolf\"). He initially showed talent on the steel guitar before switching to the standard instrument in the early 50\\'s.\\n\\nIn 1957, Buchanan made his recording debut, playing the solo on Dale Hawkins\\' \"My Babe\" for Chicago\\'s Chess Records. Three years later, Buchanan headed north to Canada, where he took charge of the guitar role in Ronnie Hawkins\\' band (a group later to gain fame as The Band). The group\\'s guitar player, Robbie Robertson, studied guitar under Buchanan, and took over the lead guitar spot when Buchanan left the group.\\n\\nThe early 60\\'s found Buchanan performing numerous gigs as a sideman with multiple rock bands, and cutting a number of sessions as guitarist with musicians such as Freddy Cannon and Merle Kilgore.\\n\\nBuchanan\\'s 1962 recording with drummer Bobby Gregg, \"Potato Peeler\", first introduced the trademark Buchanan pinch harmonics. An effort to cash in on the British Invasion caught Buchanan with The British Walkers. In the mid-\\'60\\'s, Buchanan settled down in the Washington, DC area, playing as a sideman before starting his own groups. One of these groups was called The Snakestretchers, an allusion to Buchanan\\'s disdain for the vagaries of the band experience. The Snakestretchers became a semi-permanent combo for Buchanan starting in this period, with whom he made his first acclaimed recording as a front man, Roy Buchanan & the Snakestretchers. Danny Gatton was another respected Telecaster master who lived in Washington, D.C. at that time. Both musicians gained reputations as under-appreciated guitarists.\\n\\nIn 1971, riding on word-of-mouth reputation that included praise from John Lennon, Eric Clapton, Merle Haggard, and an alleged invitation to join the Rolling Stones, Buchanan gained national notoriety as the result of an hour-long Public broadcasting television documentary. Entitled \"The Best Unknown Guitarist In The World\", the show rejuvenated a contract with Polydor and began a decade of national and international touring. He recorded five albums for Polydor (one went gold) and three for Atlantic Records (one gold), while playing most major rock concert halls and festivals. Finally, Buchanan quit recording in 1981, vowing never to enter a studio again unless he could record his own music his own way.\\n\\nFour years later, Buchanan was coaxed back into the studio by Alligator Records. His first album for Alligator, When a Guitar Plays The Blues, was released in the spring of 1985. It was the first time he was given total artistic freedom in the studio. It was also his first true blues album. Fans quickly responded, and the album entered Billboard\\'s pop charts and remained on the charts for 13 weeks. Music critics, as well as fans, applauded Roy\\'s efforts with favorable reviews.\\n\\nHis second Alligator LP, Dancing on the Edge, was released in the fall of 1986. The album, featuring three songs with special guest, rock\\'n\\'soul vocalist Delbert McClinton, won the College Media Journal Award for Best Blues Album of 1986.\\n\\nHe released the twelfth LP of his career and his third for Alligator, Hot Wires, in 1987. In addition to Donald Kinsey (formerly with Albert King and Bob Marley), keyboardist Stan Szelest, and Larry Exum (bass) and Morris Jennings (drums), this album includes guest vocals by veteran soul singer Johnny Sayles and blues singer Kanika Kress.\\n\\nBuchanan died August 14, 1988 in the Fairfax County, Virginia jail while being held after an arrest for public drunkeness.  His death was ruled a suicide, although that finding has been disputed by friends and family. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Roy+Buchanan\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Cathy Carroll, born December 26th, 1939 as Carolyn Stern, was an American singer and first recorded for the Triodex label in 1961 where members of the Earls and the 4 Evers sang backup. Her single \"Jimmy Love\" reached #11 on the WLS Chicago survey. Next came Warner Brothers where she recorded \"Poor Little Puppet,\" her only Hot 100 entry, which struggled to climb the Hot 100 stopping at No. 91. Her powerful voice was well suited to her revival of Johnny Ray\\'s \"Cry\" and she persevered until the mid 1960s with sides cut for the Philips, Cheer, Musicor and Dot labels. Her music was always pure high school pop and amongst her songs was an answer version to Brian Hyland\\'s \"Ginny Come Lately\" and the original version of \"The Young Ones,\" which topped the charts in the UK for Cliff Richard. His own version was issued on the Big Top label and both were reviewed at the same time. Cathy was portrayed as the \"typical American girl\" and went on a sponsored tour of 100 radio stations. In the 2000s the Cheer label issued a 24 track CD of her complete works. She retired from music in the 1970\\'s to raise her two children, Ron Scott, born in 1968 and Jennifer, born in 1976. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cathy+Carroll\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Cathy Dennis (born March 25, 1969 in Norwich, England) is a dance-oriented pop singer-songwriter, record producer and actress.\\n\\nDennis achieved her first success as a vocalist with Dancin\\' Danny D\\'s dance project D Mob, when their single \"C\\'mon and Get My Love\" reached #15 in the UK Singles Chart and #10 in the Billboard Hot 100 in 1990. Originally, it had only reached #93 (UK). It is regarded as an underground classic in the dance music field, and a second collaboration with D Mob, \"That\\'s The Way Of The World,\" was also a major dance hit. It was followed by Dennis\\' debut album, Move to This.\\n\\nShe subsequently scored three solo Top 20 UK / Top 10 U.S. hits and had considerable success in Japan in the early 1990s with \"Just Another Dream\" (#13 UK, #9 U.S., #14 Australia), \"Touch Me (All Night Long)\" (#5 UK, #2 U.S., #16 Australia), which is probably her most remembered hit to date, and \"Too Many Walls\" (#17 UK, #8 U.S., #57 Australia).\\n\\nSubsequent releases were only minor hits. Her final Top 40 hit in the U.S. was \"You Lied to Me\" in 1992, and her final Top 40 hit in the UK was \"Waterloo Sunset\", which made #11 during 1997. That same year her last solo single \"When Your Dreams Turn To Dust\", peaked in the UK at #43.\\n\\n\"Touch Me (All Night Long)\" stayed at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks, and was kept out of the #1 spot by Hi-Five\\'s \"I Like the Way (The Kissing Game)\" the first week and Mariah Carey\\'s \"I Don\\'t Wanna Cry\" the second week. The song was a cover of a 1985 single by Wish featuring Fonda Rae, which had hit #70 on the U.S. R&B chart that year. \"Touch Me\" did reach #1 on the U.S. Dance chart, and its follow-up, \"Too Many Walls,\" which Dennis co-wrote with Anne Dudley of Art of Noise, was a #1 Adult Contemporary hit. It was around this time Dennis agreed to join MTV Club\\'s first tour, booked for six weeks. She dropped out on the third date, later publicly accussing one of Milli Vanilli\\'s members (the tour\\'s headline act) of sexual harassment.\\n\\nDennis released her second album, Into The Skyline, in December 1992 written with an aim toward the U.S. market. The album featured the singles \"You Lied To Me\", \"Irresistible\", \"Falling\" and \"Why [D Mob with Cathy Dennis]\". The album got to #8 in the UK, whilst in the U.S., \"You Lied to Me\" was a Top 40 hit and \"Irresistible\" made the Adult Contemporary Top Ten; however, the album descended the chart rapidly. Dennis experienced a brief peak of fame, making a cameo in Beverly Hills 90210 singing the song \"Moments of Love\" (a minor U.S. AC chart hit), \"Why\" and \"Touch Me (All Night Long)\". In Japan the album was called Into the Skyline +1, and featured three extra tracks, \"Nothing Moves Me\", a previous b-side, and two tracks that were both released as singles, \"It\\'s My Style\" and \"Love\\'s a Cradle.\"\\n\\nDennis started to record her third album Inspiration. The title track was recorded with Todd Terry, along with another song \"Is There Life After You\", plus other songs as yet unknown. She decided to stop recording this album and only two songs have ever been released, \"Find the Key to Your Life\" with David Morales for the then-popular movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze and \"SOS\", which can be found on the Beverley Hills 90210, The College Years soundtrack.\\n\\nDennis made her first attempt at co-writing a song for Dannii Minogue called \"Love\\'s on Every Corner\".\\n\\nIn 1996 Dennis changed musical track away from the dance-pop sound of previous releases, to a more traditional singer-songwriter approach. The resulting album Am I the Kind of Girl? was more in keeping with the Britpop sound of bands such as Blur and performers such as Stephen Duffy, and featured collaborations with Guy Chambers of The Lemon Trees and Andy Partridge of XTC. However, even though a couple of singles charted in the UK (including a Number 11 cover of Ray Davies\\' \"Waterloo Sunset\"), the album failed to make much inroads into the album charts.\\n\\nDennis\\' last release appeared on the OST Robin Hood Men in Tights singing \"Marian (Duet Version) - Cathy Dennis & Lance Ellington\".\\n\\nIn recent years, her greatest success has come as a songwriter: in 1996 she co-wrote \"Bumper to Bumper\", which was the B-Side to Spice Girls\\' first hit single \"Wannabe\". Five of her compositions have reached number one in Britain. \"Never Had a Dream Come True\" and \"Have You Ever\" (both recorded by S Club 7), \"Anything Is Possible\" (recorded by Will Young), and \"Toxic\" (recorded by Britney Spears) all reached number one, with \"Toxic\" and \"Never Had a Dream Come True\" also hitting the Top 10 in the United States. Her highest-selling composition, \"Can\\'t Get You Out of My Head\" (recorded by Kylie Minogue), spent four weeks at number one in Britain, rekindled interest in Minogue in America, where it hit #7 on the Hot 100, and sold over three million copies worldwide to become the world\\'s second highest selling single in 2001. \"Can\\'t Get You Out of My Head\" also won Dennis an Ivor Novello Award for the year\\'s most performed composition. She also won this award two years later for \"Anything Is Possible\" (Cathy Dennis, Chris Braide).\\n\\nShe co-wrote the Pop Idol theme for the television series, and in Britain and the United States contestants Will Young, Gareth Gates, Kelly Clarkson, and Clay Aiken have recorded her songs as their first singles. Other artists who have recorded her songs include Dannii Minogue, Delta Goodrem, Céline Dion, Spice Girls, Emma Bunton, Ronan Keating, Rachel Stevens, Hear\\'Say, S Club Juniors, P!nk, Janet Jackson, Brooke Hogan, Michelle McManus, Hooverphonic, Jentina, Thalia, Katy Perry, Rosin Murphy, Heidi Montag, David Cook, Le Toya Lucket.\\n\\nShe has recently collaborated with the British singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor, and song-writer Greg Kurstin, on a track called \"Catch You\". Ellis-Bextor\\'s album entitled Trip the Light Fantastic is set to be released in early 2007 through Fascination Records.\\n\\nAccording to news reports, Dennis was working on a new album under the name Sexcassettes which she planned for a 2008 release. The albums\\' first single, \"Killer Love\" was also to be released before the end of 2008. There is currently no news information avaliable about this project. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cathy+Dennis\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Céline Marie Claudette Dion (born March 30, 1968 in Charlemagne, Quebec, Canada) is a Canadian singer. Regarded as one of pop music\\'s most influential voices, Céline Dion remains the best-selling Canadian artist and one of the best-selling artists of all time with record sales of over 200 million copies worldwide.  To date, Céline Dion has won five Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year.  She is the second best-selling female artist in the US during the Nielsen SoundScan era.  In 2003, Dion was honoured by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) for selling over 50 million albums in Europe. In 2004, Dion received the Diamond award at the World Music Awards recognizing her status as one of the best-selling female artist of all time. In 2007 she was honoured with the Legend Award at World Music Awards in recognition of her global success and outstanding contribution to the music industry.  Her signature song, \"My Heart Will Go On,\" served as the love theme for the 1997 blockbuster film Titanic and topped the charts worldwide, as well as winning the Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Original Song.\\n\\nBorn to a large impoverished family, Dion emerged as a teen star in the French-speaking world after her manager and future husband René Angélil mortgaged his home to finance her first record. In 1990, she released the anglophone album Unison, establishing herself as a viable pop artist in North America and other English-speaking areas of the world. \\n\\nDion had first gained international recognition in the 1980s by winning both the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival and the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest.Following a series of French albums in the early 1980s, she signed on to CBS Records Canada in 1986. During the 1990s, with the help of Angélil, she achieved worldwide fame after signing with Epic Records and releasing several English albums along with additional French albums, becoming one of the most successful artists in pop music history. However, in 1999 at the height of her success, Dion announced a temporary retirement from entertainment in order to start a family and spend time with her husband, who had been diagnosed with cancer.She returned to the top of pop music in 2002 and signed a three-year (later extended to almost five years) contract to perform nightly in a five-star theatrical show at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas.\\n\\nAfter performing in 25 countries during the Taking Chances World Tour which ended in February 2009 (one year after it began) she took another 2 year hiatus, focusing on expanding her family. After 6 in-vitro tries she gave birth to twin boys Nelson and Eddy in October 2010. In the meantime she announced her return to Vegas, her new show simply named \"Céline\" premièred on March 15th 2011 to spectacular reviews by media and audience.\\n\\nDion\\'s music has been influenced by genres ranging from rock and R&B to gospel and classical. While her releases have often received mixed critical reception, she is renowned for her technically skilled and powerful vocals. Dion is the best selling Canadian artist of all time; and her album D\\'eux is the best selling francophone album of all time. Dion is regarded as one of pop music\\'s most influential voices. Linda Lister describes Dion as a reigning Queen of Pop for her influence over the record industry during the 1990s. On a cultural level, Dion is credited for introducing francophone music to many non-francophone countries around the globe. Dion is also credited for both revitalizing and revolutionizing the entertainment scene in Las Vegas with the gargantuan successes of her residencies there. She managed to re-popularize the Las Vegas \"residency\" as a desirable way for top artists to essentially tour in place, letting their fans come to them. Over the years, fellow established icons such as Britney Spears, Elton John, Bette Midler, Rod Stewart, Cher and Shania Twain followed suit.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/C%C3%A9line+Dion\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Cerrone (full name: Jean-Marc Cerrone) (born 24 May 1952, Vitry-sur-Seine, near Paris, France) is an iconic and influential French European disco and dance pop drummer, singer, and music producer. Marc Cerrone has sold over thirty million albums. He claims, and it is often credited by others, that he was \"the first\" to put the kick drum (or bass drum) into the foreground of modern eurodance music.  At the age of 12, he started playing drums and listening to Otis Redding\\'s songs. His passion for music scared his father, who tried to distract him from his obsession. By the end of the 60s, he was fascinated by, among others, Jimi Hendrix, Carlos Santana, and Blood, Sweat & Tears.\\n\\nAt the age of 17, he convinced Gilbert Trigano to hire rock bands for his famous holiday clubs: Club Med (Club Mediterranée). Cerrone became the A&R (artist and repertoire) scout for 40 Club Med vacation villages around the world. His first recordings as a part of Kongas were released on Barclay, where he released his first hit, Boom. He is most famous from the Kongas days for \"Anikana-O\", co-written and produced by Alec R. Costandinos. A remix done by the legendary Tom Moulton was done for the US release on Salsoul Records. This mix was also used on international releases as well.\\n\\nBased in Paris, Cerrone recorded, composed and performed his solo debut \"Love In C Minor\", again with Costandinos. Released on his own Malligator imprint, and distributed by Warner Filipacci in France, it immediately shocked audiences with its erotic flavour and controversial cover, which was soon to be a Cerrone trademark. It was later released with a new, tamer cover that took flashes of nude women into the background and replaced them with four arms clenched instead for the American release. Additionally, label censors edited out the infamous bar conversation at the beginning of the 17 minute masterpiece in the U.S., with the girls in conversation cheekily talking about Cerrone\\'s perceived endowment. It also featured a cover of Los Bravos\\' \"Black Is Black\" and \"Midnite Lady\", a dramatic and anthemic, almost soundtrack directed instrumental piece that closed his brilliant debut. Cotillion Records released the album through Warner distribution in the U.S. The album was released un-edited in Canada, using the original master tapes. The album was recorded and mixed at Trident Studios in London, which was to become the mainstay of French disco producers for the year that follows as it was one of the first 48 track recording studios in the world. This was the final collaboration between Cerrone and the Egyptian-born Costandinos, who went on to create such legendary dancefloor hits such as \"I\\'ve Found Love\" by Love & Kisses and the disco opera re-telling the story of \"Romeo and Juliet\".\\n\\nCerrone continued using pieces of photgraphic and audio erotica to push the envelope whn he released his 2nd album, \"Cerrone\\'s Paradise\". \"Paradise\", was recorded with Raymond Donnez, aka \"Don Ray\", as part of his arrangement entourage after parting company with Costandinos. The original French album cover featured a naked model draped over the top of a refrigerator with a jar in front of white powder spilled in front of it. Cotillion released the album once again, with masssive success on the disco charts. The U.S. release featured a photo of Cerrone wearing a Hawaiian shirt.\\n\\nHis third album \"Supernature\", is considered to be his true masterpiece, having sold over eight million albums worldwide. A departure from the lush orchestration with dizzying electronic instrumentation added to the mix, it was co-written by pop-punk chanteuse Lene Lovich and arranged by Alain Wisniak. The song \"Supernature\" has a sci-fi theme: it\\'s about the rebellion of mutant creatures - created by scientists to end starvation among mankind - against the humans. It also featured \"Sweeet Drums\", a three minute and ten second drum breakdown. The original French album cover was again different, having a gatefold opening with nudes in the centre. The music itself was the same, another sterling effort from the Frenchman.\\n\\nSupernature was used as the theme to Thames TV\\'s \"The Kenny Everett Video Show\", which was shown across the UK on the ITV network.\\n\\nFollowing the success of Supernature, Cerrone IV: The Golden Touch, was released to rave reviews and was another U.S. disco chart topper. Driven by \"Je Suis Music\", \"Look For Love\" and the urban slanted \"Rocket In The Pocket\", there was a musical maturity on this album, showing his fusion attributes, and foreshadowing his future releases. Further proof was the elegant electronic Latino flavoured \"Music Of Life\".\\n\\nReleased only in France, he then ventured into movie scoring, supplying the music score for \"Brigade Mondaine\", a French film. Alternate mixes of his hits such as \"Give Me Love\", \"Phonic\" (originally released as a 12\" single on the Crocos label) and the blistering \"Striptease\". The latter was an underground classic, introduced to international audiences through the Disconet subscription service for DJ\\'s. It was a key inclusion on \"Cerrone by Bob Sinclar\", long considered to be the best compilation mix albums ever released.\\n\\nCerrone V marked a radical departure for the artist, where he made a full fledged attempt to become the vocalist. Moving from Cotillion to Atlantic Records in the US, \"Rock Me\" was the first single and while clubs reacted fairly well, it did not reach the heights of his previous releases. It bears a resemblance to \"Hot Stuff\" by Donna Summer sonically. Recorded in Los Angeles with the musicians backing Toto, Cerrone co-wrote \"Call Me Tonight\" with producer extrordinaire Bob Esty and vocalist/lyricist Michelle Aller. With this team, previously on top of the charts having written \"Take Me Home\" for Cher, Cerrone\\'s magic fused Paris with Malibu giving him another classic. Hardcore fans will notice distinct similarities on \"Looking For Love\" and \"Call Me\" and the Kongas album tracks \"The Fun Cry\" and \"Living On Love\" released on the Crocos label. \"Not Too Shabby\" was also a part of both albums.\\n\\nHis 6th album, \"Cerrone VI\", was the first of his albums to not be released in the U.S., and was issued on Malligator and Unidisc in Canada. Unlike his previous albums, this non-rhythmic offering, using new electronic elements like the then-trendy Fairlight CMI computer was more of Cerrone exploring the entire musical landscape. . Lyricist Pamela Forrest, a Liverpool-born, Paris-based lyricist, added her magic to the album. The instrumental, Herb Alpert-inspired \"Rendezvous\" received scattered adult contemporary play in Canada. Cerrone also returned to the erotic album covers, using an existing Cheyco Leydemann photograph of a bare-breasted blonde in a lawnchair, and inserting himself in the photograph.\\n\\nIn a true return to form, \"You Are The One\" was the cornerstone of his 7th record. Delivering his best and most complete album in years, his addition of American vocalist Jocelyn Brown drove cuts like the funky \"Hooked On You\" and blistering rhytmic return of \"Cherry Tree\". An 11 minute version of Cherry Tree remains on the shelf. This album was rumoured to have been recorded twice. First with Stoke-on-Trent, England native Sue Garner, long the voice of Cerrone\\'s biggest successes and then with Brown. The version with Garner on the lead vocals has never been released.\\n\\nAs a bridge between Cerrone\\'s 7th and 8th albums, a 12\" single, \"Tripping On The Moon\" was released prior and was a blockbuster import hit. Sung by Sue Garner, and vocally reminiscent in tone to \"Supernature\", it was never released in North America as a single. It later became a part of \"Cerrone VIII:Back Track\". It was released on John Luongo\\'s Portrait label, distributed by CBS. While the title track was a mild chart hit in the clubs, the album\\'s lone bright spot was a re-recording of \"Supernature\" sung by Montreal-based Nanette Workman. Workman had a 1973 hit with the song \"The Queen\" on Big Tree Records. A short time thereafter, Canadian born Claudja Barry did a cover version of \"Trippin\\'\", released on Personal Records.\\n\\nHis 9th album, \"Your Love Survived\", featured male lead vocals other than his own sung by the late Arthur Simms. Simms had also recorded a solo album with Alec R. Costandinos on his Ibis/Casablanca imprint. Pamela Forrest also rejoined the cast, writing lyrics on the album. Re-recordings of hits such as \"Give Me Love\", \"Look For Love\" and \"Call Me Tonight\" were also featured on this double LP set. Key tracks included: \"Get Your Lovin\\'\" and \"Workout\".\\n\\nAnother return to form was his 10th album, \"Where Are You Now ?\" Sung by American Carole Rowley and released on Malligator in France, Hi-NRG legendary producer and mixer Ian Levine was tabbed to do the mix, prompting a 12\" release on the Record Shack label. \"Club Underworld\" was also released as a single, in both France and the United States on Personal Records with a new mix.\\n\\nPerhaps the most interesting record of Cerrone\\'s never to be on an full length album was his terrific interpretation of \"Standing In The Shadows Of Love\" intertwined with his own composition \"Freak Connection\". Released only in France, it remains an import classic.\\n\\nCerrone\\'s boutique label, Crocos, was the home to a number of independently produced projects, all of which saw results of some kind. \"Africanism\" by Kongas, arranged by Don Ray, was an energetic fusion of tribal drum beats and emotive male vocals framed around a cover version of \"Gimme Some Lovin\\' by Traffic. It was quickly snapped up for North American distribution in a deal between Cerrone and Polydor U.S.\\n\\nDon Ray real name: Raymond Donnez, considered one of the greatest arrangers of the era, created a furor with his near perfect dance pop album, \"Garden Of Love\". Written with Cerrone, the entire album is considered a seminal classic. Hits such as \"Got To Have Lovin\\'\", \"Body & Soul\" and \"Standing In The Rain\" guided the album to #1 Stateside.

       " 'Cesária Évora (1941-2011) was a morna singa from Cape Verde.  She was known as the \"barefoot diva\" because of her propensity to appear on stage in her bare feet in support of the homeless and poor women and children of her country.\\n\\nBorn on the 27th August 1941 in the port town of Mindelo, Cape Verde, on the island of São Vicente.  Long known as the queen of the morna, a soulful genre (related to the Portuguese fado) sung in Creole-Portuguese, she mixed her sentimental folk tunes filled with longing and sadness with the acoustic sounds of guitar, cavaquinho, violin, accordion, and clarinet. Évora\\'s Cape Verdean blues often spoke of the country\\'s history of isolation and slave trade, as well as emigration; almost two-thirds of the million Cape Verdeans alive live abroad.\\n\\nÉvora\\'s voice, a finely-tuned, melancholy instrument with a touch of hoarseness, highlighted her emotional phrasing by accenting a word or phrase. Even audiences who do not understand her language could be held spell-bound by the emotions evident in her performances.\\n\\nIn 2004 she won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary World Music Album.\\n\\nA heavy smoker for decades, Évora was diagnosed with heart problems in 2005. She suffered strokes in 2008 and in September 2011, when she announced she was retiring. She died at the age of seventy in São Vicente, Cape Verde on the 17th December 2011 from respiratory failure and hypertension.

       " 'Contemporary country singer/songwriter Chad Brock was born and raised in Ocala, FL; despite performing in the church choir throughout his youth, his initial love was athletics, and he was a highly touted high-school football player. After joining the school chorus, however, Brock also emerged as a star soloist, and became so enamored of music that he turned down a collegiate athletic scholarship to pursue a career as a performer. Relocating to Nashville to work as a songwriter, he initially struggled to get his foot in the music industry\\'s door, and as a result spent three years touring as a member of the World Championship Wrestling organization. Finally, in 1998, Brock signed with Warner Bros. and issued his self-titled debut later that year. The second single, \"Ordinary Life,\" was a breakout hit, climbing into the country Top Five, and \"Lightning Does the Work\" was also moderately popular. Brock\\'s follow-up was 2000\\'s Yes!, and the title track -- a story song about meeting and romancing his wife -- became his first country chart-topper, nearly making the pop Top 20 as well. 2001\\'s III didn\\'t quite duplicate that success, however.\\n\\nDiscography:\\n1998-Chad Brock\\n2000-Yes!\\n2001-III <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chad+Brock\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Randall Hank Williams (born May 26, 1949), known professionally as Hank Williams Jr. or alternatively as Hank Jr. or Bocephus, is an American singer-songwriter and musician. His musical style is often considered a blend of Southern rock, blues, and country. He is the son of country music singer Hank Williams; the half-brother of Jett Williams; and the father of Hank Williams III, Holly Williams, Hilary Williams, Sam Williams, and the late Katherine Williams-Dunning.\\n\\nWilliams began his career following in his famed father\\'s footsteps, covering his father\\'s songs and imitating his father\\'s style. Williams\\' first television appearance was in a 1964 episode of ABC\\'s The Jimmy Dean Show, in which at age fourteen he sang several songs associated with his father. Later that year, he was a guest star on Shindig!.\\n\\nWilliams\\' style evolved slowly as he struggled to find his own voice and place within country music. This was interrupted by a near-fatal fall off the side of Ajax Peak in Montana on August 8, 1975. After an extended recovery, he challenged the country music establishment with a blend of country, rock, and blues. As a multi-instrumentalist, Williams\\' repertoire of skills includes guitar, bass guitar, upright bass, steel guitar, banjo, dobro, piano, keyboards, saxophone, harmonica, fiddle, and drums.\\n\\nFrom 1989 through October 2011, his song \"All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight\", refashioned as \"All My Rowdy Friends Are Here on Monday Night\", had been used to open broadcasts of Monday Night Football until it was pulled after Williams made controversial comments comparing President Barack Obama to Adolf Hitler. The song returned to open the show in 2017.\\n\\nOn August 12, 2020, Williams was selected to be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.\\n\\nWilliams\\' early career was guided, some say outright dominated, by his mother Audrey Williams, who many claim was the driving force that led his father to musical superstardom during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Audrey, in many ways, wished for young Hank to be nothing more than a \"Hank Williams, Sr. impersonator\", sometimes going as far as to have clothes designed for him that were identical to his father\\'s stage clothes and vocal stylings very similar to those of his father.\\n\\nAlthough Williams\\' recordings earned him numerous country hits throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, he became disillusioned with his role as a \\'Hank Williams clone\\' and severed ties with his mother in order to pursue his own musical direction and tastes. After recording the soundtrack to Your Cheatin\\' Heart, a biography of his father, Williams, Jr. hit the charts with one of his own compositions, \"Standing in the Shadows\". The song signalled a move to rock and roll and other influences as he stepped from the shadow of his father.\\n\\nAlso during this time, Williams had his first two No. 1 songs: \"All For the Love of Sunshine\" (1970, featured on the soundtrack to Kelly\\'s Heroes) and \"Eleven Roses\" (1972).\\n\\nBy the mid-1970s, Williams had finally found the musical direction that would, eventually, make him a superstar. Williams\\' unique blend of traditional country with southern rock and blues earned him a devoted following, although some mainstream country radio stations wouldn\\'t touch his new songs in this blatantly untraditional sound.\\n\\nWhile recording a series of hit songs, Williams began abusing drugs, including alcohol and eventually tried to commit suicide in 1974. Moving to Alabama, Williams began playing music with Southern rock musicians Toy Caldwell, Marshall Tucker Band and Charlie Daniels, and others.\\n\\nHis last major success was \"There\\'s a Tear in My Beer\", a duet with his father created using electronic dubbing techniques. The song itself was written by his father, presumably, sometime between 1950 and 1953 and was recorded with Hank Williams playing just his guitar. The music video for the song combined existing television footage of Hank Williams performing and the dubbing techniques transferred the image of Hank Jr. onto the screen, so it appeared as if he were actually playing with his father. The video was an overwhelming success, both critically and commercially. It was named Video Of The Year by both the Country Music Association and the Academy of Country music. Hank Williams, Jr. would go on to win a Grammy award in 1990 for Best Country Vocal Collaboration.\\n\\nDespite his slumping album sales, Hank Williams Jr. continued to be a popular concert draw during the early 1990s and continued to record, with several of his recordings during this time still managing to achieve gold status, selling 500,000 copies.\\n\\nHe is probably best known today as the performer of the theme song for Monday Night Football, based on \"All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight\". The opening theme became a classic, as much a part of the show as the football itself. In 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994, Williams\\' opening themes for Monday Night Football would earn him four Emmy awards.\\n\\nWilliams opened for Super Bowl XL on February 5, 2006, on ABC and was in the stands as a Pittsburgh Steelers fan.\\n\\nOn April 10, 2006, CMT honored Williams with the Johnny Cash Visionary Award, presenting it to him at the 2006 CMT Music Awards.\\n\\nOn November 11, 2008, Williams was honored as a BMI Icon at the 56th annual BMI Country Awards. The artists and songwriters named BMI Icons have had \"a unique and indelible influence on generations of music makers\".\\n\\nIn 2011, Williams was named one of \"Seven Living Legends\" of his native Shreveport, Louisiana, by Danny Fox (1954–2014) of KWKH radio. Others named were Bob Griffin of KSLA and KTBS-TV and James Burton. Two others cited, Claude King and Frank Page, both died in 2013.\\n\\nIn 2015, Hank Williams Jr. was Inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Hank+Williams+Jr.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Hakeem Seriki (born November 28, 1979 in Houston, Texas) is a Grammy Award nominated rapper, member of The Color Changin\\' Click and founder of Chamillitary Entertainment. Better known as Chamillionaire, he also uses nicknames such as The Mixtape Messiah, King Koopa, Color Changin\\' Lizard, Chamillinator, Chamillitary Mayne, Major Payne and The Truth From Texas. He began rapping in 1998, releasing mixtapes and a collab album with fellow Houston rapper Paul Wall. He released his debut album, The Sound of Revenge, in 2005, and his sophmore release, Ultimate Victory, in 2007. He plans to release his yet untitled third album at the end of 2009 or early 2010.\\n\\nAfter his parents, a Muslim father from Oyo State, Nigeria and a Christian mother from the United States, separated in his early teenage years, Chamillionaire settled into a notoriously dangerous inner-city neighborhood in North Houston called Acres Homes, which he elaborated upon during an interview with Houston\\'s 104.9 KPTY on October 3. Rap and other forms of secular music, which his parents had highly opposed in their household, became very appealing to the young Hakeem Seriki. Inspired by local rap acts such as The Geto Boys, 8 Ball & MJG, and UGK, as well as other national acts such as N.W.A. and Public Enemy, Chamillionaire began to compose his own ponies.\\n\\nAt a young age, Chamillionaire along with fellow rap music artist and childhood friend Paul Wall, had decided to make music their careers. One day while promoting themselves at a Texas event, Paul Wall and Chamillionaire ran into Michael 5000 Watts, a popular mixtape DJ from the Northside. After proposing to do promotions for Watts\\' company, the Swishahouse, Chamillionaire and Paul Wall came to Watts\\' studio and convinced Watts to allow them freestyle on an intro to Watts\\' radio show on Houston’s 97.9 The Box. Watts, who himself was convinced to rap on the record, enjoyed the freestyle so much that he put the verses on one of his mixtapes. The freestyle became so popular in the streets that Chamillionaire and Paul Wall became regular staples on Houston\\'s mixtape circuit, appeared on several of Watts\\' mixtapes, and became permanent members of Swishahouse.\\n\\nAlthough Paul Wall and Chamillionaire were making much noise in the streets by rapping on Watts\\' mixtapes, they, along with several other members of the Swishahouse, became frustrated with the lack of money they were receiving from the mixtapes. After fellow member Slim Thug left the label, Chamillionaire and Paul Wall followed and started their own mixtape group known as The Color Changin\\' Click. Each successive mixtape released by The Color Changin\\' Click led to more business opportunities; the most notable of which being a contract to do a full album for Paid in Full Records. A one album contract was then negotiated between the Color Changin\\' Click and Paid in Full\\'s label head, DJ Madd Hatta from 97.9 The Box, and the CCC\\'s first album, Get Ya Mind Correct, would go on to sell over 100,000 copies.\\n\\nThe sale of all these albums without the backing of a major deal caught the attention of several major labels wanting to sign Chamillionaire and Paul. Chamillionaire and his labelmates decided to remain independent, however, until the right deal came along. While working on his second album with the Color Changin\\' Click, Chamillionaire began to have creative differences with Paul Wall, so much so that it was decided that the two emcees should each release solo albums that would be packaged together. When Chamillionaire became dissatisfied with how things were being resolved, he left Paid in Full and his almost complete album after fulfilling his contractual obligations to focus on promoting his mixtape label Chamillitary instead. As a kid, Chamillionaire was a big fan of MANKind, also known as Big June.\\n\\nChamillionaire\\'s Myspace\\n\\nThis kid from Houston, Texas has some nerve. That\\'s what came to mind as you watched an MTV special in early 2005 showcasing H-Town\\'s commercial and artistic re-emergence on the rap scene. Following his brazen freestyle, the focused and much-heralded MC known as Chamillionaire faced a national audience and launched a swagger-filled proclamation on camera: \"I\\'m the truth from Texas...\" While such boasting may seem par-for-the-course in the prideful 25-year-plus history of hip-hop, the latter ambitious statement aptly describes Chamillionaire. It\\'s the reason why he earned the lofty alias \"The Mixtape Messiah,\" a title Cham was crowned after independently selling over 100,000 copies of the Get Ya Mind Correct album, and by selling thousands of his numerous mix tapes. It\\'s why the former member of Houston\\'s legendary mix-tape power Swisha House garnered coverage in such major hip-hop publications as Source and XXL without the backing of a major deal. When the Houston lyricist set off a major label bidding war to distribute his Chamillitary Records, it became abundantly clear throughout the \\'hood and the music industry Chamillionaire is indeed the truth. \\n\\nWith his major-label debut The Sound Of Revenge set for release on Universal Records, Chamillionaire is poised to take his place among Houston\\'s current hip-hop elite, including the new generation of rhyme-spitters such as Lil\\' Flip, Slim Thug, Mike Jones and Paul Wall, as well respected vets UGK and Scarface. \"You call out a lot of rappers and ask them why they are the best and they are going to tell you everything but the music,\" Cham laughs. \"They will tell you that they are the best because they have some nice rims, a chain, and a mansion.\" He then adds in a straight-no-chaser tone, \"You\\'ve heard all the hype about Chamillionaire; that he\\'s sick with the lyrics, sings hooks, and represents the streets and the clubs. But I just want to come as close as possible to living up to my reputation.\" \\n\\nChamillionaire recruits an impressive list of talent on his debut effort, including Lil\\' Flip, Bun B, Scarface, and Krayzie Bone, as well as in-demand producers Scott Storch (50 Cent), Mannie Fresh (Lil\\' Wayne, Baby, Juvenile) and Cool & Dre (The Game). But, it\\'s his work with Atlanta studio kings The Beat Bullies (1Big Boi/OutKast) that sets the tone for much of The Sound Of Revenge\\'s diverse platform. \"They understand me,\" Cham says of the in-house producers. \"There are a lot of producers that have dope beats, but they don\\'t know me as an artist. [The Beat Bullies] being from Atlanta, can take it to the strip clubs, the streets and to the radio.\"\\n\\nThe name Chamillionaire represents the unique style that defines the talented urban artist, and his ability to change and adapt on the fly, forcing people to respect the true breadth of his talent. And just as this MC moniker exemplifies, Chamillionaire is anything but predictable and most certainly versatile. \"Picture Perfect\" featuring Bun B comes off as a lyrical nod to the classic \\'hood swagger of UGK, while the Beat Bullies\\'-anchored \"Radio Interruption\" showcases Cham\\'s prowess for walking the blurred line between street praise and mass appeal. The storytelling brilliance of \"No Snitching\" (Cool & Dre), finds Cham detailing the unwritten laws of \\'hood politics. On the Scott Storch produced \"Turn It Up,\" Cham tag-teams with freestyle king Lil\\' Flip as they spit over an infectious track that is Houston\\'s answer to a summer club banger. And the soulful \"Here Comes The Rain\" finds Chamillionaire exploring the daily struggles of life with heartfelt lyricism and ghetto angst. \\n\\n\"It\\'s a very personal song and the title says it all,\" Cham says of the revealing track. \"In a person\\'s life the rain symbolizes the struggles we all go through. Whether you are dealing with losing a loved one or your rent is due on the 1st, but it\\'s the 3rd and you don\\'t have it. I\\'m just talking about surviving the tough times.\" \\n\\nChamillionaire has definitely seen his share of struggles on his road to redemption. Born to a Muslim father and Christian mother, secular music was banned in his household. Chamillionaire was barely a teenager when he moved to a low-income neighborhood in the notorious North Side of Houston, following the separation of his parents. By the early \\'90s, however, rap rebels such as NWA, Public Enemy, as well as hometown heroes The Geto Boys, 8-Ball & MJG and UGK would inspire a young Hakeem to write his own rhymes.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n(C) Wikipedia The Free Encyclopedia\\nChamillionaire\\'s Myspace <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chamillionaire\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Born to a gospel minister, Moore grew up singing in the church and was heavily influenced by the music of George Duke and Lee Ritenour. While in high school, she decided to make a career of singing. She was a successful beauty pageant contestant and model when she was discovered by the late Louil Silas at 22, a record executive who had started his own label, Silas Records, then distributed by MCA. Moore has recorded several hit records, including \"Love\\'s Taken Over\", \"Alright\", \"I\\'m What You Need\", \"Old School Lovin\\'\", and \"Free\" (a cover of a Deniece Williams\\' original song that showcases her effortless flip into whistle register by jumping an octave higher than the song\\'s original top note).

The band\\'s esthetic sense has been likened to the shoegazing scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s with favorably drawn comparisons to Slowdive, Spiritualized, and Ride as well as post-punk touchstones like New Order and the Jesus and Mary Chain.\\n\\nThe band began as a four-track recording project between friends, Matt Mirande and John (Randy) Rex in 1996. early recording activity produced a trio of 7\" singles self released under their own SharkAttack! imprint (also responsible for 7\" and CD releases by the bands, Lockgroove and Compass), the first of which was enthusiastically compared to Spacemen 3 in Brainwashed.  By 2002 Charlene (now expanded to a four piece with the addition of Ian Lawrence [drums] and Kelly Ferguson [bass]) released their eponymous debut album, again under the SharkAttack! label. East Coast tours with Bloodthirsty Lovers and Mark Gardener (ex-Ride) were undertaken to promote the debut, while Boston area support slots for touring acts such as Bedhead, Low, Elf Power, Fridge, Her Space Holiday and American Analog Set provided additional exposure.\\n\\nSince 2005 a fluctuating lineup (Rex and Mirande remain the only permanent members) has made live shows sporadic, although a tour was undertaken with the band Sons (Chapel Hill) in July of 2007.

       " 'Stevland Hardaway Morris (né Judkins; May 13, 1950), known professionally as Stevie Wonder, is an American singer-songwriter, who is credited as a pioneer and influence by musicians across a range of genres that include rhythm and blues, pop, soul, gospel, funk, and jazz. A virtual one-man band, Wonder\\'s use of synthesizers and other electronic musical instruments during the 1970s reshaped the conventions of R&B. He also helped drive such genres into the album era, crafting his LPs as cohesive and consistent, in addition to socially conscious statements with complex compositions. Blind since shortly after his birth, Wonder was a child prodigy who signed with Motown\\'s Tamla label at the age of 11, where he was given the professional name Little Stevie Wonder.\\n\\nWonder\\'s single \"Fingertips\" was a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1963, at the age of 13, making him the youngest artist ever to top the chart. Wonder\\'s critical success was at its peak in the 1970s. His \"classic period\" began in 1972 with the releases of Music of My Mind and Talking Book, the latter featuring \"Superstition\", which is one of the most distinctive and famous examples of the sound of the Hohner Clavinet keyboard. His works Innervisions (1973), Fulfillingness\\' First Finale (1974) and Songs in the Key of Life (1976) all won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, making him the tied-record holder for the most Album of the Year wins, with three. He is also the only artist to have won the award with three consecutive album releases. Wonder began his \"commercial period\" in the 1980s; he achieved his biggest hits and highest level of fame, had increased album sales, charity participation, high-profile collaborations (including Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson), political impact, and television appearances. Wonder has continued to remain active in music and political causes.\\n\\nWonder is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with sales of over 100 million records worldwide. He has won 25 Grammy Awards (the most by a solo artist) and one Academy Award (Best Original Song, for the 1984 film The Woman in Red). Wonder has been inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame. He is also noted for his work as an activist for political causes, including his 1980 campaign to make Martin Luther King Jr.\\'s birthday a federal holiday in the U.S. In 2009, he was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace, and in 2014, he was honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\\n\\nWonder was born Stevland Hardaway Judkins in Saginaw, Michigan, on May 13, 1950, the third of five children born to Lula Mae Hardaway, and the second of Hardaway\\'s two children with Calvin Judkins. He was born six weeks premature which, along with the oxygen-rich atmosphere in the hospital incubator, resulted in retinopathy of prematurity, a condition in which the growth of the eyes is aborted and causes the retinas to detach, so he became blind. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Stevie+Wonder\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Charles Aznavour (Shahnour Vaghenag Aznavourian, Armenian: Շահնուր Վաղինակ Ազնավուրյան, Paris, France, 22 May 1924 - 1 October 2018) was a French-Armenian singer, lyricist, actor, public activist and diplomat. Aznavour was known for his unique tenor voice: clear and ringing in its upper reaches, with gravelly and profound low notes. In a career spanning over 70 years, he recorded more than 1,200 songs interpreted in eight languages. For himself and others, he has written or co-written more than 1,000 songs. He was one of France\\'s most popular and enduring singers. He has sold 180 million records and has been dubbed France\\'s Frank Sinatra, while music critic Stephen Holden has described Aznavour as \"French pop deity.\" He was also arguably the most famous Armenian of his time. In 1998, Aznavour was named Entertainer of the Century by CNN and users of Time Online from around the globe. He was recognized as the century\\'s outstanding performer, with nearly 18% of the total vote, edging out Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan.\\nAznavour has sung for presidents, popes and royalty, as well as at humanitarian events. In response to the 1988 Armenian earthquake, he founded the charitable organization Aznavour for Armenia along with his long-time friend impresario Levon Sayan. In 2009, he was appointed ambassador of Armenia to Switzerland, as well as Armenia\\'s permanent delegate to the United Nations at Geneva. On 24 August 2017, Aznavour was awarded the 2,618th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  On 17 September 2018, his last concert took place in NHK Hall, Tokyo. \\nCharles Aznavour died on 1 October 2018.\\n\\nCharles Aznavour was perhaps the best-known French music hall entertainer in the world -- renowned the world over for the bittersweet love songs he has written and sung, which seem to embody the essence of French popular song, and also for his appearances on screen in such wildly divergent fare as Shoot the Piano Player, Candy, and The Tin Drum. His status as the quintessential French popular culture icon is something of an irony for a man who identifies himself most closely with his Armenian heritage. His father was a singer and sometime-restaurateur, while his mother was an actress and part-time seamstress. His father\\'s singing, done in a notably impassioned style, heavily influenced Aznavour\\'s approach to singing as a boy. Although he had a voracious appetite for music, he also had a serious impediment growing up, in the form of a paralyzed vocal cord that gave his voice a raspy quality. He channeled some of his energy into theater, making both his stage and screen debuts at age nine, in 1933, in the theater piece Un bon petit diable and in the film La guerre des gosses. As an adolescent, he danced in nightclubs and sold newspapers, as well as touring with theatrical companies, and he wrote a nightclub act in partnership with Pierre Roche -- Aznavour wrote the lyrics to their songs and it was through that material that he began his singing career. Early on, he learned to overcome his fears about his vocal limitations, in part with help from singing legend Édith Piaf, for whom he worked as a chauffeur, among other capacities; with her help, he developed a style that suited his capabilities and played to his strengths and also continued writing songs in earnest, some of which were performed by Piaf. \\n\\nHis success came very slowly, however. Aznavour at first found some difficulty being accepted as a composer in France or anywhere else. His compositions, although considered tame by any modern standard, were regarded as too risqué for French radio and were banned from the airwaves for a decade or more, from the late \\'40s through the end of the 1950s; American publishers seemed equally reticent about them, as he discovered on a visit to New York in 1948. That trip did yield his first performing engagement in the city, however, at the Cafe Society Downtown in Greenwich Village. For the next decade, Aznavour made his living as a performer in second-tier clubs and middle- or bottom-of-the-bill berths on three continents. His mix of daringly original and frank love songs, coupled with a limited but very expressive singing style, left audiences somewhat bewildered at first. \\n\\nHis breakthrough came in 1956, during a vaudeville engagement in Casablanca, where the audience reaction was so positive that Aznavour was moved to headliner status. After this, it became easier for the singer to find better engagements in France; by 1958 he even had a recording contract. He made his screen debut that same year in a dramatic role, playing an epileptic in George Franju\\'s La tête contre les murs. He also composed music for Alex Joff\\'s Du rififi chez les femmes in 1958; From there, he moved on to bigger roles in better movies, including Jean Cocteau\\'s Testament of Orpheus and Francois Truffaut\\'s Shoot the Piano Player. The latter movie turned Aznavour into a screen star in France and opened the way for his breakthrough in America. He sang at Carnegie Hall in the early \\'60s and followed this up in 1965 with a one-man show, The World of Charles Aznavour, at the Ambassador Hotel in New York, which drew rave notices from audiences and critics alike. By that time, the once-struggling singer had secured his first American LP release with the similarly titled album The World of Charles Aznavour on Reprise Records, the label founded and run by Frank Sinatra. \\n\\nAznavour would be the last to compare himself with those whom he regards as truly gifted vocalists, such as Sinatra and Mel Tormé, preferring to think of himself as a composer who also happens to sing. His style of performing has been compared variously to Maurice Chevalier and Sinatra and has remained enduringly popular for four decades. Almost all of Aznavour\\'s songs deal with love and its permutations, running the gamut from upbeat, joyous pieces such as Après l\\'amour and J\\'ai perdu la tête to the dark-hued J\\'en déduis que je t\\'aime and Bon anniversaire. A teetotaler and a racing car enthusiast, Aznavour has been married three times and has four children. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Charles+Aznavour\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Charles Brown (September 13, 1922 – January 21, 1999), born in Texas City, Texas was an American blues singer and pianist whose soft-toned, slow-paced blues-club style influenced the development of blues performance during the 1940s and 1950s. He had several hit recordings, including \"Driftin\\' Blues\" and \"Merry Christmas Baby\".\\n\\nIn the late 1940s a rising demand for blues was driven by an increasing white teenage audience in the South which quickly spread north and west. Blues shouters got the attention, but also greatly influential was what writer Charles Keil dubbs \"the postwar Texas clean-up movement in blues\" led by stylists such as T-Bone Walker, Amos Milburn and Charles Brown. Their singing was lighter, more relaxed and they worked with bands and combos that had saxophone sections and used arrangements.\\n\\nAs a child Brown demonstrated his love of music and took classical piano lessons. Early on, Brown moved out to Los Angeles, where the great influx of blacks created an integrated nightclub scene in which black performers tended to minimize the rougher blues elements of their style. The blues club style of a light rhythm bass and right-hand tinkling of the piano and smooth vocals became popular, epitomized by the jazz piano of Nat King Cole. When Cole left Los Angeles to perform nationally, his place was taken by Johnny Moore\\'s Three Blazers, featuring Charles Brown\\'s gentle piano and vocals.\\n\\nBrown signed with Aladdin Records and his 1945 recording on that label of the bestseller \"Driftin\\' Blues\" with a small combo was a typical club blues song. The single was on the R&B charts for six months, putting Brown at the forefront of a musical evolution that changed American musical performance. His style dominated the influential Southern California club scene on Central Avenue during that period and he influenced such performers as Floyd Dixon, Cecil Gant, Ivory Joe Hunter, Percy Mayfield, Johnny Ace and Ray Charles.\\n\\n\"Driftin\\'\" was the first of several hits Brown subsequently released \"Get Yourself Another Fool\", \"Black Night\", \"Hard Times\" and \"Trouble Blues\", all major hits in the early 1950s on such labels as Modern Records as well as Alladin. He was unable to compete with the burgeoning rock and roll sound, though he maintained a small and devoted audience.\\n\\nBrown\\'s approach was too mellow to survive the transition to rock\\'s harsher rhythms, and he faded from the national limelight. His Please Come Home for Christmas, a hit in 1960 on the King Records remained seasonally popular. During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, he occasionally recorded and tried to regain some prominence. This continued until the 1980s, when Bonnie Raitt helped usher in a Charles Brown comeback tour.\\n\\nHe began a recording and performing career again, under the musical direction of guitarist Danny Caron, to greater success than he had achieved since the 1950s. Several records received Grammy Award nominations.\\n\\nHe is a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and received both the National Endowment for the Arts\\' National Heritage Fellowship and the W. C. Handy Award.\\n\\nBrown died in 1999 in Oakland, California.\\n\\n.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Charles+Brown\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Charley Pride (born Charley Frank Pride on 18 March 1934; died 12 December 2020) was an American singer, musician, guitarist, business owner, and professional baseball player. His greatest musical success came in the early to mid-1970s, when he became the best-selling performer for RCA Records since Elvis Presley. During the peak years of his recording career (1966–87), he garnered 52 top-10 hits on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, 30 of which made it to number one. He also won the Entertainer of the Year award at the US Country Music Association Awards in 1971.\\n\\nBecoming a trailblazing Country Music superstar was an improbable destiny for Pride, especially considering his humble beginnings as a sharecropper’s son on a cotton farm in Sledge, Mississippi.  His unique journey to the top of the music charts includes a tumultuous detour through the world of Negro league, minor league and semi-pro baseball as well as many long years of labor alongside the vulcanic fires of a smelter.  But in the end, with boldness, perseverance and undeniable musical talent, he managed to parlay a series of fortuitous encounters with Nashville insiders into an amazing legacy of hit singles and tens of millions in record sales.  \\n\\nGrowing up, Pride was exposed primarily to Blues, Gospel and Country music.  His father inadvertently fostered Charley’s love of Country music by tuning the family’s Philco radio to Nashville’s WSM-AM in order to catch Grand Ole Opry broadcasts.  At 14 years of age, Pride purchased his first guitar—a Silvertone from a Sears Roebuck catalog—and taught himself how to play it by listening to the songs that he heard on that radio.  \\n\\nBy the age of 16, Pride began emerging as a talented baseball player.  He first played organized games in the Iowa State League and then professional games in the Negro American League as a pitcher and outfielder for the Memphis Red Sox.  In 1953, he signed a contract with the Boise Yankees, the Class C farm team of the New York Yankees.  But during that season an injury hampered his pitching.  He was first sent to the Yankees\\' Class D team in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin and then released.  Over the next several years, Charley rejoined the Memphis Red Sox, moved to the Louisville Clippers and then was traded, along with another player, to the Birmingham Black Barons for a used bus.  He also played for the El Paso Kings and a team in Nogales, Mexico.  Upon rejoining the Memphis Red Sox in 1956 he won 14 games as a pitcher and earned himself a position on the Negro American League All-Star Team.  As an all-star player that year, Pride pitched against a group of major league all-stars that included Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Al Smith, Gene Baker and Ernie Banks.\\n\\nBetween ballparks, Pride often passed the time and entertained teammates by singing and playing his guitar on the team bus.  And during these travels he happily joined performers onstage whenever he was given the opportunity.  \\n\\nIn late 1956 Pride was drafted by the US Army and ordered to report to Fort Chaffee, Arkansas for basic training.  During Christmas leave from basic training, he married his wife Rozene, who he had met earlier in the year while playing baseball in Memphis.  After basic training, he was stationed at Fort Carson, near Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he was assigned to quartermaster duty and the fort’s baseball team.  Upon receiving his discharge from the US Army in early 1958, Pride rejoined the Memphis Red Sox and returned to doggedly pursuing his dream of becoming a major league baseball pitcher.  \\n\\nIn 1960, Pride moved to Montana to play for the Missoula Timberjacks in the Pioneer League, but ended up working at a smelter operated by the Anaconda Mining Company and playing for its semi-pro baseball team, the East Helena Smelterites.  In 1961, he was invited to try out for the Los Angeles Angels during spring training but found himself heading back home to Helena, Montana after just two weeks.\\n\\nDuring the first half of the 1960’s, Pride continued to work at the smelter and play baseball for its semi-pro team.  But he also began making a name for himself as a music performer by singing the national anthem at baseball games and performing at honky-tonks and nightclubs in the Helena, Anaconda and Great Falls areas.  Sometimes he performed as a solo artist and other times as a member of a combo or group.\\n\\nIn 1962, with the help of Tiny Stokes, a local disc jockey, Pride was introduced to Country singers Red Sovine and Red Foley and invited to perform “Heartaches By The Numbers” and “Lovesick Blues” during one of their shows.  This brief initial encounter with Red Sovine would turn out to be crucial in laying the groundwork for Charley’s future music career.\\n\\nAfter a disastrous 1963 tryout with the New York Mets in Clearwater, Florida it became clear that a major league baseball career was not in the cards.  Charley chose to return to Montana via Tennessee because Red Sovine had told him that if he ever became serious about a singing career and decided to come to Nashville, he should stop by Cedarwood Publishing, the company that booked Sovine’s shows.  \\n\\nFrom the bus station in Nashville, Pride walked straight over to Cedarwood’s office and by sheer luck ended up meeting Jack Johnson, who had been actively searching for a promising black Country singer.  Johnson made a simply produced recording of Charley performing a couple of songs and then immediately drove him back to the bus station with the promise of a management contract.  Johnson quickly made good on that promise and it was the beginning of a working relationship that would start off slow, but prove to be very fruitful over the next decade.\\n\\nJohnson ran into significantly more resistance than he had anticipated as he shopped around the crude demo recording that he had made of Charley to the record labels in Nashville.  It wasn’t until 1965 that forward progress was made.  Charley came to Nashville and Johnson introduced him to producer, Jack Clement.  Clement gave Charley seven songs to learn and within a week they cut three of these songs–“The Snakes Crawl At Night”, “Atlantic Coastal Line”  and “Just Between You And Me”–during a three-hour studio session with top-notch session players.\\n\\nEven with the professionally produced sides, Johnson and Clement continued to have a difficult time as they shopped Charley around to the Nashville labels.  But finally in 1966, Chet Atkins decided to trust his ears and signed Charley to RCA Records.  Atkins took Charley under his wing, nurtured his talent and figured out how to dance past the race issue, which was no small feat during mid 1960s America.  Although Charley’s first couple of singles failed to jump-start his career, “Just Between You and Me” caught fire in 1967, breaking into the Top-10 Country chart and garnering Charley his first Grammy nomination. \\n\\nWhat happened next is Country Music history.  Charley Pride quickly became Country Music’s first African-American superstar.  Between 1967 and 1987, he amassed no fewer than 52 Top-10 Country hits and went on to sell tens of millions of records worldwide.  In 1971, Charley won two Grammy Awards related to his Gospel album Did You Think To Pray –“Best Sacred Performance, Musical (Non-Classical)” for the album, as well as “Best Gospel Performance Other Than Soul” for the single “Let Me Live.”  Later that year, his #1 crossover hit “Kiss An Angel Good Mornin’” sold over a million singles and helped him to win the Country Music Association’s “Entertainer of the Year” award and the “Top Male Vocalist” awards of 1971 and 1972.  It also brought him a “Best Male Country Vocal Performance” Grammy Award in 1972.  Some of Charley’s hits from his 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s output include “All I Have To Offer You Is Me,” “Is Anybody Goin’ To San Antone,” “Amazing Love,” “Mississippi Cotton Pickin’ Delta Town,” “Burgers And Fries,”  “Roll On Mississippi” and “Mountain Of Love.”  After parting ways with RCA Records in 1986, Charley spent the remainder of the decade releasing albums on the 16th Avenue Records label.  \\n\\nIn 1993, Charley was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry, 26 years after he had first played there as a guest.  On December 9th of that year he performed at the White House for President Bill Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton and many others during the Lighting of the National Christmas Tree celebration at President\\'s Park.\\n\\nPride: The Charley Pride Story, an autobiography that Charley wrote with the assistance of Jim Henderson, was published in 1994.  This book covers the events of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s in significantly more depth.\\n\\nIn 1994, he opened the Charley Pride Theatre in Branson Missouri where he performed for 4 years, doing nearly 200 shows yearly. Also in 1994, Pride was honored by the Academy of Country Music with its prestigious Pioneer Award.  And from 1994 until 1997, Pride released several albums on the Honest Entertainment record label.  \\n\\nIn 2000, Pride was honored with an induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame.  Shortly thereafter, he began releasing new music on the Music City Records label, including his critically acclaimed A Tribute To Jim Reeves (2001) and Pride And Joy: A Gospel Music Collection (2006) albums.\\n\\nCharley appeared in the 2009 documentary film, The Black List: Vol. 2, which aired on HBO.  The film is a component of The Black List Project, which interviews, films and photographs prominent African Americans of various professions, disciplines and backgrounds.\\n\\nOn July 21, 2009 Charley performed for President Barack Obama and guests in the historic East Room of the White House. His performance was part of a concert and educational workshop event (the White House Music Series) that also featured Brad Paisley and Alison Krauss. Hosted by Michelle Obama, the purpose of the event was to support the arts and demonstrate the continuing importance of arts education in America.\\n\\nAs part of an investment group spearheaded by Hall Of Game pitcher, Nolan Ryan, Charley became one of the owners of the Texas Rangers major league baseball team in 2010.  The investment group purchased the team in a federal bankruptcy auction just weeks before the Rangers appeared in the World Series for the first time in team history.  Charley has a long history with the Texas Rangers–he was invited to work out with the team during spring training in the 1970s and has continued to do so every year since.  Each February and March, Charley blocks off several weeks from his schedule so that he can work out with the team at their Arizona spring training facility.  In addition, Pride was drafted in 2008 by the Rangers during Major League Baseball’s ceremonial Special Negro League Player Draft.\\n\\nCharley’s latest studio album Choices will be released on March 8, 2011.  It features 13 new recordings written by such songwriters as Ted Harris (who wrote “Crystal Chandeliers”) and Ben Peters (who wrote “Kiss An Angel Good Morning” and many other Pride hits) as well as tracks penned by such fellow Country music stars as Eddy Raven and Richie McDonald (Lonestar).  \\n\\nCharley calls Dallas, Texas home.  He relocated his family from Helena to Great Falls, Montana in 1967 and then to Dallas in 1969.  \\n\\nAs of 2011, Charley continues to play 30 to 40 concert dates a year throughout the United States, Canada and Europe.  He also performs at the Grand Ole Opry several times each year and hosts an annual fan club breakfast in Nashville each June.  In addition to performing, recording new music and spending spring training with the Texas Rangers, he enjoys playing golf and spending time with his family.\\n\\nCharley Pride\\'s official website is at www.charleypride.com and his official Facebook page is at www.facebook.com/charleypride\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Charley+Pride\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Charles L. Byrd (September 16, 1925 - November 30, 1999), better known as Charlie Byrd, was a famous jazz guitarist, born in Suffolk, Virginia. He was the only jazz guitarist of that era whose primary instrument was the classical guitar which gave him his uniquely identifiable sound.\\n\\nByrd primarily looked up to Django Reinhardt. He moved to Washington, D.C., to study classical guitar with the renowned Sophocles Papas. He later moved to Italy where he studied with Andrés Segovia. In the early 1960\\'s he was on a State Department tour in South America where he was introduced to a new music, the bossa nova, which was the musical passion of Brazil beginning in the late 50\\'s. Jazz saxophonist Stan Getz had been in Brazil about six months earlier than Byrd, also on a State Department tour, where he, too, was exposed to the bossa nova. A short time later Getz called Byrd in D.C. and suggested the idea that they collaborate on a bossa nova album. That album was the introduction of bossa nova to North America.\\n\\nHe is perhaps most well known as a collaborator with Stan Getz on the Jazz Samba album, which featured many themes of bossa nova, and of course, samba. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Byrd\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'There are two artists known as Charlie Chaplin.\\n\\n1) Charlie Chaplin was a silent film actor, director and comedian, best known for his recurring character \"the little tramp\". Besides performing and directing, he also composed music to be played alongside his movies.\\n\\n2) Charlie Chaplin (born Richard Bennett is a Jamaican dancehall and ragga deejay and singer. It was common for Jamaican deejays of the era to name themselves after film stars or characters. Bennett, however, had been nicknamed after the comedian since his youth.  His career began in 1980 when he began working with U-Roy\\'s Stur-Gav Hi-Fi collective. He became extremely popular throughout Jamaica, memorable for his focus on cultural and social themes instead of the \"slack\" (rough, violent) lyrics that were popular at the time. His popularity as a live performer prompted Roy Cousins to produce some recording sessions with the young DJ. Chaplin\\'s debut album was the Cousins-produced Presenting Charlie Chaplin in 1982, with several albums following for the producer over the next 3 years.\\n\\nThe contrast between Chaplin\\'s \\'culture\\' lyrics and the slackness of the other major deejays of the day led to the 1984 \\'clash\\' album with Yellowman Slackness Vs Pure Culture.\\n\\nQue Dem (1985), produced by George Phang was popular, and was one of the most critically acclaimed albums of the time. His popularity declined sharply in the late 1980s and 1990s, though he continued recording, working with Bunny Roots, Josey Wales, Sly & Robbie, Henry \"Junjo\" Lawes, Roots Radics and Doctor Dread. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Chaplin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Charlie Daniels (born Charles Edward Daniels on October 28 1936 -  July 6 2020) was an American singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist known for his contributions to Southern rock, country, and bluegrass music. He is remembered for his US number-one country hit \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\". He was inducted into the Cheyenne Frontier Days Hall of Fame in 2002, the Grand Ole Opry in 2008, the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2009, and the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2016. \\n\\nDaniels began writing and performing in the 1950s. In 1964, Daniels wrote a song called \"It Hurts Me\" which Elvis Presley recorded. He worked as a session musician, including playing on three Bob Dylan albums during 1969 and 1970. Daniels recorded his first solo album, Charlie Daniels, in 1970. His first hit, the novelty song \"Uneasy Rider\", came off his 1972 second album, Honey in the Rock, and reached #9 on the Billboard Hot 100.\\n\\nIn 1974, Daniels organized the first in a series of Volunteer Jam concerts based in or around Nashville, Tennessee. Except for a three-year gap in the late 1980s, these have continued ever since.\\n\\nIn 1975, he had a top 30 hit as leader of the Charlie Daniels Band (CDB) with the Southern rock self-identification anthem \"The South\\'s Gonna Do It Again\". \"Long Haired Country Boy\" was also a minor hit in that year.\\n\\nDaniels won the Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance in 1979 for \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\", which reached #3 on the charts.\\n\\nSubsequent Daniels pop hits included \"In America\" (#11 in 1980), \"The Legend of Wooley Swamp\" (#31 in 1980), and \"Still in Saigon\" (#22 in 1982).\\n\\nIn the late 1980s and 1990s several of Daniels\\' albums and singles were hits on the country charts. Daniels also released several gospel and Christian records.\\n\\nCharlie Daniels has never shied away from politics. \"The South\\'s Gonna Do It\" had a mild message of Southern cultural identity within the Southern rock movement. Daniels was an early supporter of Jimmy Carter\\'s presidential bid and performed at his January 1977 inauguration.\\n\\n\"In America\" was a reaction to the 1979-1981 Iran Hostage Crisis; it described a patriotic, united America where \"we\\'ll all stick together and you can take that to the bank / That\\'s the cowboys and the hippies and the rebels and the yanks.\" In contrast, \"Still in Saigon\" (written by Dan Daley) was an effective portrayal of the plight of the American Vietnam veteran ten years after the war; it was part of an early 1980s wave of attention to the subject, in contrast to treatments such as Bruce Springsteen\\'s \"Born in the U.S.A.\" and \"Shut Out the Light\", Billy Joel\\'s \"Goodnight Saigon\", and somewhat later Steve Earle\\'s \"Copperhead Road\".\\n\\nIn 1990, Daniels\\' country hit \"Simple Man\" seemingly advocated a pseudo-Biblical form of vigilantism; lines such as \"Just take them [rapists, killers, child abusers] out in the swamp / Put \\'em on their knees and tie \\'em to a stump / Let the rattlers and the bugs and the alligators do the rest,\" got Daniels considerable media attention and talk show visits.\\n\\nIn 2003, Daniels published an Open Letter to the Hollywood Bunch in defence of George W. Bush\\'s Iraq policy. His 2003 book Ain\\'t No Rag: Freedom, Family, and the Flag contains this letter as well as many other personal statements. During the 2004 presidential campaign, Daniels acknowledged that having never served in the military himself, he did not have the right to criticize John Kerry\\'s service record. \\n\\nIn 2005, he has made a cameo appearance along with Larry the Cable Guy, Kid Rock, and Hank Williams, Jr. in Gretchen Wilson\\'s music video for the song \"All Jacked Up\", whose album has been released. \\n\\nIn November 2007, Daniels was invited by Martina McBride to become a member of the Grand Ole Opry. \\n\\nIn October 2016, Daniels officially became a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame. \\n\\nOn October 26, 2018, Daniels released a new side album project that was not solo or CDB, but a new band called Beau Weevils, along with CDB bass player, Charlie Hayward, producer James Stroud on drums and Billy Crain on guitar.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Daniels\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Charlie Drake (19 June 1925 – 23 December 2006), was an English comedian, actor, writer and singer.\\nWith his small stature, curly red hair and liking for slapstick he was a popular comedian with children in his early years, becoming nationally-known for his \"Hello, my darlings\" catchphrase.\\nHe recorded a remarkable number of records, the first of which, Splish Splash, a cover version of a rock and roll number originally recorded by Bobby Darin, got into the UK Top 10, but the rest were mostly novelty songs. One of these, My Boomerang Won\\'t Come Back, became a modest hit in the United States, where for the most part his work was otherwise not known.\\nIn 1975, Drake recorded a very unusual single for Charisma, unusual in that it is a novelty record with connections to the world of progressive rock. Written by Peter Gabriel and Martin Hall (who also co-wrote the light-hearted Excuse Me from Gabriel’s first solo album), the record has long been rumored to feature Genesis members and has been a source of great confusion for Genesis & Peter Gabriel collectors. Recently, in response to a post in the forum at www.philcollins.co.uk, Phil Collins offered the following recollection of the sessions for this single....\\n\\n\\'\\'....the post about Charlie Drake and his recording session brought back many memories. It did indeed feature Robert Fripp, Percy Jones, Keith Tippett, me and Peter G. A friend of Pete\\'s, Martin Hall wrote the song, or possibly co-wrote it with Peter, called You Never Know. Apparently Charlie Drake who was a huge comedy star of the 50\\'s and 60\\'s wanted to make a record. How he ended up with this line up I have no idea !!! It seems the most obscure set of people to make a comedy record. On the day Charlie, who was quite small, turned up with a brand new denim outfit for his rock debut....it was quite touching to see him at it.  Percy Jones and I were already in Brand X by then.

       " 'There are two artists known as Charlie McCoy:\\n\\n#1 Charles \"Papa Charlie\" McCoy (May 26, 1909 – July 26, 1950) was an African American delta blues musician and songwriter.\\n\\n#2 Charles Ray \"Charlie\" McCoy (born March 28, 1941 in Oak Hill, West Virginia) is an American session musician noted for his work on a wide variety of instruments. In his career, McCoy has backed several notable musicians including Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, Tom Astor, Elvis Presley and Ween. He has also recorded thirty-seven studio albums, including fourteen for Monument Records. Thirteen of his singles have entered the Billboard country charts. He was a member of Area Code 615 and Barefoot Jerry.\\n\\n#1 Charlie McCoy was born in Jackson, Mississippi, he was best known by the nickname \\'Papa Charlie\\'. He became one of the major blues accompanists of his time. A guitarist and mandolin player, he played in the Mississippi area with his band, The Mississippi Hot Footers.\\nMcCoy recorded several sides with Bo Carter as the \\'Mississippi Mud Steppers\\'. Among the tracks recorded with Carter were two variations of Cow Cow Davenport\\'s \"Cow Cow Blues\" . The first, an instrumental, was released as \"The Jackson Stomp\". The second, with lyrics and vocals by McCoy, as \"The Lonesome Train, That Took My Girl From Town\". They also wrote and recorded \"The Vicksburg Stomp\" which was resurrected and recorded by Mike Compton, of O Brother, Where Art Thou? fame.\\nHis nimble, sensitive guitar work enriched recordings from performers including Tommy Johnson and Ishman Bracey. He recorded regularly in the late 1920s, often alongside Walter Vincson. He dated blues singer and guitar player Geeshie Wiley around 1928. He also sat in with the Mississippi Sheiks, Rubin Lacy, Son Spand and the many other Delta bluesmen who passed through the Jackson area in the years that followed. He also backed his then sister-in-law, Memphis Minnie in the mid 1930s.\\nAs a slide guitarist, McCoy recorded as under the name of Tampa Kid, and released \"Keep On Trying\".\\nMcCoy also joined and performed with his brother (Kansas Joe McCoy) for many years, and they released records under the title of \"The McCoy Brothers\".\\nHe eventually migrated to Chicago where he organized two bands, \"Papa Charlie\\'s Boys\" and with his older brother Kansas Joe McCoy, the Harlem Hamfats, that performed and recorded during the second half of the 1930s. However, service with the United States Army during World War II cut short McCoy’s career.\\nIn poor health, McCoy never returned to music after the war, and he died in Chicago, Illinois in 1950 from paralytic brain disease, only a few months after his brother had died. They are both buried in the Restvale Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois.\\nMcCoy\\'s composition, \"Too Long\" was recorded several times by both black and white artists.\\n\\n#2 Charlie McCoy and his family moved to nearby Fayetteville when he was a boy and then to Miami, Florida. At age eight, he began playing the harmonica and the guitar and later, in his teens, he also learned to play the bass and trumpet. In high school in Miami his skills had developed to such an extent that he decided to pursue a career in music. He joined a local rock and roll band as guitarist and singer. When he was sixteen years old he reluctantly accompanied a friend to visit a country barn dance radio show in Miami called the \"Old South Jamboree\". Upon their arrival, McCoy\\'s friend left him in the crowd and went to talk to Happy Harold, the host of the show, with the intention of coaxing McCoy up on stage to sing. McCoy\\'s performance that night, along with the positive response from the show\\'s audience, led to him and his rock band being signed to the Old South Jamboree. His band consisted of Donny Young, later known as Johnny Paycheck, on bass; Bill Johnson on steel-guitar; Charlie Justice on guitar; and Bill Phillips, vocal. About this time the band took part in a local rock and roll contest winning first prize. Following an invitation from Mel Tillis, the eighteen-year-old McCoy went to Nashville, Tennessee for a week\\'s stay in 1959. During his stay in Nashville he visited numerous producers and record companies but all to no avail. Since his efforts to start a musical career in Nashville had failed he went back to Miami. He enrolled at the Miami University[citation needed] majoring in musical education. His goal was now to become a teacher. Meanwhile he continued to perform on the \"Jamboree\". When Miami faculty members discovered that he was playing rock and roll for a square dance they warned him to continue with this \"lower forms of music\". McCoy replied that he was willing to quit his work at the barn dance if they would give him a scholarship. The faculty rejected his request.\\nMcCoy, who still wanted to make a career in music, applied for the vacant job as guitarist in John Ferguson\\'s band. But when he arrived in Nashville, due to some misunderstanding, his job was already taken by guitarist Vance Bullock. After a short discussion Ferguson decided to hire McCoy as a drummer instead. McCoy bought a drum set and joined the band. John Ferguson\\'s band was unsuccessful and shortly they disbanded. After a month of unemployment he joined Stonewall Jackson as a drummer. The job came to an end in the autumn that year. Then he received a call from the booking agent Jim Denney who informed him that Archie Bleyer of Cadence Records had listened to McCoy\\'s tapes and wanted to sign him. McCoy cut his first single for the Cadence label and \"Cherri Berri Wine\" reached No. 99 in the Billboard chart. In Nashville, Denney gave him the advice to do demo sessions and to concentrate on the harmonica. Next, McCoy joined Wayne Moss as a bass player performing at Fort Campbell in Kentucky.\\nChet Atkins heard one of McCoy\\'s demo tapes and immediately hired him in May 1961. Thus, his first recording as a harmonica player was on a song, \"I Just Don\\'t Understand\", by Ann-Margret for RCA. Fred Foster of Monument Records also heard about McCoy and hired him as harmonica player on Roy Orbison\\'s song \"Candy Man\". It became a million-seller. McCoy\\'s reputation as harmonica player and studio musician increased. McCoy continued to record for the Monument label without a written contract. Although some of his singles and albums at this time did not sell, Foster believed in McCoy\\'s music. Tex Davis, the promotion manager of Monument Records, was persuaded by Charlie Dillard of WPFA to release \"Today I Started Loving You Again\" as a single. It had previously been released on McCoy\\'s second LP. When the single came out in 1972 it sold 750 000 copies. The single went to No. 16 in the Billboard country charts. For his next album, \"The Real McCoy\", he won a grammy from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. His album \"Good Time Charlie\" reached No. 1 in the Billboard country chart. In the 1970s, McCoy, as a studio musician, took part in more than 400 sessions a year. He has won 2 CMA Awards and 7 ACM Awards.\\nFrom there, he went on to play harmonica for other acts, Elvis Presley, Perry Como, Joan Baez, Johnny Cash, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Kris Kristofferson, Paul Simon, Ringo Starr, Barefoot Jerry, \"Gene Summers In Nashville\" LP and Ween. He also played guitar on Dylan\\'s \"Desolation Row\", from the album Highway 61 Revisited, and \"Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\", from the album Blonde on Blonde,) bass guitar (on all the tracks from Bob Dylan\\'s John Wesley Harding,) keyboards, and drums plus on several wind and brass instruments. For 19 years McCoy worked as music director for the popular television show, Hee Haw, and was a member of the Million Dollar Band.\\nOn May 17, 2009 Charlie was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame along with Roy Clark and Barbara Mandrell. He is also a member of the International Musicians\\' Hall of Fame, and the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame.\\nCharlie has two children with his first wife, and five grandchildren. All of his grandchildren have contributed to one of his albums in some way. His second granddaughter did the artwork for one of the albums covers (Somewhere Over The Rainbow) and sang on one of his Christmas CDs. His oldest granddaughter has played flute and sang on a few of his albums.

       " 'Charles (Charlie) Rich (December 14, 1932 – July 25, 1995) was an American country music singer and musician. His eclectic-style of music was often hard to classify in a single genre, encompassing in the rockabilly, jazz, blues, country, and gospel genres.\\nIn the latter part of his life, Rich acquired the nickname The Silver Fox. He is perhaps best remembered for a pair of 1973 hits, \"Behind Closed Doors\" and \"The Most Beautiful Girl\". \"The Most Beautiful Girl\" topped the U.S. country singles charts, as well as the pop singles charts and earned him two Grammy Awards.\\n\\nThough he resided in Benton, Arkansas, from around 1960 to 1981, Rich was born in Colt, Arkansas, to rural cotton farmers. His professional musical career began while he was in the U.S. Air Force in the early 1950s. His first musical group, the Velvetones, played jazz and blues and featured his fiancée, Margaret Ann, on lead vocals. Rich left the military in 1955 and tried to farm five acres in Tennessee. He also began performing in clubs around the Memphis area, playing both jazz and R&B. It was during these hard times that he began writing his own material.\\n\\nRich was a session musician for Judd Records, owned by Judd Phillips, the brother of Sun Records founder Sam Phillips. After recording some demos for Sam Phillips at Sun Records that Phillips didn\\'t find commercial enough, and too jazzy, legend has it that he was given a stack of Jerry Lee Lewis records and told: \"come back when you get that bad.\" A September 6, 2010 NPR airing of 1992 interview with Fresh Air host Terry Gross Charlie Rich tells the story himself of Bill Justis telling Rich\\'s wife those exact words. In 1958, Rich became a regular session musician for Sun Records playing on records by Lewis, Johnny Cash, Bill Justis, Warren Smith, Billy Lee Riley, Carl Mann, and Ray Smith. He also wrote songs for Lewis, Cash, and others.\\nHis third single for the Sun subsidiary, Phillips International Records, was the 1960 Top 30 hit, \"Lonely Weekends,\" noted for its Presley-like vocals. None of his seven follow-up singles was a success, though several of the songs became staples in his live set, including \"Who Will the Next Fool Be,\" \"Sittin\\' and Thinkin\\',\" and \"No Headstone on My Grave.\" These songs were often recorded by others to varying degrees of success, such as the Bobby Bland version of \"Who Will the Next Fool Be.\"\\nRich\\'s career stalled, and he left the struggling Sun label in 1963, signing with a subsidiary of RCA Records, Groove. His first single for Groove, \"Big Boss Man,\" was a minor hit, but again his Chet Atkins-produced follow-ups all stiffed. Rich moved to Smash Records early in 1965. Rich\\'s new producer, Jerry Kennedy, encouraged the pianist to emphasize his country and rock & roll leanings, although Rich considered himself a jazz pianist and had not paid much attention to country music since his childhood. The first single for Smash was \"Mohair Sam,\" an R&B-inflected novelty-rock number, and it became a Top 30 pop hit. Unfortunately again for Rich, none of his follow-up singles were successful. Rich was forced to change labels, moving over to Hi Records, where he recorded blue-eyed soul music and straight country, but none of his singles made a dent on the country or pop charts. One Hi Records track Love Is After Me from 1966 belatedly became a white soul favourite in the early 1970s.\\n\\nDespite his lack of consistent commercial success, Epic Records signed Rich in 1967, mainly on the recommendation of producer Billy Sherrill. Sherrill helped Rich refashion himself as a Nashville Sound balladeer during an era when old rock n\\' rollers like Jerry Lee Lewis and Conway Twitty were finding a new musical home in the country and western format. This new \"Countrypolitan\" Rich sound paid off in the summer of 1972, when \"I Take It on Home\" went to number six in the country charts. The title track from his 1973 album, Behind Closed Doors, became a number one hit early in that year, crossing over into the Top 20 on the pop charts. This time his follow-up did not disappoint, as \"The Most Beautiful Girl\" spent three weeks at the top of the country charts and two weeks at the top of the pop charts. Now that he was established as a country music star, Behind Closed Doors won three awards from the Country Music Association that year: Best Male Vocalist, Album of the Year, and Single of the Year. The album was also certified gold. Rich won a Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance, and he took home four ACM awards. One of RCA\\'s several resident songwriters, Marvin Walters, co-wrote for three years with Charlie producing four recordings including a very popular \"Set Me Free\".\\nAfter \"The Most Beautiful Girl\", number one hits came quickly, as five songs topped the country charts in 1974 and crossed over to the pop charts. The songs were \"There Won\\'t Be Anymore\" (Pop No. 18), \"A Very Special Love Song\" (Pop No. 11), \"I Don\\'t See Me In Your Eyes Anymore\" (Pop No. 47), \"I Love My Friend\" (Pop No. 24), and \"She Called Me Baby\" (Pop No. 47). Both RCA and Mercury (Smash was a subsidiary of Mercury which was absorbed into the main company in 1970) re-released his previously recorded material from the mid-1960s, as well. All of this success led the CMA to name him Entertainer of the Year in 1974. In the same year he performed the Academy Award nominated theme song I feel love (Benji\\'s Theme) from the film Benji. Rich had three more top five hits in 1975, but even though he was at the peak of his popularity, Rich began to drink heavily, causing considerable problems off-stage.\\nRich\\'s destructive personal behavior famously culminated at the CMA awards ceremony for 1975, when he presented the award for Entertainer of the Year, while visibly intoxicated. Instead of reading the name of the winner, who happened to be John Denver, he set fire to the envelope with a cigarette lighter, before announcing the award had gone to \"My friend Mr. John Denver.\" Some considered it an act of rebellion against the Music Row-controlled Nashville Sound. But many speculated that Rich\\'s behavior was a protest against the award going to Denver, whose music Rich had considered too \"pop,\" and not enough \"country.\"[2] Others, including industry insiders, were outraged, and Rich had trouble having hits throughout 1976, and only had one top ten with \"Since I Fell For You.\"\\nThe slump in his career was exacerbated by the fact that his records began to sound increasingly similar: pop-inflected country ballads with overdubbed strings and little of the jazz or blues Rich had performed his entire life. He did not have a top ten hit again until \"Rollin\\' With the Flow\" in 1977 went to number one. Early in 1978, he signed with United Artists Records, and throughout that year, he had hits on both Epic and UA. His hits in 1978 included the top ten hits \"Beautiful Woman,\" \"Puttin\\' In Overtime At Home,\" and his last number one with \"On My Knees,\" a duet with Janie Fricke.\\n\\nRich struggled throughout 1979 having hits with United Artists and Epic. His singles were moderate hits that year, the biggest of them on either UA or Epic was a version of \"Spanish Eyes,\" which became a top 20 country hit. Rich appeared as himself in the 1978 Clint Eastwood movie, Every Which Way but Loose, in which he performed the song \"I\\'ll Wake You Up When I Get Home.\" This song hit number three on the charts in 1979 and was his last top ten single. In 1980, he switched labels again to Elektra Records, and released a number twelve single, \"A Man Just Don\\'t Know What a Woman Goes Through\" in the fall of that year. One more Top 40 hit followed, the Gary Stewart song \"Are We Dreamin\\' the Same Dream\" early in 1981, but Rich decided to remove himself from the spotlight. For over a decade, Rich was silent, living off his investments in semi-retirement and only playing occasional concerts. Also played a bit part in the 1981 movie Take This Job and Shove It as a recent oil millionaire looking for an investment into the Beer Brewery Business.\\nIn 1992, Rich released Pictures and Paintings, a jazzy record that was produced by journalist Peter Guralnick. It was released on Sire Records. Pictures and Paintings received positive critical reviews and restored Rich\\'s reputation as a musician, but it would be his last record. One of his opening acts in these years was Tom Waits, who mentioned him in the song \"Putnam County\" from his album Nighthawks at the Diner with the lyric: \"The radio\\'s spitting out Charlie Rich... He sure can sing, that son of a bitch.\"\\n\\nCharlie Rich was traveling to Florida with his wife from Natchez, Mississippi, where he watched his son perform with Freddy Fender at a local casino, when he experienced a bout of severe coughing. After visiting a doctor in St. Francisville, Louisiana and receiving antibiotics, he continued traveling until he stopped to rest for the night. He died in his sleep on July 25, 1995, in a Hammond, Louisiana motel. He was 62 years old. The cause of death was a pulmonary embolism. He was buried in the Memorial Park Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.\\nAt the time, Charlie Rich was survived by his wife of 43 years, Margaret; two sons, Allan and Jack; two daughters, Rene and Laurie; and grandchildren Maggie Carber Yelverton, Wesley Carber, and Christian Cole Lee. Margaret Rich passed away in Germantown, Tennessee on September 22, 2010 and was buried next to her husband.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCharlie Rich was simultaneously one of the most critically acclaimed and most erratic country singers of post-World War II era. Rich had all the elements of being one of the great country stars of the \\'60s and \\'70s, but his popularity never matched his critical notices. What made him a critical favorite also kept him from mass success. Throughout his career, Rich willfully bended genres, fusing country, jazz, blues, gospel, rockabilly, and soul. Though he had 45 country hits in a career that spanned nearly four decades, he became best-known for his lush, Billy Sherrill-produced countrypolitan records of the early \\'70s. Instead of embracing the stardom those records brought him, Rich shunned it, retreating into semiretirement by the \\'80s.\\n\\nRich began his professional musical career while he was enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in the early \\'50s. While he was stationed in Oklahoma, he formed a group called the Velvetones, which played jazz and blues and featured his fiancée, Margaret Ann, on lead vocals. Rich left the military in 1956, and he began performing clubs around the Memphis area, playing both jazz and R&B; he also began writing his own material. Rich managed to land a job as a session musician for Judd Records, which was owned by Judd Phillips, the brother of Sun Records founder Sam Phillips. Around this time, saxophonist and Sun recording artist Bill Justis heard Rich play at the Sharecropper Club and asked the pianist to write arrangements for him. Sam saw Rich perform with Justis at a club gig and asked him to record some demos at Sun Studios. Phillips rejected the resulting demos, claiming they were too jazzy. After absorbing some Jerry Lee Lewis records Justis gave him, Rich returned to Sun quickly and became a regular session musician for the label in 1958, playing and/or singing on records by Lewis, Johnny Cash, Justis, Warren Smith, Billy Lee Riley, Carl Mann, and Ray Smith. He was also writing songs, including \"Break Up\" for Lewis, \"The Ways of a Woman in Love\" for Cash, and \"I\\'m Comin\\' Home\" for Mann, which was later cut by Elvis Presley.\\n\\nIn August of 1958, Rich released his first single, \"Whirlwind,\" for the Sun subsidiary Phillips International. Throughout 1959, he recorded a number of songs at Sun, though only a handful were actually released. Rich didn\\'t have a hit until 1960, when his third Phillips International single, \"Lonely Weekends,\" became a Top 30 pop hit. However, none of its seven follow-up singles were a success, though several of the songs would become staples in his set, including \"Who Will the Next Fool Be?,\" \"Sittin\\' and Thinkin\\',\" and \"Midnight Blues.\" In the early \\'60s, Rich\\'s career remained stalled. He left Sun Records in 1964, signing with Groove, a newly established subsidiary of RCA. His first single, \"Big Boss Man,\" was an underground, word-of-mouth hit, but its Chet Atkins-produced follow-ups all stiffed. On Groove, he jazzily interpreted standards, but he also performed a handful of originals, including \"Tomorrow Night\" and \"I Don\\'t See Me in Your Eyes Anymore.\" Groove went out of business by the beginning of 1965, leaving Rich without a record contract.\\n\\nUnder the direction of Shelby Singleton, Smash Records signed Rich early in 1965. Singleton and Rich\\'s producer, Jerry Kennedy, encouraged the pianist to emphasize his country and rock & roll leanings. The first single for Smash was \"Mohair Sam,\" an R&B-inflected novelty number written by Dallas Frazier. \"Mohair Sam\" became a Top 30 pop hit, but none of its follow-ups were successful. Again, Rich changed labels, moving over to Hi Records, where he recorded straight country, but none of his singles for the label made any impression on the country charts.\\n\\nDespite his lack of consistent commercial success, Epic Records signed Rich in 1967, mainly on the recommendation of producer Billy Sherrill. Sherrill helped Rich refashion himself as a Nashville-based, smooth, middle-of-the-road balladeer. At first, the singles were only moderately successful — \"Set Me Free\" and \"Raggedy Ann\" charted in the mid-40s in 1968 — but persistence paid off in the summer of 1972, when \"I Take It on Home\" rocketed to number six. \"I Take It on Home\" set the stage for Rich\\'s big breakthrough into the mainstream, 1973\\'s Behind Closed Doors album. The title track from the record became a number one hit early in 1973, crossing over into the Top 20 on the pop charts. Following the success of \"Behind Closed Doors,\" RCA re-released \"Tomorrow Night,\" which reached the Top 30, but it was \"The Most Beautiful Girl,\" the proper follow-up to his first number one single, that established him as a star. \"The Most Beautiful Girl\" spent three weeks at the top of the country charts and two weeks at the top of the pop charts. Behind Closed Doors won three awards from the Country Music Association that year: Best Male Vocalist, Album of the Year, and Single of the Year for the title track. The album was also certified gold, Rich won a Grammy for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male, and he also took home four ACM awards.\\n\\nAfter \"The Most Beautiful Girl,\" number one hits came quickly — \"There Won\\'t Be Anymore\" (re-released from his RCA sessions), \"A Very Special Love Song,\" \"I Don\\'t See Me in Your Eyes Anymore\" (also from RCA), \"I Love My Friend,\" and \"She Called Me Baby\" (RCA) all topped the country charts, and several of the songs also crossed over into the pop charts. Mercury began re-releasing his Smash recordings, and two of them — \"A Field of Yellow Daisies\" and \"Something Just Came Over Me\" — became minor hits. All of this success led the CMA to name him Entertainer of the Year in 1974.\\n\\nRich didn\\'t quite dominate the charts in 1975 as he did the previous year, but he did have three Top Five hits: \"My Elusive Dreams,\" \"Every Time You Touch Me (I Get High),\" and \"All Over Me,\" plus the Top Ten \"Since I Fell For You.\" Even though he was at the peak of his popularity, Rich had begun to drink heavily, causing considerable problems off-stage. His destructive behavior culminated at the CMA ceremony for 1975, when he presented the award for that year\\'s Entertainer of the Year. Instead of reading the name of the winner, he set fire to the certificate that named the new winner, who happened to be John Denver. Fans and industry insiders were outraged, and Rich had trouble having hits throughout 1976 — none of his singles cracked the Top 20.\\n\\nThe slump in his career couldn\\'t be completely attributed to Rich\\'s behavior. His records had begun to sound increasingly similar, as he and Sherrill were working over the same territory they began exploring in 1968. There were exceptions — such as 1976\\'s acclaimed gospel record, Silver Linings — but it took Rich until 1977 to break back into the Top Ten with the number one \"Rollin\\' With the Flow.\" Early in 1978, he signed with United Artists and throughout that year had hits on both Epic and UA. Rich worked at United Artists with Larry Butler, a producer who had a similar style to Sherrill. Epic continued to have hits, as \"Beautiful Woman\" reached the Top Ten in the summer and a duet with Janie Fricke, \"On My Knees,\" became his last number one hit that fall. \"I\\'ll Wake You Up When I Get Home,\" taken from the Clint Eastwood movie Every Which Way but Loose, was a number three hit early in 1979; it would be his last Top Ten single.\\n\\nRich struggled to have a big hit throughout 1979, but none of his singles were anything more than a minor success. In 1980, he switched labels to Elektra, resulting in the number 12 single \"A Man Just Don\\'t Know What a Woman Goes Through\" in the fall of that year. One more Top 40 hit followed — \"Are We Dreamin\\' the Same Dream\" early in 1981 — but Rich decided to remove himself from the spotlight. For over a decade, Rich was silent, living in semiretirement and only playing the occasional concert. He returned in 1992 with Pictures and Paintings, a jazzy record produced by journalist Peter Guralnick and released on Sire.\\n\\nPictures and Paintings received positive reviews and restored Rich\\'s reputation, but it would be his last record. Rich died from a blood clot in his lung in the summer of 1995, when he was travelling to Florida with his wife, Margaret Ann.\\n\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Rich\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Charles Wayne Sexton (born August 11, 1968) is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter, best known as the guitarist for Bob Dylan\\'s backing band from 1999 to 2002.\\n\\nSexton\\'s mother was 16 years old when she gave birth to him in San Antonio, Texas. When he was four, he and his mother moved to Austin, where clubs like the Armadillo World Headquarters, the Soap Creek Saloon, and more notably the Split Rail and Antone\\'s Blues Club exposed him to popular music.\\n\\nAfter a brief period living outside of Austin with his mother, Sexton moved back to Austin at the age of 12. With the help of Joe Ely and other local musicians such as Jimmie and Stevie Ray Vaughan, Sexton developed his talents as a musician.\\n\\nSexton was soon regarded as a musical prodigy, and he toured with a variety of musical acts during his early teens before releasing his debut album, Pictures For Pleasure, in 1985. Recorded when he was 16 years old, it yielded the Top 20 hit single, \"Beat\\'s So Lonely.\"\\n\\nWhile still in his late teens, Sexton\\'s skills as a guitar player were in great demand, and he became a popular session player, recording with artists like Ron Wood, Keith Richards, Don Henley, and Bob Dylan. He eventually followed up his debut with the self-titled Charlie Sexton, recorded at the age of twenty.\\n\\nSexton later contributed songs to various motion picture soundtracks, including True Romance and Air America while making a cameo fronting a bar band in Thelma & Louise. It was around this time, between 1992 and 1994, that Sexton was a member of Austin\\'s Arc Angels. A blues rock band featuring Texas musicians Doyle Bramhall II, Tommy Shannon and Chris \"Whipper\" Layton, the group recorded one self-titled album, released in 1992 on Geffen Records, before they disbanded.\\n\\nSexton soon formed a new group, the Charlie Sexton Sextet, and released Under The Wishing Tree in 1995 on MCA Records. Though sales were considered disappointing, it was met with critical acclaim.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Sexton continued to perform with other artists, appearing on such notable albums as Lucinda Williams\\'s Car Wheels on a Gravel Road and Shawn Colvin\\'s Grammy-winning album A Few Small Repairs.\\n\\nIn 1999, Sexton was hired by Bob Dylan to replace Bucky Baxter. Sexton had previously played with Dylan during a pair of Austin, Texas concerts in 1996, and on some demos recorded in the fall of 1983.\\n\\nSexton\\'s residency with Dylan brought him great exposure, with many critics singling out the interplay between him and Larry Campbell, who was also a guitarist in Dylan\\'s backing band. Hailed as one of Dylan\\'s best bands, the group recorded a number of studio recordings, including Things Have Changed (from the 1999 film the Wonder Boys) and 2001\\'s critically acclaimed album, Love and Theft. He also performed and appeared with them in 2003\\'s Masked & Anonymous.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Sexton continued working with other artists, producing Double Trouble\\'s Been a Long Time and Lucinda Williams\\'s Essence, both released in 2001. Since leaving Dylan\\'s band, Sexton has produced numerous other works, including Edie Brickell\\'s Volcano (2003), Jon Dee Graham\\'s Great Battle (2004), Shannon McNally\\'s Geronimo (2005), and Los Super Seven\\'s Heard It on the X (2005).

       " 'As the lead singer of brotherly trio the Gap Band, the pioneering group whose late 70’s early 80’s funk still serves as a guiding light for producers and singers, it has been a long road for Charlie Wilson. From the dusty roads of Tulsa, Oklahoma to the neon lights of Cali to being homeless in the city of angels, the brother has seen it all. \"I went from riches to rags,\" Charlie laughs. \"But now it’s time for me to take it back to the stage with ‘Charlie, Last Name Wilson’.\"\\n\\nAnyone familiar with the rhythmic repertoire of the Gap band, including classic tracks \"You Dropped a Bomb on Me,\" \"Burn Rubber (Why You Wanna Hurt Me),\" and \"Yearning for Your Love,\" can hear traces of Charlie in the contemporary voices of current R&B royalty. Their music continues to be sampled by hundreds of artists including Madonna, Usher, Mary J. Blige, Ashanti, Will Smith, and George Michael to name a few.\\n\\n\"From day one, R. Kelly has always proclaimed himself a modern day Charlie Wilson,\" he says. \"He and I have been talking about collaborating for years, and now it’s finally happening.\" On Charlie, Last Name Wilson, his first disc since 2001, the former cowboy boot wearing bro is now gator stepping in Chi-town with the king of urban grooves. \"This was a big step for me, because the Gap band always did our own music,\" Wilson recalls. \"Letting others write and produce for me, is a big step.\" Fortunately, coming through on his promise, R. Kelly has stepped to the plate to produce four mackadelic tracks.\\n\\n\"The first song we recorded was the title track. I already knew he was talented, but it was then I realized he’s a genius.\" With his own classic appeal, Charlie Wilson possess a style that has never gone out of style, the kind of voice that can be gutbucket and cool, smooth as hot butter and tasty as chocolate. \"Charlie, Last Name Wilson\" is the kind of urban romancer that will appeal to both old souls hanging in the spot and R&B kids chilling on the block.\\n\\nThe instant classic \"No Words,\" is an exquisite track that has an eternal pop sound comparable to Burt Bacharach, Curtis Mayfield or Babyface. With this enchanting song, sonic Chicago architect R. Kelly has constructed one of the finest \"drama\" ballads of his career. \"That is my favorite song, because it’s so powerful,\" Charlie says. \"Basically, it’s me singing from the woman’s perspective. I know some men are going to be mad that I’m saying these things, because now they might have to stop playing basketball long enough to buy their lady some flowers.\"\\n\\nProving himself to be more than a balladeer, the smoking \"So Hot\" is the kind of popping dance-floor track one might not expect to hear. A master blaster for the BET generation, one can imagine booming speakers, slinking girls and enough sweat to swim through without drowning. Indeed, with a brilliant collection of material, Charlie, Last Name Wilson has created the perfect re-introduction for contemporary audiences to embrace.\\n\\nThrowing down some new tricks, the upbeat groove of \"Magic\" is a whimsical song with Uncle Charlie (that’s what the kids call him) playing the roll of a magician—the kind who can blink his eye, mumble a few words and make your clothes disappear. \"It’s all about being able to work that charm,\" Wilson says slyly. Abracadabra, hocus pocus and all that jazz…\\n\\nRaised the son of a preacher man and a strict mother, Charlie recalls his Tulsa days with the fondness of a Hallmark card. \"It was the kind of place where you could go to any door and borrow a cup of sugar,\" he says. \"I had a very happy childhood.\" Though his mother did not want him sullying his ears with secular sounds, he says, \"Pops didn’t care, because he had a nephew who was a blues musician. Every time he came around his car had shiny wheels and slicked back hair; he wore sharkskin suits and always had a car full of women. I knew then, that is what I wanted to do.\\n\\nInspired by the black velveteen of Sam Cooke and the Motown sound of Little Stevie Wonder, young Charlie began performing in local night spots while still a teen. \"I would be playing for the same people at night that was teaching us during the day. We were playing grown folk’s music when we were still kids.\" Teaming with his brothers in 1967 Wilson proudly says, \"And we’re still performing together today. We may not see eye to eye on everything, but we are family first. Some crazy things have gone down over the years, but family is the mother ship; and that big ship is the Gap Band.\"\\n\\nIn addition to their \"roof is on fire\" jams, the Gap Band was also known for making cowboy gear cool in the hood. \"People used to tease us, because we came from Okalahoma,\" Charlie laughs. \"So we just decided to dress like cowboys. When we put on the hat and boots, we knew it looked corny, but we did not care. That’s our look.\"\\n\\nThough Charlie has had his share of wealth, he has also had his share of demons. Partying hard and living close to the edge, Charlie lost everything due to bad decisions and drug abuse. \"I went from living in a mansion to living on the street,\" Charlie confesses. \"I had strangers living in my house, stealing my cars. I had hit rock bottom. If it wasn’t for God and my wife, who knows where I would be today.\"\\n\\nAfter the recording with R.Kelly in the windy city, Charlie returned to his adopted hometown of Los Angeles, going straight to the studio with superstar label-mate Justin Timberlake and Black Eyed Peas auteur Will.i.am. \"Justin is a very talented kid,\" says Wilson. \"We had worked together on a project with Snoop. We were hanging-out in my trailer when I asked if he wanted to be a part of the project. Justin is a real humble guy.\" Called \"Floatin’,\" the track is bound to introduce Charlie Wilson to a brand new crowd. Simultaneously laidback and funky, there is a certain bliss one feels when listening to this song. Like an easy Sunday morning, \"Floatin’\" will make you feel good. \"Will is like a modern day Sly Stone,\" he says. \"He is on his way to great things.\"\\n\\nFor sure, Charlie Wilson knows about great things. From those early days touring with the Rolling Stones to being a major headliner in the early ‘80s, the Gap Band always brought the party. \"When we performed it was all about showmanship,\" informs Wilson. \"That’s what I think is missing in music right now, and I’m ready to bring it back.\"\\n\\nThe track for former new jack swing fans is Wilson’s remake of Guy’s classic ballad \"Let’s Chill.\" Of course, as Uncle Charlie is quick to point out, Guy singer Aaron Hall listened to his share of Gap Band material before going into the vocal booth for the first time.\\n\\n\"We laugh about it,\" Wilson says. \"But, singers like R. Kelly and Aaron Hall continued in the tradition of what I was doing.\" Produced by Platinum Brothers and Larry \"Rock\" Campbell the tone of the \"Let’s Chill\" remake does not stray far from the original Teddy Riley joint-ski, Wilson provides enough flavors to make it even spicier. With a haunting quality to his voice, this is the kind of mood music that demands a red light bulb dangling over the waterbed.\\n\\nOn Charlie, Last Name Wilson a masterful performer returns to proclaim his rightful place on the throne. Mixing booming beats with chocolate love, Charlie Wilson is bringing the truth; and, as with most great soul singers, the gospel of life, love and happiness can be heard in the grain of his voice. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Wilson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Music defines Chase Bryant. At every level and in often unexpected ways, his truths are expressed in melody, lyrics, hooks and sounds ... but his reality goes even deeper than that. Bryant\\'s heritage is defined by music. His upbringing, his craft, his inspiration and his obsessions are all centered in the same - which is good - because there\\'s no other way to explain how a 23-year-old Texan could already be a top-flight guitar player, head-turning songwriter, RED BOW recording artist and co-producer of his debut album.\\n\\nBryant focuses his muse on the commonalities people share. \"We all have a destination,\" he says. \"We all have dreams we want to follow. I‚Äôm no different than anybody else, I just sing about it. It\\'s my job to put the party on and give people a good reason to have fun.\" And that he does, whether it\\'s in the soaring groove of \"Summertime Saturday High,\" the sparkling \"Fire,‚Äù unabashed romanticism of \"Change Your Name‚Äù or the vocally-charged, guitar-shredding debut single \"Take It On Back.\"\\n\\nRaised in Orange Grove, TX (pop. 1,200), Bryant\\'s grandfather played piano in Roy Orbison‚Äôs first two bands and, later, for Waylon Jennings. His uncles co-founded the group Ricochet, which had several hits in the \\'90s. \"From the time I was a kid, the only thing I wanted to do was play music,\" he says. \\n\\n\"I was two or three years old and heard Jerry Lee Lewis‚Äô \\'Lewis Boogie\\' come on my grandfather‚Äôs record player. I remember hearing him say, \\'My name is Jerry Lee Lewis and I‚Äôm from Louisiana\\' ... and I had an identity crisis! I thought I was Jerry Lee and would walk around saying that. In school, I was the odd kid. There were 20 guitars in town and I owned all of them.\"\\n\\nConway Twitty, Merle Haggard, Tom Petty, Vince Gill, Bob Wills, Steve Wariner, Bryan Adams and more were early influences, but a confluence of releases brought him to a turning point. \"Keith Urban\\'s Love, Pain & The Whole Crazy Thing and records by Sarah Buxton and Jedd Hughes did it,\" he says. \"I knew I wanted to play mainstream country ‚Äì I always knew. But those records told me that I could be that and still write guitar riffs that would stick in somebody‚Äôs head.\"\\n\\n\"I never wanted to be anybody else,\" he says. \"My grandfather always told me ‚Äòyou can\\'t be good at being anybody else. You can only be good at being yourself.‚Äô\"\\n\\nSongwriting was an integral part of his development. \"It goes back, of course, to getting my heart broken in school,\" he says. \"Some girl broke up with me ‚Äì¬†I may have been 11 or 12, and I just wrote it down. I was never great at reading, but I liked words, phrases and sentences. The only way I knew to let people know me is through writing. I\\'d just look at my life, grab some paper and put it down.\\n\\n\"The other thing I\\'d do is have melodies playing in my head. Something would pop up and I\\'d just go, \\'There it is.\\' \" Encouraged by his parents, particularly his school-teacher mother, he graduated early and moved west. \"All I wanted to do was play music and Los Angeles was my first attempt,\" Bryant says. \"Somebody asked me to go out there and write for this little company and I took the first flight. The dream was that simple, but you can\\'t stop before the miracle happens. You have to keep going. And I feel like it was a miracle just making it out of Orange Grove. I loved L.A., but Nashville is where I wanted to come. I probably wrote 400 lousy songs before I wrote my first good one. But one good one was enough to get Nashville managers, pluggers and publishers on board.\"\\n\\nBecause of his Roy Orbison connection, someone suggested a meeting with Roy\\'s widow, the late Barbara Orbison, a prominent Nashville publisher, who signed Bryant on the spot, making him her final signing before she passed. \\n\\nThat road led Bryant to BBR Music Group imprint Red Bow Records, to which he signed in August 2013. During one early meeting, Founder Benny Brown, notoriously picky about working with producers, surprised Bryant. \"He\\'d listen to my demos and say, \\'Where did you cut that?\\' or \\'Who produced that?\\' And I\\'d always say, \\'In my closet. Cut it myself. Played it myself.\\' Benny trusted me enough to co-produce with Derek George (Randy Houser, Joe Nichols). He gave me the reins, which was something I always wanted.\"\\n\\nBrown\\'s confidence was noteworthy if for no other reason than the fact that Bryant is completely self-taught as a producer. \"There were no studios in Orange Grove,\" Bryant explains. \"My parents took me to a Guitar Center and let me get what I needed. From there, I started building little tracks that I would listen to in the car and compare with what I heard on the radio. I taught myself how to make stuff sound bigger and better.‚Äù\\n\\nDespite being on the cusp of exceptional achievement for someone so young (having recently been named one of ‚ÄúThe Best Things We Saw at CMA Music Fest 2014‚Äù by Rolling Stone) Bryant sees little difference between himself and the audience. \"We\\'re all fans,\" he says. \"We\\'re all friends. And the music is our connection. To me, it\\'s a lifelong relationship and we\\'ll all get where we\\'re going together. That\\'s the beauty of music. This is the first chapter of my book, and I think people will find it defines where they\\'re at just as much as it defines where I\\'m at -- because we\\'re the same ‚Äì I\\'m just the guy with the guitar. If I wasn\\'t, I\\'d be the guy on the front row with his arm around his girl raising a glass to the guy onstage. No question. It\\'s just who I am. Music is everything.\"\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chase+Bryant\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He auditioned for Menudo, but was told that at the time that he was too young for the group. He didn\\'t give up and he heard that Titi Soto was trying to create a new group that would compete with Menudo, and so he went and tried out. He was chosen for the group and his meteoric rise to the top began.\\n\\nThat group, Los Chicos, made several #1 hits, including Puerto Rico Son Los Chicos, and Terremoto. And while it never achieved the popularity of Menudo, it did give Menudo good competition, becoming famous all over Latin America, participating in a movie (Coneccion Caribe), and producing millions of Los Chicos-related memorabilia like t-shirts, rulers, magazines etc.\\n\\nAfter Los Chicos went bankrupt in 1984 and separated, Chayanne, having become famous all over Latin America, retired for a little while, moving to Mexico and staying in the background for a few years, so his fans wouldn\\'t get tired of seeing him. In 1987, he came back like a storm, his first solo album producing the Spanish pop classic Fiesta En America. Chayanne was back. He became an instant pop idol all over Latin America again. He toured all over Latin America, and in 1989 he produced his second solo album, which produced another smash hit in Tu Pirata Soy Yo.\\n\\nThe 1990s brought some changes for Chayanne. He started acting, married Marilisa Maronese, with whom he formed a family, and moved to Miami.  He is well known for fiercely protecting the privacy of his wife and children.  His acting career has been extremely favorable.  Some of his roles include portraying himself in Volver A Empezar, playing a Cuban dancer along with Vanessa L. Williams in Hollywood\\'s Dance With Me, and a few soap operas in Argentina, including Provocame. \\n\\nHe has also kept on touring and producing CDs, and along with Ricky Martin, is considered to be Puerto Rico\\'s biggest pop idol ever. Songs such as Salomé, Torero, Boom Boom, Enamorado, Atado A Tu Amor, No Te Preocupes Por Mi, Caprichosa or Y Tú Te Vas are some of his greatest hits.\\n\\nIn 2006 he had a small role with famous singer and actress Natalia Oreiro in Sos Mi Vida (an Argentinian telenovela). Chayanne, today, having moved beyond teen idol, is a full-fledged Puerto Rican superstar. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chayanne\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Voiced by Isaac Hayes, Chef, as his nickname implied, worked as an elementary school cafeteria worker in the fictional town of South Park, Colorado. Generally portrayed as more level-headed than the other adult residents of the town, Chef\\'s guidance was often sought by the show\\'s core group of child protagonists – Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick – as he was usually the only adult they consistently trusted. To an inadvertent fault, he would frequently give inappropriate advice, usually in the non sequitur form of a lascivious soul song.\\n\\nChef was inspired by Hayes and other popular soul singers of the 1970s, as well as an actual dining hall worker encountered by series co-creator Trey Parker while he attended the University of Colorado. Chef played a less prominent role as the series progressed beyond its earlier seasons, and the character was killed off in the beginning of the tenth season in \"The Return of Chef\", in response to public controversy with Hayes, who left the show after the controversial episode \"Trapped in the Closet\", which satirized Scientology.\\n\\n\\'Chef Aid: The South Park Album\\' is an album based on the \\'Chef Aid\\' episode of South Park.

       " 'Corey Woods (born January 12, 1970), a.k.a. Raekwon (/ɹeɪˈkwɒn/), is an American rapper, one of the nine Wu-Tang Clan  members. Raekwon joined Wu-Tang Clan, a hip hop group based in Staten Island, New York in 1992. When the time came for him to release his first solo album, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... (1995), hip-hop, once again, underwent a momentous transformation. The album moves from track to track like a film moves from scene to scene. With its invigorating instrumentals and dramatic lyrical tales, Raekwon painted vivid pictures and presented powerful imagery through his enchanting verbal expression.\\n\\nRae\\'s groundbreaking debut album helped to bring the flavour of flossing to wax as well as the use of the moniker among Wu brethren and other prominent emcees. The single \"Verbal Intercourse\" featured the first appearance of Nas Escobar, Nas\\' alter ego. Similarly, Raekwon and Ghostface Killah, who served as Rae\\'s partner in rhyme throughout the entire Cuban Linx album, also developed a slew of other identities. Identities like Lex Diamond, one of the flashy, witty and intellectually stimulating personas of the multifaceted Raekwon.\\n\\nIn the years after the release of Cuban Linx, Raekwon continued to record several albums with the Clan including the platinum Wu-Tang Forver (1997) and The W (2000), as well as the gold Iron Flag (2001). He also starred in the critically acclaimed film Black and White, before releasing his second solo album, Immobilarity in 1999. Four years later, it\\'s time for another masterpiece from Raekwon.\\n\\nThe Lex Diamond Story, Raekwon\\'s forthcoming third solo album is that desperately needed effort. This new LP is as much a reflection of his first musical triumph Cuban Linx, as it is a manifestation of the future and what is to come from this great emcee. Raekwon is like the E.F. Hutton of hip-hop: when he speaks, everyone listens. The current void in hip-hop is filled with this rap veteran\\'s\\ncrafty verbal gymnastics and artistic form of storytelling. The Lex Diamond Story takes the top shelf elements of the Wu\\'s first album and the finest sentiments of Raekwon\\'s debut and joins them together to deliver another classic album to the masses.\\n\\nA lyrical gourmet meal, The Lex Diamond Story shows that The Chef still possesses the recipe to cook up a jambalaya of words with the main ingredient being superior skills. Animated and intense, Raekwon\\'s stealth delivery is filled with emotion, skilled cadence and an array of diverse stories, hooks, and topics. The track, \"All Over Again (The Way We Were)\" touches on the flavour of \"Can It Be All So Simple\" with its tale of street survival. Meanwhile, \"Pit Bull Fights\" is reminiscent of the ferocious lyrical beating inflicted on \"Incarcerated Scarfaces.\" Raekwon is indisputably at his creative beast. Unchained and uninhibited, he is assertive with his music and focused on his goals. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Raekwon\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album was a commercial failure, which Cetera has attributed to Warner Bros.\\' refusal to promote him as a solo artist out of fear that he would leave Chicago, who had only recently signed with the label.\\n\\nIn 1985, Cetera was interested in recording another solo album. He had stated his lack of interest for the extensive touring schedule of the band.

       " 'Cherrelle (born Cheryl Norton in Los Angeles, California in 1958) is a soul singer who rose to fame as one of the premier female R&B divas of the mid-to-late 1980s. Cousin of pop singer and TLC founder Perri \"Pebbles\" Reid, Cherrelle began her music career shortly after being discovered by Tabu Records founder Clarence Avant, who signed her to his label in 1983. Cherrelle got her name after her boss from a job hollered \"Cher-relle, you\\'re late again!\" In 1984, under the production of Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, she released her debut, \"Fragile\", which went gold, thanks to the Top Ten R&B single, \"I Didn\\'t Mean to Turn You On\". She released her best-selling album in 1985 with \"High Priority\", which featured the hits \"You Look Good to Me\", \"Will You Satisfy?\" and \"Artificial Heart\" and her seminal duet with Alexander O\\'Neal in the #2 single, \"Saturday Love\". In 1988, she released her third album, \"Affair\", which featured the #1 R&B single, \"Everything I Miss at Home\". On that strength, it was her third consecutive gold record. She released her last chart-topper with 1991\\'s \"More than a Woman\", which was a departure from her Jam & Lewis productions. She reunited with the producers eight years later with her album, \"The Right Time\", which was released in 1999. Since then, Cherrelle has been performing at venues in America and all over the world. Pop singers Robert Palmer and Mariah Carey have each covered her \"I Didn\\'t Mean to Turn You On\" while \"Saturday Love\" has been heralded as one of the greatest soul duets in history.\\n\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cherrelle\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Nat \"King\" Cole (March 17th 1919–February 15th  1965) was a popular American singer and jazz musician. \\n\\nAs a piano player, he formed a jazz trio in 1938 that played Los Angeles nightclubs, one of the first jazz trios featuring guitar and piano. Prior to this he had played music since he was a child and had worked with bands since he was sixteen. He was raised in Chicago and exposed to the abundant jazz scene there. He was heavily influenced by pianist Earl \"Fatha\" Hines.\\n\\nLater he became more popularly known as a singer and crooner and his work became more orchestrated.\\n\\nHis first mainstream vocal hit was in 1944 with Straighten Up and Fly Right, based on a black folk tale that his father had used as a theme for a sermon. Although hardly a rocker, the song\\'s success proved that an audience for folk-based material existed. It is considered a predecessor to the first rock and roll records. Indeed, Bo Diddley, who performed similar transformations of folk material, counted Cole as an influence.\\n\\nBeginning in the late 1940s, Cole began recording and performing more pop-oriented material for mainstream audiences, often accompanied by a string orchestra. His stature as a popular icon was cemented during this period with such hits as The Christmas Song (1946), Nature Boy (1948), Mona Lisa (1950), and his signature tune Unforgettable (1951). While this shift to pop music led some jazz critics and fans to accuse Cole of selling out, he never totally abandoned his musical roots; as late as 1956, for instance, he recorded an all-jazz album, After Midnight. In 1991, Mosaic Records released the Complete Nat King Cole Trio Recordings on Capitol, which contained 349 songs on twenty-seven LPs or eighteen CDs.\\n\\nThroughout the 1950s Cole continued to rack up hit after hit, including Smile, Pretend, A Blossom Fell, and If I May. Most of his pop hits were collaborations with famed arranger/conductor Nelson Riddle. It was with Riddle that Cole released his first ten-inch long-play album in 1953 entitled Sings for Two in Love. Several more albums followed, including the Gordon Jenkins arranged Love Is the Thing, which reached number one on the album charts in April 1957.\\n\\nInspired by a trip to Havana, Cuba in 1958, Nat went back there that same year and recorded Cole Espanol, an album sung entirely in Spanish and Portuguese. The album was a hit not only in the U.S., but in Latin America as well. The album was so popular, that two others followed: A mis amigos in 1959, and More Cole Espanol in 1962.\\n\\nMusical tastes were changing in the late 1950s, and despite a successful stab at rock n\\' roll with Send for Me, Cole\\'s ballad singing had grown old to younger listeners. Like contemporaries Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, Nat found that the pop singles chart had been almost entirely taken over by youth oriented acts. In 1960, Nat\\'s longtime collaborator Nelson Riddle, left Capitol Records for Frank Sinatra\\'s newly formed Reprise Records label. The two parted ways with one final hit album Wild Is Love, based on lyrics by Ray Rasch and Dotty Wayne. Nat would later re-tool the concept album into an off-Broadway production called I\\'m With You.\\n\\nAs the 1960s progressed, Nat once again found success on the American singles chart, starting with the country/pop flavored hit Ramblin\\' Rose in August of 1962. Three more hit singles followed: Dear Lonely Hearts, Those Lazy, Hazy, Crazy Days of Summer, and That Sunday, That Summer. Nat\\'s final album was entitled L.O.V.E, and was recorded in late 1964. It was released just prior to his death and reached number four on the Billboard Albums chart in the spring of 1965. A \"Best Of\" album went gold in 1968. His 1957 song When I Fall in Love was a chart topping hit for the U.K. in 1987.\\n\\nCole was the first African-American to have his own radio program. He repeated that success in the late-1950s with the first truly national television show starring an African-American. In both cases, the programs were ultimately canceled because sponsors shied away from a black artist. Cole fought racism all his life, refusing to perform in segregated venues. In 1956, he was attacked on stage in Birmingham, Alabama by members of the White Citizens\\' Council who apparently were attempting to kidnap him. Despite injuries, Cole completed the show but vowed never to perform in the South again.\\n\\nOn 23rd August 1956, Cole spoke at the Republican National Convention in the Cow Palace, San Francisco, California. He was also present at the Democratic National Convention in 1960, to throw his support behind President John F. Kennedy. Cole was also among the dozens of entertainers recruited by Frank Sinatra to perform at the Kennedy Inaugural gala in 1961. Nat King Cole frequently consulted with President Kennedy (and later President Johnson) on the issue of civil rights. Yet he was dogged by critics, who felt he shied away from controversy when it came to the civil rights issue. Among the most notable was Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, who was upset that Cole didn\\'t take stronger action after the 1956 on-stage attack.\\n\\nIn 1948, Cole purchased a house in the all-white Hancock Park neighborhood in Los Angeles, California. The property owners association told Cole they didn\\'t want any undesirables moving in, to which Cole retorted \"Neither do I. And if I see anybody undesirable coming in here, I\\'ll be the first to complain.\"\\n\\nHe and his second wife, Maria Ellington, were married in Harlem\\'s Abyssinian Baptist Church by Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. They had five children, including twin girls. Daughter Carol Cole, and son Kelly Cole were adopted. Kelly Cole died in 1995. Nat\\'s daughter, Natalie Cole, and his younger brother, Freddie Cole are also singers.\\n\\nNatalie and her father had an unexpected hit in the summer of 1991. The younger Cole mixed a 1961 recording of her father\\'s rendition of Unforgettable with her own voice, creating an electronic duet. Both the song and the album of the same name won several Grammy awards the following year.\\n\\nCole performed in many short films, and played W. C. Handy in the film Saint Louis Blues. He also appeared in The Nat King Cole Story, China Gate, and The Blue Gardenia.\\n\\nNat King Cole was a heavy smoker of Kool menthol cigarettes, believing that smoking up to three packs a day gave his voice the rich sound it had (Cole would smoke several cigarettes in rapid succession before a recording for this very purpose). Cole died of lung cancer at St. John\\'s Hospital in Santa Monica, California, on 15th February 1965. His funeral was held at St. Victor\\'s Catholic Church in West Hollywood, and he was buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

       " 'Cheryl Lynn was born in Los Angeles on March 11, 1957. Her professional singing career started in 1976 when she landed a job as a backing singer in the national touring company of The Wiz. Eventually she would land the role of Evillene, the Wicked Witch of the West, during the six month national tour run.\\n\\nPrior to her appearance on The Wiz, Cheryl taped an episode of the Gong Show in the early part of 1976. She went on to win the competition while singing Joe Cocker\\'s \"You Are So Beautiful.\" Lynn later told Dick Clark during her appearance on American Bandstand that after the episode aired, in the fall of 1976, record industry executives were calling about her soon after the win.\\n\\nSuccess and later career\\nAfter signing with Columbia Records, Lynn released her first and biggest hit, \"Got to Be Real,\" which was penned by Toto\\'s keyboardist David Paich, David Foster and Lynn. The song peaked at #12 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and #1 on the R&B chart. The success of the single prompted a full scale debut album. Titled, Cheryl Lynn, it was produced by Paich. The album sold over a million copies and peaked at #5 on Billboard\\'s R&B albums chart and #23 on Billboard\\'s top 200 album charts. The follow-up single, \"Star Love,\" also became a hit —reaching the top twenty on both the R&B and Dance charts.\\n\\nDuring Cheryl\\'s debut album\\'s run, members of the rock group Toto were putting together their debut album. During the production Lynn was asked to provided the female backing vocal on the single, \"Georgy Porgy.\" The single peaked at #48 on Billboard\\'s Pop charts. Although Toto would go on to chart more than a dozen pop hits throughout the years, it was Lynn\\'s vocal on \"Georgy Porgy\" that aided the group in charting their one and only R&B (#18) and Dance (#80) hit on the Billboard charts.\\n\\nIn 1981, Ray Parker, Jr. produced \"Shake It Up Tonight,\" a major club R&B hit from Lynn\\'s third album, In The Night. The following year, Luther Vandross was called on to produced Cheryl\\'s fourth album, Instant Love. The second single off the album, \"If This World Were Mine\" —a 1982 duet with Luther Vandross that covered a Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell song, has become an urban contemporary classic. For her fifth album, Preppie, Cheryl took it upon herself to produce most of the tracks with the exception of the single \"Encore\" (#1 R&B hit) —written and produced by the Minneapolis funk duo, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. It became Lynn\\'s second #1 single on the U.S. Billboard R&B Charts. Her final top ten hit in the 80s was released in 1989: \"Every Time I Try To Say Goodbye,\" from her eighth album, Whatever It Takes.\\n\\nThe 1990\\'s\\nCheryl began the 90\\'s without a record contract. During this period she did session work on Richard Marx albums Rush Street and Paid Vacation. She also worked with Luther Vandross on his album Your Secret Love . In 1995, after a six year hiatus from recording her own material, Lynn teamed up with producer/songwriter Teddy Riley, (formally of the New Jack Swing group Guy), to record her ninth album, Good Time. It was released in Japan, the UK and later in the United States as an imported CD and featured the club favorite single \"Guarantee For My Heart.\" \\n\\n2000 to present\\nDuring the new millennium Lynn toured Japan and did the occasional gig in the U.S., performing at charity events in her hometown of Los Angeles. She performed on ABC\\'s The Disco Ball... A 30-Year Celebration, which aired in January 2003. In 2004 she recorded the song, \"Sweet Kind Of Life,\" which was also written and produced by Jam & Lewis, for the animated film and soundtrack to Shark Tale.\\n\\nOn September 19, 2005, Lynn\\'s signature song \"Got to Be Real\" was inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame. She is considered an influence on some of today\\'s R&B female singers, including Mary J. Blige, who, along with Will Smith, covered Lynn\\'s signature song, \"Got to Be Real\", also for the soundtrack of the animated film Shark Tale.\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cheryl+Lynn\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The genesis of \"Thanks for My Child\" began with Full Force member Bowlegged Lou\\'s experience with the complications of his wife\\'s first pregnancy.\\n\\nAs pivotal as \"Thanks for My Child\" was for Riley\\'s career, it was not the first song Lou offered to her. She refused his offer to record \"I Wonder If I Take You Home\" because she did not want to spread herself too thin, but after it became a million-selling hit for Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam in 1985, she thought she had missed her big break. She considered herself \"the biggest loser ever\". Then Lou offered her \"Thanks for My Child\". Riley still had her nurse\\'s job when the song went to number one on the R&B chart.\\n\\n\"Thanks for My Child\" spent just one week on the UK charts at #75. As this is the shortest time it is possible to spend in the charts at the lowest possible position to be considered a \"hit\", the Guiness Book of Hit Singles lists Riley as one of the UK\\'s least successful chart acts.\\n\\nThe title track single to her debut LP Me Myself and I made it to number 18 on the R&B charts in early 1989. Another single, \"Every Little Thing About You,\" peaked at number 55 on the R&B charts later that year. Her second LP, Chapters, was issued and yielded the singles \"How Can You Hurt the One You Love\" and a cover of Aretha Franklin\\'s 1968 hit \"Ain\\'t No Way\". Her third album All That! was released by Reprise, and featured the singles \"Gimme\" and \"Guess I\\'m in Love.\"\\n\\nAfter a hiatus from the entertainment industry, Riley re-emerged in the early 2000s as a star in a number of gospel plays for best-selling playwright Tyler Perry, including Madea\\'s Class Reunion, Madea Goes to Jail, Why Did I Get Married?, and the film version of Diary of a Mad Black Woman.

       " 'Chevelle Franklyn has emerged on the gospel music scene as one of the most outstanding Ministers of Music over the past nine years. Her energy as a performer, insight as a songwriter/producer, vocal capacity as a singer, and her anointing as a worshiper has ensured her success as a leading, international, multiple award-winning Psalmist.\\n\\nAs a child prodigy in the industry, Chevelle recorded her first single – “Here I Am” produced by Rohan Harrison –and it was released in her early teens. Public reaction to its debut was incredibly positive and indicated that Chevelle had a future in the industry.\\n\\nNurtured by some of the top names among Jamaica’s music producers, Chevelle soon marked out a distinctive territory in Jamaica’s dancehall culture scene. Her future took a rosy turn when she began working with producers Mikey Bennett and Rohan Harrison. She recorded her smash hit “Nice and Naughty”, followed by another single, “No Pushover” in 1992..., again produced by Mikey Bennett.\\n\\nThis led to collaborations with household names such as Shabba Ranks “Mr. Lover Man” in 1991. In 1997, Chevelle hit a lucrative opportunity to record the internationally acclaimed “Dancehall Queen” with Beenie Man, for Island Records of which the soundtrack was used for the equally successful movie of the same name.\\n\\nChevelle was now a household name in Jamaica, the UK, the Caribbean and America. During 1996 and 1997, she toured the major cities of these countries, performing at venues such as New York Apollo and Reggae Sumfest Jamaica.\\nBut despite the great success, there remained a gaping hole in her soul. In 1998, during a concert, Chevelle, tired of the empty way of life and hopelessness, suddenly declared on stage a change of direction in her career and lifestyle – she decided to become a Christian. As a symbol of her signature to this new change, she sang Kirk Franklin’s song, “Silver and Gold” on stage. She said, “I did not hear a message or anything, but I felt the calling of God. I just broke down on the stage and said, ‘I can’t do this anymore.’ I knew there was something better out there.” Chevelle gave her life to the Lord ending all her secular contractual agreements, walking away from international hit song “Dancehall Queen.”\\n\\nBetter certainly did come and since that change Chevelle has been combining her new expression with the energetic lyrical style that had made her a great success. A collaboration with Papa San, in 2000, on his award-winning album, Victory, led to a Marlin Award for her vocal appearance on the track Touch from you. She wrote the first page in the history of her new lifestyle with her first gospel album, “Joy”- a co-production effort with Danny Brownie, for Mainstreet Records. The album stirred up an international storm when it was released in 2001, and led to a tour around the UK, the Caribbean and the USA.\\n\\nOne of her aims in its recording, Joy, was to deal with real issues facing young people. She said, “Songs like ‘It’s Another Saturday Night,’ deal with real issues for young Christian people. It’s a real struggle – sometimes your friends are out partying and you feel left out, so this is what the song is dealing with.”\\n\\n\\nFor her efforts, “Joy” led to 12 nominations in the Sixth Annual Caribbean Gospel Music Marlin Awards, in 2002. Chevelle walked away with awards in five categories-Outstanding New Artist of the Year; Adapted Recording of the Year, for “Firm Foundation”; Female Reggae Recording of the Year, for “Magnify His Name”; Contemporary Female Vocal Performance of the Year, for “Joy”; and Album of the Year, also for Joy.\\n\\nChevelle’s Spiritual covering is Bishop John Francis of Ruach Ministries, London and her spiritual mother is Pastor Enid Stewart. She has seen God use the ministry to empower and equipped her for Music Ministry. In 2004, Chevelle ministered at The International Gathering of Champions’ 04, hosted by Pastor Matthew Ashimolowo, Senior Pastor, Kingsway International Christian Centre – London. She shared the platform with, Dr Ron Kenoly, and the KICC Mass Choir along with prominent speakers such as Bishop Eddie Long, Bishop T. D. Jakes, Bishop David Oyedepo, Dr. Mike Murdock, Bishop David Oyedepo, Pastor Robb,Thompson, Bishop Keith Butler, Dr Mensah Otabil, Prophetess Juanita Bynum, and Dr. Morris Cerullo... “Chevelle Franklyn has ministered several times at KICC.

       " 'Chicane is an electronic music act, and the guise of British musician, composer and record producer Nicholas Bracegirdle. He was born on February 28th 1971, in Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire.\\n\\nChicane is known for the singles \"Offshore\", an Ibiza dance anthem included in many compilations in both chill-out and dance versions; \"Saltwater\", which featured vocals by Clannad member Máire Brennan and is one of the most well-known and popular singles of the trance genre; and the UK number-one hit \"Don\\'t Give Up\", featuring vocals by Bryan Adams, which became a top ten hit on singles charts across Europe.\\n\\nFar from the Maddening Crowds, Chicane\\'s debut album, is still considered a seminal release among the trance music community, while the second album, Behind the Sun, was certified gold in the UK. In 2007, after the hindrance of an ultimately unreleased album in the intervening time, Somersault was released on Bracegirdle\\'s independent record label followed shortly after by a re-release of Far From The Maddening Crowds which included a new mix of Offshore (Offshore 2007)\\n\\nIn addition, Bracegirdle also worked under the aliases Disco Citizens, producing a handful of less radio-friendly, vocal-less tracks with a stronger progressive house sound. Working with singer Vanessa St. James and producer Mr. Joshua, Bracegirdle was part of the Mr. Joshua Presents Espiritu project, known for the song \"In Praise of the Sun\", released with both English and French vocals. Nick has also gone by the name \"Rebel Transcanner\" to produce a remix of Tomski\\'s \"14 Hours To Save The Earth.\" Nick Bracegirdle has also used the alias Sitvac to produce a one-time single, \"Wishful Thinking.\"\\n\\nWhile having trained in classical guitar and piano at an early age, Bracegirdle\\'s earliest influences in electronic music came from melodic composers such as Jean Michel Jarre and Vangelis, and synthpop pioneer Vince Clarke; a further influence was the dance hit \"Anthem\" by the house music group N-Joi. all this convinced him to pursue the creation of melodic dance music, and by the age of 12 he was making music in recording studios and sending demos to record labels.\\n\\nEventually, Bracegirdle founded his own record label, Modena Records, which holds the rights to all his songs and licenses them to other labels for release and distribution. A partnership with Leo Elstob produced the first Disco Citizens single, \"Right Here Right Now\", in 1995, as well as the first Chicane single, \"Offshore\", in 1996. \"Offshore\" would be the first of Chicane\\'s many releases on independent UK dance music record label Xtravaganza Recordings, then-newly founded by DJ and Bracegirdle\\'s college friend Alex Gold. It reached #12 on the UK Singles Chart (and #1 on other UK-based charts compiled by Mixmag, Record Mirror, and others), the top 40 in multiple European countries, and #5 on the US Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts in 1997 upon re-release. Its inclusion on numerous Ibiza-themed trance music compilation albums (such as Café del Mar) attest to its popularity in the nightclubs on the island, one of the worldwide epicenters of dance music.\\n\\n\\'Sunstroke\\', the follow-up single, attained similar popularity and chart numbers. A third single, \"Offshore \\'97\" (a separate item from the re-release of \"Offshore\") was actually a mashup of \"Offshore\" with the vocal track from the Power Circle song \"A Little Love, a Little Life\", mixed by producer and DJ Anthony Pappa. Originally a bootleg, it was turned into an official release, credited to \"Chicane with Power Circle\".\\n\\nFollowing these releases, the first Chicane album, Far from the Maddening Crowds, which included new songs and multiple versions of the previously-released singles, was released in September 1997. Additional singles that followed were \"Lost You Somewhere\", the Benelux release \"Red Skies\", and the non-album single \"Strong in Love\", for which Bracegirdle used vocals by British singer Sylvia Mason-James (after discovering that she was the vocalist on the Paul Oakenfold/Steve Osborne remix of \"Lemon\" by U2) and first collaborated on production with Ray \"Madman\" Hedges (producer for B*Witched and Boyzone).\\n\\n1999 saw the release of \"Saltwater\", a song based on Máire Brennan\\'s vocals from \"Theme from Harry\\'s Game\" by the Celtic band Clannad. This song was also used on one of the Belfast City advertisements broadcast in 2005-2006 across regional channels. The version of the vocals used in \"Saltwater\", however, was a new recording by Brennan herself. It surpassed all previous Chicane singles, reaching #6 on the UK charts and #1 on all five major UK dance charts.\\n\\nAfter producing a radio remix of Bryan Adams\\'s \"Cloud Number Nine\", Bracegirdle offered Adams the vocal position on the song \"Don\\'t Give Up\". The vocals Adams recorded were subsequently heavily processed through a vocoder so as to play down his rock music vocal style; in fact, the vocal credit was initially not publicized when the single was sent to Pete Tong\\'s BBC Radio 1 program Essential Selection. On the show, Tong made the song his first \"Essential New Tune\" selection of the new millennium. It was also Chicane\\'s biggest hit, debuting at #1 on the UK charts (and notably replacing \"American Pie\", Madonna\\'s #1 single of the previous week), reached #3 on the US dance chart and #1 on Australian and Russian charts, and made other charts across Europe as well.\\n\\nThe subsequent album Behind the Sun was certified gold by the BPI, while \"Don\\'t Give Up\" was certified silver. Two other singles were released off the album—the double A-side \"Halcyon\" / \"No Ordinary Morning\" and a dramatically remixed version of \"Autumn Tactics\"—but neither was as successful as the preceding releases.\\n\\nIn 2002, Bracegirdle co-wrote two songs on Cher\\'s album Living Proof, including \"Alive Again\", which was released as a single in Europe only. The 2002 edition of the Formula One video game included the songs \"Sunstroke\", \"The Drive Home\", and a remix of \"Nagasaki Badger\".\\n\\nFor the next two years, Bracegirdle became engaged in a lawsuit with Xtravaganza, which ended in Chicane\\'s departure from the label and its signing with WEA for the release of a third album, Easy to Assemble. Originally scheduled for 2003, the album\\'s release was preceded by the lead single \"Love on the Run\", followed by a promotional single, \"Locking Down\". After promotional copies of the album were distributed, however, Easy to Assemble was not commercially released as expected—though over the following year, the official Chicane website was periodically updated with messages announcing further delays towards a still-expected release.\\n\\nMore recently, biographies, interviews, and publicity have stated that the album\\'s release was outright prevented due to an Internet leak and bootlegging of the promotional album. It was also revealed that Bracegirdle had left Warner following its 2003 sale to Edgar Bronfman, Jr. and was planning an independent release at the time.\\n\\nEventually, April 2006 saw the release of a new single, \"Stoned in Love\", on Globe Records through Universal Music Group, featuring singer Tom Jones on vocals. (Press Release). At the time of the announcement the song was also played twice by Pete Tong. \\n\\nThe track received substantial UK TV promotion in the run up to the week of release, featuring utterly live performances on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, The New Paul O\\'Grady Show and a semi-live performance on BBC\\'s now defunct Top of the Pops. Jones and Bracegirdle were also interviewed on Channel 5 News; When asked in the 5 News interview where he had been since \"Don\\'t Give Up\", Bracegirdle replied that he had been \"basically stuffed\" by the internet bootlegging of the album Easy to Assemble.\\n\\nIn February 2007, Chicane departed from Universal as well; according to the official website, all new material will now be released through Modena itself. The follow-up single \"Come Tomorrow\" was released on 16 July 2007, followed by the fourth album, Somersault, a week later on 23 July 2007. Bracegirdle has entirely self-financed these initial independent releases, as well as subsequent live performances. On 4 May 2007, the Cicada remix of \"Come Tomorrow\" was played on Radio 1 by Pete Tong.\\n\\nOn 25 August 2008 Chicane released \"Bruised Water\" with Natasha Bedingfield. Promotional copies of the track were made available, with remixes from Mischa Daniels and Adam K. Following the leak of his 2003 album, Chicane now employs Web Sheriff in order to prevent links to pirated material, such as this single and other tracks from his upcoming album, from being posted on various blogs and websites. In October 2008, Chicane released a new Best Of compilation, which features all their hits, along with a new track called Wake Up, which is a collaboration with Keane.\\n\\nChicane\\'s fourth studio album \"Giants\" is set to be released on August 1 2010 (September 7 2010 in The Netherlands). The first official single off the album will be \"Middledistancerunner\" featuring Adam Young. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chicane\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'There are at least five artists with this name;\\n\\n1) John Towner Williams (born February 8, 1932) is an American composer, conductor, and pianist. With a career spanning over six decades, he has composed some of the most popular, recognizable, and critically acclaimed film scores in cinematic history, including those of the Star Wars series, Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Superman, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, the Indiana Jones series, the first two Home Alone films, Hook, the first two Jurassic Park films, Schindler\\'s List, and the first three Harry Potter films. \\n\\nWilliams has been associated with director Steven Spielberg since 1974, composing music for all but three of his feature films. Other works by Williams include theme music for the 1984 Summer Olympic Games, NBC Sunday Night Football, \"The Mission\" theme used by NBC News and Seven News in Australia, the television series Lost in Space and Land of the Giants, and the incidental music for the first season of Gilligan\\'s Island. Williams has also composed numerous classical concertos and other works for orchestral ensembles and solo instruments. He served as the Boston Pops\\'s principal conductor from 1980 to 1993, and is currently the orchestra\\'s laureate conductor.\\n\\nWilliams has won 24 Grammy Awards, seven British Academy Film Awards, five Academy Awards, and four Golden Globe Awards. With 51 Academy Award nominations, Williams is the second most-nominated individual, after Walt Disney. In 2005, the American Film Institute selected Williams\\'s score to 1977\\'s Star Wars as the greatest American film score of all time. The soundtrack to Star Wars was additionally preserved by the Library of Congress into the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Williams was inducted into the Hollywood Bowl\\'s Hall of Fame in 2000, and was a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors in 2004 and the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2016. Williams composed the score for eight of the top 20 highest-grossing films at the U.S. box office (adjusted for inflation).\\n\\nJohn Towner Williams was born on February 8, 1932 in Floral Park, New York, to Esther (née Towner) and Johnny Williams, a jazz percussionist who played with the Raymond Scott Quintet. Williams has said of his lineage, \"My father was a Maine man—we were very close. My mother was from Boston. My father\\'s parents ran a department store in Bangor, Maine, and my mother\\'s father was a cabinetmaker. [...] People with those roots are not inclined to be lazy.\"\\n\\nWilliams married Barbara Ruick, an American actress and singer, in 1956. Together they had three children: Jennifer (b. 1956), Mark Towner Williams (b. 1958), and Joseph (b. 1960), who is the lead singer of Toto. The two remained married until her death in 1974. In 1980, Williams married Samantha Winslow, a photographer.\\n\\n2) John Christopher Williams is a classical guitar player.\\n\\nBorn in Melbourne, Australia, on 24 April 1941, to an English father (Len Williams) and an Australian-Chinese mother, Williams was taught initially by his father. At the age of twelve he went to Italy to study under \"The Maestro,\" Andrés Segovia. Later, he attended the Royal College of Music in London, studying piano because the school did not have a guitar department at the time. Upon graduation, he was offered the opportunity to create such a department. He seized the opportunity and ran it for the first two years. Williams has maintained links with the College (and with the Northern College in Manchester) ever since.\\n\\nWilliams is best known as a classical guitarist, but has explored many different musical traditions. He has collaborated with Julian Bream and Paco Peña and was a member of the fusion group Sky. He is also a composer and arranger.\\n\\nWilliams has commissioned guitar concertos from composers such as Stephen Dodgson, André Previn, Patrick Gowers, Richard Harvey, and Steve Gray. He has also worked with composers from his native Australia, including Phillip Houghton, Peter Sculthorpe, Ross Edwards (composer), and Nigel Westlake, to produce guitar works that capture the spirit of his homeland.\\n\\nHe enjoyed a worldwide hit single with his recording of Cavatina by Stanley Myers, used as the theme tune to the Oscar-winning film The Deer Hunter (1979). The piece had originally been written for piano, for another film ten years earlier, The Walking Stick (1970) but re-written for guitar and expanded by Myers at Williams\\' invitation. In 1973, Cleo Laine wrote lyrics and recorded the song \"He Was Beautiful\" accompanied by John Williams. A year later, it was a top-five UK hit single for Iris Williams (no relation).\\n\\nAt the invitation of producer Martin Lewis he created a highly acclaimed classical-rock fusion duet with celebrated rock guitarist Pete Townshend of Townshend\\'s anthemic \"Won\\'t Get Fooled Again\" for the 1979 Amnesty International benefit show The Secret Policeman\\'s Ball. The duet was featured on the resulting album and the film version of the show – bringing Williams to the broader attention of the rock audience.\\n\\nThe relationship with Lewis led to Williams\\' classical-rock fusion band Sky being invited to give the first-ever rock concert to be held at Westminster Abbey – a benefit concert for Amnesty that Lewis produced in February 1981.\\n\\nHe is visiting professor at the Royal Academy of Music, London.\\n\\nWilliams and his artist wife Kathy Panama reside in London and Australia.\\n\\n3) John Williams \\n\\nJohn Williams is internationally regarded as one of the foremost players of Irish music today. With five All-Ireland titles to his credit, John is the only American-born competitor ever to win first place in the \"senior concertina\" category. His additional talents on flute, button accordion, bodhran, and piano distinguish him as a much sought after multi-instrumentalist in the acoustic scene around the world.\\n\\nBorn and raised on the Southwest Side of Chicago, John spent his summers during college on the Southwest coast of Ireland in his father’s village of Doolin, Co. Clare. Like Chicago, Doolin became a major musical crossroads for John and countless other local and international musicians to meet and exchange music. Gigging every night in the pubs of Doolin and Lisdoonvarna soon led to performances in Galway, Cork, Dublin, Belfast, Paris, Britanny, Zurich, and New York City (bio http://www.johnwilliamsmusic.com/bio.htm).\\n\\n 3) John Williams \\n\\nA blues/jazz guitarist in Seattle, Washington, whose music is available at Magnatune.com (bio http://magnatune.com/artists/john_williams).\\n\\n 3) John Knowles Williams \\n\\nAn experimental/indie musician.

After serving in the US Marine Corps for three years he returned to California and formed the rap group 213 with his cousin Snoop Dogg and friend Warren G. He was soon signed to Death Row Records along with Snoop, and he made his debut on Dr. Dre\\'s 1992 album The Chronic. Singing in what would later become his trademark style, he was well-received by fans and critics alike, and in 1994 he produced his first hit single \"Regulate\" with Warren G. Nate Dogg released his debut album under Breakaway Records in 1998 after a tumultuous time at Death Row Records. The double album was titled G-Funk Classics Vol. 1 & 2 and was followed up in 2001 with Music & Me on Elektra Records, 2002\\'s Essentials and 2003\\'s Nate Dogg.

She was born in Tokyo on February 15th, 1978. Her real name is Masako, but she was given the nickname \"Chocolat\" in high school(inspired by the name of Princess Masako\\'s dog), and decided to use it as her alias. She made her debut with the release \"Chocolat a la mode\" in 1997, and since that time she has released several albums and singles, collaborating on them with artists such as Rei Harakami, カジヒデキ, SUPERCAR, キリンジ, Neil & Iraiza, and Citrus. In 2005 she began recording albums with her husband Akito Katayose(of Great 3) under the name Chocolat & Akito.\\n\\n2-Chocolat is a francophone psychedelic pop band from Montreal.\\n\\nAs the feral child of the Montreal indie music scene, Chocolat forgo pretension for passion, with their dirty, retro futuristic mix of psychedelic garage and bluesy, folk-rock. Dylanesque crooning glides over frenzied riffs, serpentine basslines, greasy organs and pounding drums.  Chocolat brings together musicians of both notoriety and pedigree from Montreal\\'s rock \\'n\\' roll community, including Jimmy Hunt on vocals, harmonica and guitar, Martin Chouinard on piano, Dale Macdonald (Cockroaches, Red Mass) on guitar, Ysael Pepin (Demon’s Claws) on bass and Brian Hilderbrand (Demon’s Claws) on drums.\\n\\nHaving released their first full-length album Piano Élégant in early 2008 with Grosse Boite Records, they are now working on new songs as well as planning to re-release their first self-titled EP \"Chocolat\" with Semprini Records.  \\n\\n3- Chocolat (Hangul: 쇼콜라), commonly stylized as ChoColat, is a South Korean girl group created by Paramount Music in 2011. \\n\\nTheir group name means \"Chocolate\" in French. Their name was chosen because the different characters of the members would remind people of different types of chocolate. However, due to there already being a group with the name Chocolate, the French translation was chosen as their group name to set themselves apart from that unit.[1] The group consists of five members: three are mixed race Korean, (Juliane, Tia, Melanie), and the other two are Korean (Min Soa, Jae Yoon). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chocolat\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Chris Andrews (born Christopher Frederick Andrews in Romford on 15 October 1942) is an English-German singer-songwriter whose musical career started in the late 1950s. He is probably now best known for his big hit, \"Yesterday Man\". He was also the songwriter responsible for many of Sandie Shaw\\'s most successful recordings. Because of the Brexit vote, Andrews obtained German citizenship in 2016. \\n\\nHe had become an enthusiast of rock and roll while still in his teens. He formed his own group \"Chris Ravel & The Ravers\" and even recorded later in that guise . Iit was in the clubs of Hamburg as a rock and roller that he cut his musical teeth- just like the Beatles and the many others in the vanguard of Britain\\'s beat boom. Perhaps it was this German influence that gave his later music such a distinctive sound. Despite this hard work, he remained in relative obscurity until a song he had written, \"The First Time\" was taken up by Adam Faith. The song proved an important turning point for Adam whose musical fortunes had begun to decline with the coming of Merseybeat. The song gave him a new sound and his flagging chart career a much needed boost. It was also a turning point for Chris because a new singer- Sandie Shaw, also managed by Adam Faith\\'s manager, Eve Taylor, needed songs. Chris produced a long series of numbers- most of which suited Sandie very well- either despite, or because of, the fact that their distinctive backing generally seemed to be more suited to a Munich \"Oktoberfest\" than a UK pop song. The best of these included \"Girl Don\\'t Come\", \"Long Live Love\", and \"Tomorrow\". In any event, the Shaw-Andrews combination proved so successful one might have imagined that Chris would abandon his own singing career in order to concentrate on songwriting. Fortunately, this was not the case.\\n\\nOne song that Chris produced was unsuitable for Sandie but proved ideal for him to launch his own successful run on the UK singles chart. \"Yesterday Man\" enjoyed a lot of airplay and although not quite reaching the top in the UK it proved to be popular throughout most of Europe and sold extremely well in a number of countries. Chris managed to follow this inital huge success with another UK top twenty entry. Results for his self penned recordings beyond this were disappointing in the UK, but his work was much more appreciated on the continent where he would spend a lot of the 1970s. Although he tried to kick start his UK recording career again at the end of the 1970s with the help of his old friend Adam Faith (who had himself taken up management through his work with Leo Sayer). However, his -perhaps unexpected- success with \"Yesterday Man\" remains the pinnacle of this talented singer/ songwriter\\'s career. \\n\\nIn South Africa, his later single releases proved particularly popular,[13] with \"Pretty Belinda\" (1969), \"Carol OK\" and \"Brown Eyes\" (both 1970) all topping the charts there. \"Yo Yo\" reached No. 7 at the end of 1970.\\n\\nAndrews remains active in his career as a singer-songwriter, working primarily in continental Europe and in the United Kingdom.

       " 'Jhené Aiko Efuru Chilombo (born March 16, 1988), better known as Jhené Aiko or simply Jhené, is an American singer-songwriter and recording artist from Los Angeles, California. Formerly signed to The Ultimate Group and Epic Records, she left both labels in order to continue her education. Aiko began her career being known as \"Lil\\' Fizz\\'s cousin\", however she is not actually related to him. It was used as a marketing tool suggested by Sony and Epic to promote her through the R&B group B2K and attract an audience, though Aiko affirms that she and Lil\\' Fizz grew up together and were close like family.\\n\\nOn December 16, 2011, Aiko signed a recording contract with American record producer No I.D.\\'s record label Artium, distributed through Def Jam Recordings. She has been described as having gentle and pop-tinged vocals. [Tyler Antonius]\\n\\nJhené Aiko was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of Christina Yamamoto and Dr. Karamo Chilombo (birth name Greg Barnes), a pediatrician. She is of mixed race background—her mother is of Japanese, Spanish, and Dominican descent, while her father is of African American, Yaqui, Choctaw, Cherokee, Navajo, and German Jewish descent. She often states her ethnicity as \"Japanese, African American, Native American, etc.\" based on percentages but identifies with all parts of her heritage. Aiko has also stated that she has French ancestry and has stated regarding her ancestry, \"I’m a quarter Japanese. That’s the only percentage I know for sure because it’s my grandfather\\'s. And then everyone else is pretty much like mixed.\" Her older sisters Miyoko and Jamila were in the R&B group Gyrl and toured with Immature, who were signed to MCA/Silas Records. This led to Jhené’s first meeting with producer Chris Stokes when she was five years old, and eventually he heard her sing. When B2K signed with Epic Records, Jhené was signed as well. She served as the opening act for B2K on their Scream Tour 3.\\n\\nAiko began her musical career contributing vocals to several B2K releases in 2002. She featured on tracks five through eight of the R&B group\\'s remix album B2K: The Remixes - Volume 1. \"Santa Baby\", a cover she recorded, was also featured on their album Santa Hooked Me Up and she appeared as a guest vocalist on the song \"Tease\" from Pandemonium!. Her song \"Dog\" appeared as a bonus track.\\n\\nAiko also appeared in numerous music videos including O\\'Ryan\\'s debut video, \"Take It Slow\", B2K\\'s debut video \"Uh Huh\" and \"Why I Love You\", P.Y.T.\\'s \"Same Ol\\' Same Ol\\' (Remix)\" featuring Sarai, Play\\'s \"M.A.S.T.E.R. (Part 2)\" featuring Lil\\' Fizz video and Morgan Smith\\'s 2004 video \"Blow Ya Whistle\". Jhené also has songs featured on the soundtracks of Barbershop, The Master of Disguise, You Got Served, The Proud Family, and Byou. She released a video for her single \"NO L.O.V.E\" (re-recorded from Tha\\' Rayne version in 2002) which debuted on BET\\'s 106 & Park when she was 15 years old.\\n\\nAiko was set to release her debut album, then-titled My Name Is Jhené, however the album was never released due to tension at the record label Epic, which ultimately led to Aiko asking to be released from the label. She then began to focus on school and continue her education.\\n\\nIn 2007, she made a return to music, in an interview she spoke on the choice saying “Shortly before I conceived my daughter, I stepped back into the field and took a meeting with a label head. In this meeting, I was innocently told, to ‘sell’ myself when walking into these meetings. “That’s when I decided I would ‘sail’ myself rather than sell myself.” Aiko released a mixtape on March 16, 2011 entitled Sailing Soul(s) via her official website, JheneAiko.com. All the songs on the mixtape were written by her, except “July” which was written by Micah Powell and most of the songs were produced by Fisticuffs, except “July” and “You vs Them” which were produced by Bei Maejor, “Real Now” which was produced by Roosevelt, “Do Better” which was produced by J. Lbs and “Growing Apart” which was produced by Tae Beast. The album\\'s artwork was shot by photographer Jay 3. The mixtape also features collaborations from Miguel, Drake, and Kanye West, as well as others.\\n\\nTo promote the mixtape Aiko was joined by Grammy-nominated R&B singer Miguel on a one-off free secret tour on Sunday, July 15. The free tickets were given away at the Key Club box office on July 6 from 11AM-5PM on a first-come, first-served basis. The concert started at 7:00pm and finished as 9:30pm, lasting a duration of two and a half hours. On October 21, 2012 Aiko released a music video for the song \"My Mine\".

Throughout the late 1980s and 90s, Soundgarden experienced major success as one of the major grunge bands (along with groups such as Alice in Chains, Nirvana, and Pearl Jam).\\n\\nIn 1990, Chris Cornell worked together with the (then) Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron, and Stone Gossard, Jeff Ament and Mike McCready (who would later form Pearl Jam) in a project named Temple of the Dog. They wrote a 10 song album as a tribute to Andrew Wood, the singer of Mother Love Bone who had died the year before of a heroin overdose.\\n\\nIn 1997 Soundgarden split at the zenith of their popularity due to tensions in the group and Chris began a solo career. He released the sucessful album Euphoria Morning.

       " 'Christopher John Davison (born 15 October 1948), known professionally as Chris de Burgh, is a British-Irish singer, instrumentalist, and songwriter. He started out as an art rock performer but subsequently started writing more pop-oriented material. He has had several top 40 hits in the UK and two in the US, but he is more popular in other countries, particularly Norway and Brazil. His 1986 love song \"The Lady in Red\" reached number one in several countries. De Burgh has sold over 45 million albums worldwide.\\n\\nDe Burgh was born in Venado Tuerto, Argentina, to Colonel Charles John Davison, MBE, a British diplomat, and Maeve Emily de Burgh, an Irish secretary. His maternal grandfather was Sir Eric de Burgh, a British Army officer who had been Chief of the General Staff in India during the Second World War. He took his mother\\'s name, \"de Burgh\", when he began performing. His father had substantial farming interests, and Chris spent much of his early years in Malta, Nigeria and Zaire, as he, his mother and brother accompanied Colonel Davison on his diplomatic and engineering work.\\n\\nThe Davisons finally settled in Bargy Castle, County Wexford, Ireland, which was somewhat dilapidated at the time. It was a twelfth-century castle which Eric de Burgh bought in the 1960s. He converted it into a hotel, and the young Chris sang for the guests there.\\n\\nAfter attending Marlborough College in Wiltshire, England, de Burgh went on to graduate from Trinity College, Dublin, with a Master of Arts degree in French, English and History. \\n\\nChris de Burgh signed his first contract with A&M Records in 1974, and supported Supertramp on their Crime of the Century tour, building himself a small fan base. His début album, Far Beyond These Castle Walls, was a folk-tinged stab at fantasy in the tradition of the Moody Blues. It failed to chart upon its release in late 1974. A few months later, he released a single called \"Turning Round\" from the album, released outside the UK and Ireland as \"Flying\". It failed to make an impression in the UK, but it stayed on top of the Brazilian charts for 17 weeks. This became a familiar pattern for the singer/songwriter, as every one of his 1970s albums failed to chart in the UK or US while they racked up big sales in continental European and South American countries.\\n\\nIn 1975 his second album, Spanish Train and Other Stories, was released. Whilst (again) not a huge commercial success, the album and tour expanded the fan base, with de Burgh starting to attract a cult following. Along with the epic title track, other fan favourite tracks from the album included \"Patricia The Stripper\" and \"A Spaceman Came Travelling\" (the latter released the following year as a single).\\n\\n1977\\'s third album, At the End of a Perfect Day, whilst well received and featuring both former Fairport Convention drummer Dave Mattacks and later Fairport drummer Gerry Conway, failed to push de Burgh\\'s career significantly, leading to the release of his fourth album Crusader in 1979. Crusader took a more electric direction, including guitar contributions from Ian Bairnson (formerly of Pilot), bass player David Paton (also of Pilot), and drummer Stuart Elliott (formerly of both Cockney Rebel and of Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel), all of whom were also working, at the time, with Kate Bush. The album also featured Sky keyboard player Francis Monkman and Mike Moran. Whilst it attracted a significant number of new fans, Crusader still failed to break through in the UK and US. 1980\\'s Eastern Wind also failed to build further on the (still cult) following in the major territories.\\n\\nIn 1981 de Burgh had his first UK chart entry with Best Moves, a collection culled from his early albums. It set the stage for 1982\\'s Rupert Hine produced The Getaway, which reached number 30 in the UK charts and number 43 in the US, thanks to the eerie single \"Don\\'t Pay the Ferryman\". Chris de Burgh\\'s follow-up album, Man on the Line, also performed well, charting at 69 in the US and 11 in the UK.\\n\\nChris de Burgh had an across-the-board success with the ballad \"The Lady in Red\" in late 1986; the single became a number one hit in the UK (number three in America) and its accompanying album, Into the Light, reached number two in the UK (number 25 in the U.S.). That Christmas season, a re-release of de Burgh\\'s 1976 Christmas song \"A Spaceman Came Travelling\" became a Top 40 hit in the UK. Flying Colours, his follow-up to Into the Light, entered the British charts at number one upon its 1988 release, yet it failed to make the American charts. De Burgh never hit the US charts again and his commercial fortunes began to slide slightly in Britain in the early 1990s, yet he retained a following around the world. This is mainly due to inactivity of his previous recording label A&M Records UK division in the U.S.\\n\\nIn 1997 de Burgh composed a song entitled \"There\\'s a New Star Up in Heaven Tonight\", dedicated to Diana, Princess of Wales. The song was released as a 100-copy limited edition and included on the compilations The Ultimate Collection (2000) and Now and Then (2009).\\n\\nIn 2007 a concert in Tehran was planned for mid-2008, together with local band Arian, which would have made Chris de Burgh the first western pop singer to perform in Iran since the 1979 revolution. However, the concert never went ahead because he had not been given permission by the Iranian authorities to perform in the country.\\n\\nHe was the first Western act to play in Lebanon after the Lebanese Civil War.\\n\\nOn 25 June 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Chris de Burgh among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chris+de+Burgh\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'The Missouri-born Chris Janson  has electrified Nashville\\'s country music scene. In fact, it only took two days at a local Nashville bar to incite a wave of interest from country music\\'s biggest record labels. It could be his intense and vocally stunning performances, his remarkable ability to play the harmonica, or the depth of his songs, but there is something remarkable about this 21 year-old phenomenon. Chris\\' budding music career has even taken him to the big screen, when legendary film director Johnathan Demme (Silence of the Lambs, Philadelphia, Stop Making Sense) invited him to participate in \"Heart of Gold\" a documentary capturing Neil Young\\'s 2-night performance at the Historic Ryman Auditorium. Asked to describe his sound, Chris replies that it combines \"elements of rock & roll, folk, blues, roots music, and vintage country.\" Nashville\\'s critics been buzzing with excitement about this emerging star, and have even likened him to a combination of Mick Jagger and Hank Williams Sr. Chris readily acknowledges his influences, but he has a confidence in his identity that transcends his age. \"I want to sound like Chris Janson,\" he says, \"It\\'s just what you see on stage, that\\'s what you\\'ll get on my record. I\\'m not afraid to push the limits. I don\\'t have a set list at my shows, I just play songs. It\\'s all about soul and feel\".

       " 'Chris Kenner (December 25, 1929 – January 25, 1976) was a New Orleans rhythm & blues singer and songwriter, best known for two hit singles, \"I Like It Like That\" and \"Land Of 1000 Dances\", in the early 1960s, that became staples in the repertoires of many other musicians.\\n\\nBorn in the farming community of Kenner, Louisiana, upriver from New Orleans, Kenner sang gospel music with his church choir, and moved to New Orleans in his teens. In 1955 he made his first recordings, for a small label, Baton Records, without success; and in 1957 recorded his \"Sick and Tired\" for the Imperial Records label; Fats Domino covered it the next year and the song became a hit. \"Rocket to the Moon\" and \"Life Is Just a Struggle,\" both cut for the Ron Records label, were other notable songs from this period.\\nMoving to another New Orleans label, Instant, he began to work with pianist and arranger Allen Toussaint. In 1961, this collaboration produced \"I Like It Like That\", his first and biggest hit, peaking at #2 in the Billboard Hot 100 chart (covered in 1965 by The Dave Clark Five) and \"Something You Got\" (covered by Alvin Robinson, the Ramsey Lewis Trio, Chuck Jackson, Earl Grant, Maxine Brown, Bobby Womack, Fairport Convention and Bruce Springsteen). \"I Like It Like That\" sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. In 1962 he produced his most enduring song, \"Land of a Thousand Dances,\" which was recorded by Cannibal & the Headhunters, Thee Midniters, Wilson Pickett, The Action and Patti Smith.\\nKenner continued to record for Instant and for various other small local labels, including many of his lesser-known songs from the 1960s, such as \"My Wife,\" \"Packing Up\" and \"They Took My Money\". He released an album on Atlantic Records in 1966; the Collectors\\' Choice label reissued the LP, Land of a Thousand Dances, on CD in 2007.\\nIn 1968 Kenner was convicted of statutory rape of a minor, and spent three years in Louisiana\\'s Angola prison.\\nKenner died from a heart attack in 1976, at the age of 46.\\n\\nSouthern Louisiana based R&B artist who started making records in 1955 for Baton Records, in 1957 he recorded \"Sick and Tired\" with Dave Bartholomew for the Imperial Records label; which became a hit only after Fats Domino covered it. His biggest 60\\'s records were 1961\\'s \"I Like It Like That\" recorded for Joe Banashak\\'s Instant label. The song \"I Like It Like That\" co-written with pianist Allen Toussaint reached number 2 in the US pop charts and Kenner later received a Grammy nomination for the song. \"I Like It Like That\" was also a 1965 hit for The Dave Clark Five , 70\\'s duo Loggins & Messina and there was a popular spanish Conjunto version by Fania artist Pete Rodriguez. Kenner wrote & recorded \"Something You Got\" which was a big 1965 hit for Chuck Jackson and Maxine Brown, while Kenner\\'s 1962\\'s \"Land of 1000 Dances\" hit #77 on the US charts, it was a bigger hit for Wilson Pickett and Cannibal & the Headhunters. \"Land of a 1000 Dances\", a perennial party fave was also later redone by The J. Geils Band,Roy Orbison, The Trashmen,The Ventures,Sam & Dave,The Residents, Johnny Rivers, Tina Turner, Tom Jones, Rufus Thomas, the Walker Brothers amongst many others. Firmly rooted in the regional New Orleans R&B scene, Kenner collaborated with contemporaries like Eddie Bocage aka Eddie Bo on songs like ‘All Night Rambler’. Later on he also laid down funkier sides like 1967’s ‘Fumigate Funky Broadway’. Kenner, a heavy drinker, was found guilty of statutory rape of a minor in 1968, and spent three years in Louisiana\\'s Angola prison, never regaining chart success before his death in 1976. \\nHe may also be the King of the Gypsies.

       " 'Dean Martin (born Dino Paul Crocetti; June 7, 1917 – December 25, 1995) was an American singer, actor, comedian, and producer. One of the most popular and enduring American entertainers of the mid-20th century, Martin was nicknamed the \"King of Cool\" for his seemingly effortless charisma and self-assurance. \\n\\nHe and Jerry Lewis formed the immensely popular comedy duo Martin and Lewis, with Martin serving as the straight man to Lewis\\' slapstick hijinks. Martin went on to become a star of concert stages, nightclubs, audio recordings, motion pictures, and television, and was also a member of the \"Rat Pack\". Martin was the host of the television variety programs The Dean Martin Show and The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts. His relaxed, warbling, crooning voice earned him dozens of hit singles, including his signature songs \"Memories Are Made of This\", \"That\\'s Amore\", \"Everybody Loves Somebody\", \"You\\'re Nobody Till Somebody Loves You\", \"Sway\", \"Volare\", and \"Ain\\'t That a Kick in the Head?\" \\n\\nMartin was born on June 7, 1917, in Steubenville, Ohio, to an Italian father, Gaetano Alfonso Crocetti (1894–1967), and an Italian-American mother, Angela Crocetti (née Barra; 1899–1966). They were married in 1914. His father, who was a barber, was originally from Montesilvano, in Abruzzo, and his maternal grandparents\\' origins are believed to be also from Abruzzo, although they are not clearly known. Martin had an older brother named William Alfonso Crocetti (1916–1968). Martin\\'s first language was Abruzzese, a dialect of Neapolitan, and he did not speak English until he started school at the age of five. He attended Grant Elementary School in Steubenville, where he was bullied for his broken English. He later took up the drums as a hobby as a teenager. Martin then dropped out of Steubenville High School in the 10th grade because he thought he was smarter than his teachers. He bootlegged liquor, served as a speakeasy croupier, was a blackjack dealer, worked in a steel mill, and boxed as a welterweight. \\n\\nAs Martin\\'s solo career grew, he and Frank Sinatra became friends. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Martin and Sinatra, along with friends Joey Bishop, Peter Lawford, and Sammy Davis, Jr. formed the Rat Pack, so-called after an earlier group of social friends, the Holmby Hills Rat Pack centered on Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, of which Sinatra had been a member (The Martin-Sinatra-Davis-Lawford-Bishop group referred to themselves as \"The Summit\" or \"The Clan\" and never as \"The Rat Pack\", although this has remained their identity in popular imagination). The men made films together, formed part of the Hollywood social scene, and were politically influential (through Lawford\\'s marriage to Patricia Kennedy, sister of President John F. Kennedy).\\n\\nThe Rat Pack was legendary for its Las Vegas Strip performances. For example, the marquee at the Sands Hotel might read DEAN MARTIN—MAYBE FRANK—MAYBE SAMMY. Their appearances were valuable because the city would flood with wealthy gamblers. Their act (always in tuxedo) consisted of each singing individual numbers, duets and trios, along with seemingly improvised slapstick and chatter. In the socially charged 1960s, their jokes revolved around adult themes, such as Sinatra\\'s womanizing and Martin\\'s drinking, as well as Davis\\'s race and religion. Sinatra and Martin supported the civil rights movement and refused to perform in clubs that would not allow African-American or Jewish performers. Posthumously, the Rat Pack has experienced a popular revival, inspiring the George Clooney/Brad Pitt \"Ocean\\'s Trilogy.\" \\n\\nMartin returned to films briefly with appearances in the star-laden, critically panned but commercially successful The Cannonball Run and its sequel Cannonball Run II. He also had a minor hit single with \"Since I Met You Baby\" and made his first music video, which appeared on MTV. The video was created by Martin\\'s youngest son, Ricci. On March 21, 1987, Martin\\'s son, actor Dean Paul Martin (formerly Dino of the 1960s \"teeny-bopper\" rock group Dino, Desi & Billy), died when his F-4 Phantom II jet fighter crashed while flying with the California Air National Guard. Martin\\'s grief over his son\\'s death left him depressed and demoralized. Later, a tour with Davis and Sinatra in 1988, undertaken in part to help Martin recover, sputtered.\\n\\nMartin, who responded best to a club audience, felt lost in the huge stadiums they were performing in at Sinatra\\'s insistence, and he was not interested in drinking until dawn after performances. His final Vegas shows were at Bally\\'s Hotel in 1990. There he had his final reunion with Lewis on his 72nd birthday. Martin\\'s last two TV appearances involved tributes to his former Rat Pack members. On December 8, 1989, he joined stars in Sammy Davis Jr\\'s 60th anniversary celebration, which aired a few weeks before Davis died from throat cancer. In December 1990, he congratulated Sinatra on his 75th birthday special. \\n\\nMartin, a heavy smoker, was diagnosed with lung cancer at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in September 1993, and was told that he would require surgery to prolong his life, but he rejected it. He retired from public life in early 1995 and died of acute respiratory failure resulting from emphysema at his Beverly Hills home on Christmas Day, 1995 at the age of 78. The lights of the Las Vegas Strip were dimmed in his honor. Martin\\'s body was interred at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. The crypt features the epitaph \"Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime\", the title of his signature song. \\n\\nIn 1996, Ohio Route 7 through Steubenville was rededicated as Dean Martin Boulevard. Road signs bearing an Al Hirschfeld caricature of Martin\\'s likeness designate the stretch with a historical marker bearing a small picture and brief biography in the Gazebo Park at Route 7 and North Fourth Street. An annual Dean Martin Festival celebration is held in Steubenville. Impersonators, friends and family, and entertainers, many of Italian ancestry, appear. In 2005, Clark County, Nevada, renamed a portion of Industrial Road as Dean Martin Drive. A similarly named street was dedicated in 2008 in Rancho Mirage, California. Martin\\'s family was presented a gold record in 2004 for Dino: The Essential Dean Martin, his fastest-selling album, which also hit the iTunes Top 10, and in 2006 it was certified \"Platinum\".\\n\\nFor the week ending December 23, 2006, the Dean Martin and Martina McBride duet of \"Baby, It\\'s Cold Outside\" reached No. 7 on the R&R AC chart. It also went to No. 36 on the R&R Country chart – the last time Martin had a song this high in the charts was in 1965, with the song \"I Will,\" which reached No. 10 on the Pop chart. An album of duets, Forever Cool, was released by Capitol/EMI in 2007. It features Martin\\'s voice with Kevin Spacey, Shelby Lynne, Joss Stone, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Robbie Williams, McBride and others. His footprints were immortalized at Grauman\\'s Chinese Theatre in 1964. Martin has three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one at 6519 Hollywood Boulevard for movies; the second at 1617 Vine for recordings; and a third at 6651 Hollywood Boulevard for television. In February 2009, Martin was honored with a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Four of his surviving children, Gail, Deana, Ricci and Gina accepted it on his behalf. In 2010, Martin received a posthumous star on the Italian Walk of Fame in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\\n\\nMartin was married three times. His first wife was Elizabeth Anne \"Betty\" McDonald, (July 14, 1922 – July 11, 1989) of Ridley Park, Pennsylvania. Martin and McDonald married in 1941 and had four children: Craig Martin (born 1942), Claudia Martin (March 16, 1944 – February 16, 2001), Gail Martin (born 1945); and Deana Martin (born 1948). Martin and McDonald divorced in 1949 and Dean gained custody of their children. Betty lived out her life in relative obscurity in San Francisco, California.\\n\\nMartin\\'s second wife was Dorothy Jean \"Jeanne\" Biegger (March 27, 1927 – August 24, 2016), a former Orange Bowl queen from Coral Gables, Florida. Their marriage lasted 24 years (1949–1973) and produced three children: Dean Paul Martin (November 17, 1951 – March 21, 1987), Ricci Martin (September 20, 1953 – August 3, 2016)[15] and Gina Martin (born 1956).\\n\\nMartin\\'s third marriage, to Catherine Hawn, lasted three years before Martin initiated divorce proceedings. They had no biological children of their own but Martin adopted Hawn\\'s daughter, Sasha.\\n\\nMartin\\'s uncle was Leonard Barr, who appeared in several of his shows. In the 1960s and early 1970s, he lived at 363 Copa De Oro Road in Bel Air, Los Angeles, before selling it to Tom Jones for $500,000 in June 1976.\\n\\nMartin\\'s son-in-law was the Beach Boys\\' Carl Wilson, who married Martin\\'s daughter Gina.

       " 'Chris Montez (born January 17, 1943) is a Mexican-American singer. Initially known as a rock n roll artist, Montez became one of the most important chicano rockers following the tragic passing of Ritchie Valens, his mentor. Montez had a #4 hit in the US with the 1962 single \"Let\\'s Dance\". Later, he was reinvented as a middle of the road easy listening singer, boasting a slew of Hot 100/Adult Contemporary crossover hits, predominantly renditions of jazz standards such as \"The More I See You\", \"There Will Never Be Another You\", and \"Time After Time\".\\n\\nBorn Ezekiel Christopher Montanez in Los Angeles, California, Montez was brought up in Hawthorne, California. His early musical influences included the latino music played and performed by residents of his neighborhood, as well as Ritchie Valens. After the release of the highly successful \"Let\\'s Dance\" on Monogram Records, Montez spent several years touring with artists such as Sam Cooke, The Platters, and Smokey Robinson and The Miracles, as well as The Beatles, then relatively unknown outside of Liverpool. \\n\\nEarly in 1963, Montez would score another hit with \"Some Kinda Fun\". Reaching #43 on the charts, the song utilized the same catchy keyboard instrumentation as did \"Let\\'s Dance\"; fittingly, both were million sellers, and were awarded gold discs. 1963 also saw the release of Montez\\'s only album on Monogram, Let\\'s Dance and Have Some Kinda\\' Fun!!!. Shortly before Monogram folded, Montez was paired up with Kathy Young, releasing two singles as the duo Chris & Kathy, most notably surf rock classic \"Shoot That Curl\". While at Monogram, Montez wrote, or co-wrote, several of his own songs, such as \"Chiquita Mia\", \"Let\\'s Do the Limbo\" and \"No No No\".\\n\\nTwo years later, Montez was practically a non-entity in the music business; however, Herb Alpert, co-founder of A&M Records, cordially invited Montez to resume his recording career at A&M. When Montez attempted to replicate his earlier rock \\'n\\' roll success, however, Alpert personally suggested that Montez try a different approach: a middle of the road, soft ballad sound. While not particularly interested in changing his style of music, Montez decided to trust Alpert\\'s instincts.\\n\\n\"Call Me\", a cover version of a Petula Clark song, was the first single from his 1966 album, The More I See You / Call Me, earning Montez his biggest hit in years, eventually reaching #22. The song has since become an easy listening standard. The album\\'s title cut, Montez\\'s second single, was a source of confusion for certain radio disc jockeys who were unfamiliar with Montez\\' past as a rocker; when back-announcing the song, they would often refer to Montez as being female, likely owing to Montez\\'s falsetto singing style. This confusion would be cleared up by the time the album, bearing Montez\\'s pictures on the front and back sleeve, was released.\\n\\nMontez would record three more albums for A&M: Time After Time (1966), Foolin\\' Around (1967), and Watch What Happens (1968). Although quite stylistically similar to his first hit album on A&M, they failed to mirror its success, although Time After Time\\'s title cut and \"Because of You\" both managed to crack the Hot 100. In 1968, Montez departed from A&M on a three-year sabbatical. In 1972, Montez released a big hit single in Brazil, \"Loco por ti\". By this time, he had returned to his rock roots, albeit with more noticeable pop influence than before.\\n\\nTwo years later, now with CBS Records, Montez released The Best of Chris Montez, a compilation consisting of both old and new material, the newer bearing little to no resemblance to his past hits. While at CBS, he released one more album: Raza: Ay no digas, which fared well in international markets but failed to make an impact in the US. In 1983, Montez released his final album, Cartas de Amor, all of its songs being sung in Spanish. Although his recording career appears to be behind him, Montez is still an active musician, performing to mostly foreign audiences.\\n\\nIn 2008, Frozen Pictures announced plans to make a documentary on Montez\\'s life and career, El viaje musical de Ezekiel Montanez: The Chris Montez Story. The film, focusing on Montez\\'s multi-faceted musical career and considerable influence, has been previewed at several film festivals, but has not seen domestic release. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Montez\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Raised in New Zealand, but returning to England in 1974, Thompson went on ot join Manfred Mann\\'s Earth Band in time for the breakout album The Roaring Silence featuring the worldwide number one hit Blinded By The Light (written and performed by Bruce Springsteen). He kept the Mann engine running with vocals on such hits as Spirit In The Night, You Angel You, Davy\\'s On The Road Again, Lies (Throught The 80s), For You and Runner.\\nHe took a brief hiatus in 1979 to record with his new band Night. The self-titled debut produced two top 50 hits with Hot Summer Nights and If You Remember Me, the latter from the film \"The Champ\". Night produced a second album Long Distance and Chris returned to the Mann camp in time to record the Somewhere In Afrika album featuring the hit Runner. Chris then co-produced the Live In Budapest album and video with drummer John Lingwood.\\nIn 1983 Thompson released his first solo album Out Of The Night and worked extensively with Doobie Brothers\\'s Patrick Simmons on his first solo album Arcade. Chris\\'s second album Radio Voices featured Queen\\'s Brian May. Chris wrote and performed the official championship song The Challenge for the 1989 Wimbledon Tennis Championships.\\nFrom 1983 trough 1985 Thompson performed both live and in the studio with The Alan Parson\\'s Project, which resulted in the hit single You\\'re The Voice which was also a top hit for John Farnham.

Thompson began gigging with legendary folk scene musicians such as Wizz Jones, Davy Graham, Bert Jansch, John Martyn and many others.\\nIn 1973, Thompson released a self-titled album on the \\'Village Thing\\' label; self-produced, from \\'home-made\\' tapes, and recorded at Apple Studios. The main players consist of himself on guitar and vocals, Keshav Sathe on Tabla, and Brian Dunning on flute. The style is reminiscent of John Renbourn. Thompson wrote all the music and lyrics, bar one song, which is an adaptation of a W.B. Yeats poem. He appears to have returned to New Zealand shortly after this. \\n\\n3) Chris Thompson is an American Youtuber formerly known as Supricky06 who records with Peter Hollens and with Meghan Tonjes. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Thompson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Born and raised in Houston TX, Chris Walker began singing before he began speaking. Like most Southern grown soul singers, he got his start in the church as a member of his family gospel group, The Walker Brothers.  Chris plays the bass upside down like one of his early hero’s Jimi Hendrix. The Walker’s raised their children with a strong hand, and once Chris graduated from the High School of Performing and Visual Arts in Houston, he was all too happy to high-tail it to New York, with only forty dollars, in pursuit of his dreams of doing his own music. With aspirations of attending the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, he sold his bass amp and bought a one-way ticket to New York; despite being denied due to inability to pay the tuition. Fate, however, would intervene as Walker was walking the halls and happened to come upon a jam session in need of a bass player. When he took the stage and fell into place with the other musicians the school dean just so happened to hear him and offered him a full scholarship on the spot and so begun another chapter in his musical journey.\\n In his tenure at the school, Chris was afforded the opportunity to play with such Jazz greats as Ornette Coleman, Art Blakey, Bob James, Jimmy Heath, Cassandra Wilson and countless others. Mastering his skills on the drums, bass, piano and guitar his musicianship garnered him a position as the musical director for R&B songstress Regina Belle as well as touring with Ornette Coleman. For the next two years he juggled between the two tours until forced to have to choose between conflicting schedules; and with his own desire to sing and do music burgeoning, he chose to stay with Ms. Belle.\\nWhile touring with Regina Belle, who at the time was in the height of her career, Chris came to the attention of then CBS record executive Ruben Rodriguez during an artist showcase and he was impressed by Walker’s vocal ability on “All I Want is Forever” a duet previously recorded by Ms. Belle and James “JT” Taylor.  Rodriguez originally wanted to recruit Chris for CBS but he decided to make Walker the first artist on his own independent label, Pendulum Records. \\nChris Walker’s first Pendulum release “First Time” produced two top five singles; “Giving You All My Love” and “Take Time,” which crossed over to become top 30 on the pop charts. His second Pendulum release entitled Sincerely Yours unfortunately didn’t fair as well from a sales perspective, but Walker still remained in demand as a vocalist and touring musician. As a student and lover of jazz music it was an opportunity that came via a former teacher, Gil Goldstein, that would bring to fruition a longtime dream of Walker.“ I was at a concert one day with my then girlfriend and we were watching Al Jarreau” He remembers, “ I remember being so in awe because I loved Al Jarreau and told her one day I’m going to perform with him.” Almost as if he had spoke it into existence, it wasn’t long after that his teacher called and asked if he would like to perform with Al Jarreau. Needless to say, he got the gig and Walker has worked as Jarreau’s musical director ever since.\\nWith things in the industry coming full circle for Walker, in 2007 he and his partner Ray J. Davis, formed Walker Davis Entertainment and later signed Regina Belle in association with Ruben Rodriguez and Pendulum Records. Having spent the last several decades creating music for other artists, Chris is ready to put his artist hat back on and is ready to release a new project on his own label imprint. The first single “I Got That Love” is proof that Walker hasn’t missed a beat by any means. The mid-tempo groove is a refreshing testament to love-making for the grown and sexy. The track, produced by Chris Walker, is a culmination of some of the influences Walker credits with his love of music including Donny Hathaway, Marvin Gaye and Luther Vandross. His vocal range treads the scale with a romantic delicacy that marries his lower register and falsetto perfectly, as is showcased in his cover of a classic Luther Vandross song, If Only For One Night. With the experience of his craft as his backdrop, his vocal stylings sets him apart from the pack thanks to his distinguished and recognizable style. “Performing is like an out of body experience for me” explains Walker. “And I do whatever it takes to translate that feeling to my audience when I perform.” Chris is currently working with film producer/director, Andres Santamaria, who spent the past year traveling the US and Europe with the entertainer chronicling his life for a documentary. The documentary is set to be released around April, 2011 and his new CD, “ZONE” will be available 30Aug    <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Walker\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Chris Willis is a simplification of Christopher Willis (b. 1978, Ohio, USA), a singer-songwriter and producer. Willis made his recording début singing on \"Handel\\'s Messiah: A Soulful Celebration\" (Sep 1992, Reprise) and his latest appearances are, as singer-songwriter, on David Guetta\\'s \"One More Love\" (Nov 2010, Virgin).\\n\\nMake no mistake: You know and love the voice—and it belongs to Chris Willis.\\n\\nAt once soulful and gritty, Willis’ voice has fueled numerous dance and top 40 pop hits, including the 2007 charttopper, “Love Is Gone,” which dominated charts around the world, and “Everytime We Touch,” a Top 10 European smash earlier this year.\\n\\nIn a world of sound-alike dance divas, Willis is that rare male vocalist doing dance music successfully. But the man does more than sing. He’s an accomplished producer and stellar songwriter. Still, you may not necessarily know his name or face. But that is about to change. It is 2009, dance music is pop music (again!) and Willis is ready for his close-up.\\n\\nYou see, Willis is a featured vocalist on über-hot French DJ/producer David Guetta’s fourth album, “One Love.” (The two have been making sweet music together for nearly 10 years.) Surely, Guetta’s name rings a bell. The man, after all, is responsible for two of the summer’s biggest pop-dance hits: his own track, “When Love Takes Over” (featuring Kelly Rowland), and The Black Eyed Peas’ 1 smash “I Gotta Feeling.” Both are featured on “One Love,” as are guest turns from Ne-Yo, Akon, Estelle and other A-listers.\\n\\n“With all the other celebrities involved in this project, the fact is more people will probably hear [it] than any of [Guetta’s] previous albums,” Willis says. “As a result, not only is there potential for change with regard to dance music in America, but everyone—David, the celebrities, myself and especially the fans—has the potential to gain from this new light.”\\n\\nIndeed. Dance music is no longer viewed as the bastard child of the music industry. R&B and pop superstars are lining up to work with tastemaking electronic/dance DJs. Consider this a major shift in the musical landscape. “These superstars have just caught on to what I discovered, or should I say discovered me, years ago,” Willis explains. “It speaks to the appeal of dance music that is alive in the world. Here is a genre that takes the raw and true energy of creative genius and invites it to the best party of individuals the world has ever known—the dance music community—and says, just like it did to me 10 years ago, ‘We love you. We love the pure essence of what you do. Come and dance with us.’ And so they do.”\\n\\nWillis and Guetta forged a creative union in 2001 when Guetta tapped Willis to be the featured singer on his debut single, “Just a Little More Love.” They’ve been recording together ever since. According to Willis, their working relationship has changed over the years. “It started with the focus on my participation as a singer and songwriter. It has evolved to the point where I’m not only writing the lyrics and singing, but I’m producing my own vocals and co-producing other vocals on the project.” Willis produced some of Kelly Rowland\\'s vocals on the \"One Love\" project.\\n\\nLike dance music itself, Willis’ musical influences are many and include such R&B/pop legends as Stevie Wonder, James Ingram, Madonna, Prince, Donny Hathaway and Michael Jackson. (He is especially fond of “Off the Wall”-era Jackson.)\\n\\nIt’s no surprise that Willis’ self-titled debut album, a contemporary gospel collection released in 1996, was steeped in the R&B-flavored sounds of the artists that inspired him. “Chris Willis” spotlighted a newcomer whose enthusiasm for mixing gospel, soul and pop was heard by many in the music industry. With new fans in powerful places, Willis quickly became an in-demand session singer, songwriter and backing vocalist and has, over the years, worked with “American Idol” superstars Kelly Clarkson and Clay Aiken; gospel greats CeCe Winans, Amy Grant and Take 6; venerable icons like Dusty Springfield, country charttoppers Dolly Parton, Kenny Rogers and Brooks & Dunn and quintessential pop producers Quincy Jones and Desmond Child.\\n\\n\"One of the most incredible things about this journey is how varied the twists and turns have been and where they\\'ve taken me. Years flew by before I realized that the experiences in and out of diverse genres had brought out the chameleon in me. It\\'s certainly a pleasure to pull from the bag of tricks sharpened in the studio, on stage, or in the background, and to use them now as a frontman. It hasn\\'t always been an easy ride, but it\\'s all worked to polish what I bring to the world.\"\\n\\nIt was Willis’ co-production credit on Parisian pop stars 2BE3’s album, “Excuse My French,” that opened the door to David Guetta’ inviting Willis to sing on that ubiquitous title track from his 2002 debut album, “Just a Little More Love.” The Willis-Guetta union proved to be fruitful, with seven collaborations on the album, including the worldwide club/radio hits “Love Don’t Let Me Go” and “Just a Little More Love.” Willis—and Guetta—were catapulted into the international pop spotlight.\\n\\nTwo years later, Guetta tapped Willis, again, to contribute to his sophomore album, “Guetta Blaster.” Willis delivered the vocal goods on such songs as “Stay”, \"Time\" and “Money.” The creative partnership between Willis and Guetta was only heating up. For Guetta’s third album, 2007’s “Pop Life,” Willis was featured on five tracks (of these, he wrote three), including the club anthem-turned-pop radio hits “Love Is Gone,” “Everytime We Touch” and a mashed-up, anthemic reworking of “Love Don’t Let Me Go (Walking Away)” with The Egg.\\n\\nNow, along comes Guetta’s fourth studio album, “One Love,” with Willis’ powerful vocals heard on three tracks: the hard-hitting “Gettin’ Over”, electro-smacked “The Sound of Letting Go” and the empowering bonus track \"It\\'s Your Life.\" In signature fashion, Willis—who supplies the melody and lyrics—sings of love and relationships, of love found and lost. “These are the sources of my lyrical inspiration,” he says. “It always comes back to love.”\\n\\nWhen asked to forecast his own future, Willis says, “I have always dreamed of living a pop life in the pop world just like Prince, Michael or Madonna—you know, cutting-edge, mysterious, magical. But I never in a million years dreamed I’d have anything to do with dance music. Just like disco music escalated to popularity in the ’70s, dance and pop music seem to be colliding again. The world knows me now as a mix of the two. I have a new dream now: to continue to merge these two worlds together more and more. It’s already happening. I’d be a fool not to grow with it and let it take me beyond my imagination.”\\n\\nWhich begs the question: Where oh where is Chris\\' own debut release? Pausing for a moment, Willis says it’s all about timing and strategy. “The last thing you want to do is release a project and it gets overlooked,” he explains. “I’m ready to release a solo album. The songs are here—love, loss, passion and hope. The interest is building. It’s only just a matter of time.”\\n\\nSites: Discogs and Wikipedia <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Willis\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Grammy award-winning Chrisette Michele Payne (born c. 1982), known professionally as Chrisette Michele, is an American R&B singer on the Def Jam Recordings record label. She has been featured on such popular hiphop albums as Jay-Z\\'s Kingdom Come and Nas\\' Hip Hop Is Dead. She sings in a jazz style reminiscent of past singers such as Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald.\\n\\nSurrounded by music since she was a small child, singer, songwriter and composer Chrisette Michele has been blessed with an old soul and this Long Island bred vocalist has a deep appreciation for the harmonic foundations that includes gospel and jazz. “I did my first solo when I was four years old,” Chrisette remembers.\\n\\nCurrently putting the finishing touches on her soulful debut album, an artistic exploration that fuses Chrisette’s diverse musical interest into a wonderland, the young artist couldn’t be more pleased. “I realize that I’m new to the music world, but I’ve been preparing for this moment for long time.”\\n\\nEven before signing on the dotted line of her Def Jam contract last year, the multitalented soul sister had toured with more established artists like Kem and India Arie. “India saw me singing at the Village Underground in New York City. She came backstage that first night and graciously offered me a gig as her opening act.”\\n\\nWorking hard in the studio writing songs and recording demos, Chrisette finished an album worth of material before even trying to get signed. “I’ve been creating songs since I was twelve, so I knew I needed the right musical blend in order to stand-out from the many other performers trying to get a deal.”\\n\\nWhile not hung-up on genre labels, Chrisette Michele says, “I’m excited about finding my place amongst young composers like Alicia Keys and Jill Scott. My goal from the moment I was signed by Antonio “LA” Reid, Chairman and CEO, Island Def Jam Music Group, was to create a seamless album that mixes soul and pop in a way that will have people coming back to again and again.” Favorite contemporary artists that are in high rotation include, Beyonce, Kanye West and NAS.\\n\\nDays after giving LA “goose bumps” during the audition, the young singer found herself in a California studio called Brandon’s Way having a creative conversation with Babyface.\\n\\nOver the course of a few days, the duo recorded seven tracks, four of which will be heard on her upcoming release. “Babyface and I got into a conversation about the love he has for his children,” she says. “So, the first song I penned was called ‘My Joy.’ It’s a song about a child speaking to his or her father, and I think it’s quite special. Observing the artistry that Babyface possesses has hopefully made me a better performer as well.”\\n\\nHaving grown-up in the suburbs of Long Island, Chrisette didn’t spend much time planted in front of the television. “My parents had me in girl scouts, tap class and piano lessons,” Chrisette says. “It wasn’t like I was cut off from the world, but there just wasn’t a lot of media influence in my life during those early years.”\\n\\nChrisette Michele has always been true to herself. “I don’t feel as though I was the typical deacon’s kid, because I was taught early on to speak my mind and not be afraid to think,” she says. “To me, that is one of things that helped keep me focused as an artist who is trying to do something different in music.”\\n\\nA self-described “girly girl” Chrisette says, “I have definite older child syndrome. I helped my mom raise my brothers like they were my own children, but I also had the pleasure of being daddy’s little princess.”\\n\\nIn addition to her own relatives, Chrisette was blessed with an extended family that included the many folks that her mother allowed to room in their house. “If my mother saw a homeless pregnant woman on the street, chances are they would soon be staying with us,” Chrisette laughs. “I learned so much about the world listening to these folk’s stories, and to this day their experiences can be heard in my material.”\\n\\nThough already a fan of gospel and classical, it wasn’t until Chrisette Michele was seventeen that she also developed a passion for jazz. “When I was still in high school a teacher introduced me to jazz singer Astrud Gilberto, and afterwards my life was all about jazz,” she remembers.\\n\\nMajoring in music at 5 Towns College in Long Island, Chrisette cites the nurturing sway of her teachers for where she is today. “Although I did have talent, often that is not enough,” she says. “My professors taught me how to be a professional and to be serious about my music. They taught me how to put the music that I dream about at night on paper in the morning.”\\n\\nWith the release of her debut album, Chrisette Michele will soon be sharing those musical dreams with the rest of the world. \\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chrisette+Michele\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Christina Milian (born Christine Marie Flores on September 26, 1981) is an American rnb and pop singer-songwriter, record producer, dancer, actress, and former MTV VJ. \\n\\nMilian was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, United States, to Cuban parents Don and Carmen. She has two younger sisters, Dannielle and Elizabeth. Her family moved to Waldorf, Maryland soon after her birth and she set her heart on an entertainment career at the age of four. Milian shot commercials for (Wendy\\'s, Honeycomb) and played the lead role in the musical Annie before moving to Los Angeles at thirteen to pursue an acting career. Soon after the family\\'s move, her father divorced her mother. Milian graduated from Westlake High School in Waldorf, Maryland; and also attended Matthew Henson Middle School in Indian Head, Maryland.\\n\\nIn 2000, Milian made her first official musical appearance on Ja Rule\\'s second studio album Rule 3:36, performing guest vocals on his song \"Between Me and You\". Released as the album\\'s lead single in 2001, the track managed to peak at #11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and in the top 30 of the UK singles chart, building Milian\\'s reputation as a singer. Milian also appeared in Mýa\\'s video for \"Best of Me\" playing a friend. In the meantime Milian co-wrote and provided extensive backing vocals for the track \"Play\" for Jennifer Lopez\\'s 2001 album J. Lo which became another success. Milian would later pass down the song to Lopez because of already having a club song with \"AM to PM\" as promotion. She also went on to co-write \"Same Ol\\' Same Ol\", the first single from girl group PYT\\'s debut album Down With Me.\\n\\nIn 2001, Milian eventually released her first solo single, \"AM to PM\", off her self-titled debut album. The song became a worldwide hit reaching the top 5 in the UK and Denmark, top 10 in the Netherlands, and top 30 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and in Australia. The success of \"AM to PM\" sparked the international release of the Christina Milian album which she co-wrote and produced, although not in the United States. The second single \"When You Look At Me\" was another international hit reaching the top 5 in the UK, Netherlands, and Ireland and making the top 40 in Denmark, Germany, Australia, and France. Although a music video for the album\\'s third single \"Get Away\" (another collaboration with Ja Rule) was filmed in Paris, the single was not released officially.\\n\\nAfterwards Milian also was featured on the track \"It\\'s All Gravy\", a duet with British Rapper Romeo of the UK garage group So Solid Crew. While the song was another UK top ten hit single in 2002, Milian provided the theme song for the hit Disney series Kim Possible, \"Call Me, Beep Me\" later that year. In 2002, she also collaborated with Hilary Duff on her Christmas album Santa Claus Lane, on the song \"I Heard Santa on the Radio.\"\\n\\nIn 2003, Milian started recording songs with Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins, Bloodshy & Avant and Cory Rooney for her first U.S. release, It\\'s About Time (whose title is a direct reference to how long it had taken for one of her albums to be released domestically). The album was released to positive reviews on July 13, 2004, but failed to receive immense commercial success when it debuted at #21 in the UK and #14 on the Billboard 200 album chart, selling over 36,000 copies in the first week only. While It\\'s about Time ended up with lackluster sales of 394,000 copies in the United States, it gained prominence when it received a Grammy nomination for \"Best Contemporary R&B Album\" in 2005.\\n\\nThe album\\'s first single, \"Dip It Low\" (written by singer Teedra Moses and Black Eyed Peas producer Poli Paul) however, became Milian\\'s biggest hit to date, when it peaked at #1 on a world composite dance chart (compiled on data from the U.S., UK, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Australia), simultaneously reaching #2 in the UK, #5 in the U.S., #7 in New Zealand and the top 20 in Germany, Switzerland, Ireland, Norway and the Netherlands. The single was also certified Gold by the RIAA for digital sales. The album\\'s second and final single, \"Whatever U Want\" (featuring Joe Budden) failed to reprise the success of the lead single, but again reached the top 10 in the UK as well as charting on the Billboard Hot 100.\\n\\nMilian\\'s third studio album So Amazin\\' was released on May 16, 2006. Milian worked with Cool & Dre on the majority of the production of the album, and the project was finished with additional help from Rich Harrison and executive producers Jay-Z and LA Reid. Christina mentions working with Cool & Dre for the entire album \"made a more consistent, very real and personal album\" compared to her other works. The record\\'s first single \"Say I\" featured rapper Young Jeezy and was released in March 2006 as a single and video. The song made it to number 1 on iTunes UK Music Store and was number 1 on AOL music, but altogether saw moderate success only with peak positions on #21 in the United States, #4 in the UK and #45 in Australia.\\n\\nWhile So Amazin\\' failed to reach the top 10 when it debuted at #11 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, the album saw minor international success only, peaking at #67 in the UK inter alia. With \"Gonna Tell Everybody\" a second single from the album was chosen, but Island Def Jam neither agreed to film a music video nor booked promotional appearances for Milian to promote the song. In June 2006, instead, Milian\\'s representative confirmed that she had left the Island Def Jam record label due to \"creative differences\" - though disappointing album sales were believed to be the main factor, since the album sold less than 500,000 worldwide (over 130,000 in United States).\\n\\nDue to the low sales of So Amazin\\', Milian released her first compilation album, titled The Best of Christina Milian on November 22, 2006. The album was released under the Universal International label. The album includes her hit singles and songs that she hand picked herself from her first three studio albums, Christina Milian, It\\'s About Time, and So Amazin\\', though, only one track, Say I, was chosen from So Amazin\\', possibly due to the fact that it is her lowest selling album. The album was only released in Japan and some other Asian countries; but was not released in the U.S. or Europe. The album peaked at a disappointing #29 on the Japanese ORICON Albums Chart, and has sold only 38,078 copies to date.\\n\\nFollowing her departure from Island Def Jam Music Group, Milian signed with MySpace Records in 2008. She began writing songs and recording in the studio with numerous different producers, including Cool & Dre, J. R. Rotem, The Runners, Danja, Madd Scientist, T-Pain, Jim Jonsin and Toby Gad. Milian was featured on the cover of Rap-Up\\'s 2008 Winter issue, in which she announced that the album\\'s title was Dream in Color. A single was released in October 2008, ballad \"Us Against the World\". It was written by Milian and produced by Madd Scientist. The single, described by Milian as a \"cinematic power ballad\", premiered via MySpace on October 6, 2008, and was made available by digital download the next day. Milian felt that Madd Scientist \"brought the best out of me\" while producing \"Us Against the World\", and \"was really able to do some amazing things with my vocals\".\\n\\nAfter recording songs with the aforementioned producers, Milian took a break from music and started filming Bring It On: Fight to the Finish. When Milian returned to music, she concentrated on promoting her single \"Us Against the World\", and shot its music video. Since then, Milian said that she became \"a little bit more meticulous with what I feel deserved to be on the album\", and resumed recording. Songs recorded for the album included the 90\\'s Madonna-styled ballad \"Stay\", Euro-club record \"Tug of War\" and the feel-good song \"Diamonds\", which featured Kanye West. Other features included Rick Ross on the Cool & Dre produced track \"Blissful\", and Pitbull.\\n\\nIn early 2009, Milian began working with The-Dream, Tricky Stewart, and L.O.S. Da Maestro, which led to her signing a deal with Radio Killa Records. Milian revealed that aside from \"Us Against the World\", The-Dream and Tricky Stewart would be producing all the songs on her album. In March 2009, Milian changed the album\\'s title to Elope. Regarding the album\\'s title change, Milian explained, \"the definition of elope is to run away secretly with one\\'s beloved. This next album is about taking responsibility for yourself and making your own decisions.\" In June 2009, The-Dream said that the album was finished. Upon completion of the album, Milian said it represented \"independence, not having to answer to any type of \\'authority\\', being a woman at her best and feeling very confident\". She said that fans could expect an \"edgy sound with lots of strong powerful anthems. Big up tempos, R&B and Pop at it\\'s [sic] best and two big ballads\".\\n\\nIn August 2009, Milian confirmed that she had signed a deal to release Elope through Interscope Records, with a 2010 release date. Originally scheduled to be released in 2009, Tricky Stewart explained the delay, saying \"we just got our label deals done, so the reason why some of these projects got delayed had to do with technicalities and things of that nature\". The album has been furthered delayed because of Milian\\'s marriage to The-Dream and her pregnancy. In January 2010, Milian said that she was going back into the studio in the summer to record more material. Although the album had already been finished when Milian took a break for her pregnancy, she wanted to \"go back and re-do some of the music and make some new songs and find my new inspiration\". In October 2009, Tricky Stewart said that another single had yet to be chosen, and that it would be the first single off Elope. Reported choices for the first single include \"Zipper\", \"I\\'m a Cheat\", and \"Supersonic\".\\n\\nOn February 26, 2010, Milian gave birth to their daughter Violet, although in July 2010, The-Dream announced that he and Milian had separated. Milian was scheduled to resume recording in July 2010 to complete the album; however, after her separation from The-Dream, Milian opted to focus on her acting career. Despite the separation, Milian and The-Dream continued to \"work together and write together\". At the 2010 Los Angeles Fashion Week, Milian performed \"Zipper\" and \"Dip It Low\". At the 2010 American Music Awards, Milian announced that her untitled fourth studio album will be released in 2011. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Christina+Milian\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Christine McVie (born Christine Anne Perfect, July 12, 1943, in Birmingham, passed away 30 November 2022) was an English singer, keyboardist, and songwriter. Her primary fame came as a member of the band Fleetwood Mac, though she has also released three solo albums. McVie is said to have become addicted to Rock and Roll from the first time she looked through a Fats Domino songbook.\\n\\nEarly life\\n\\nChristine Anne Perfect was born on July 12th, 1943. Her father, Cyril, was a college professor and concert violinist, and mother Beatrice (called Tee) was a medium, a psychic and a faith healer. Her grandfather had played the organ in Westminster Abbey. Although Christine had been introduced to the piano at age four, she didn\\'t really take to music until she was 11. She continued taking classical music lessons until the age of 15, when her older brother, John, brought home a Fats Domino songbook which transformed her musical interest from classical music to rock n\\' roll. Other early influences include The Everly Brothers and The Beatles.\\n\\n[edit]\\nEarly Music\\n\\nChristine studied sculpture at an art college in Birmingham, England for 5 years, with the goal of becoming an art teacher. During that time she met a number of budding musicians in England\\'s blues scene. During her time at college Christine joined a small blues band called \"Shades Of Blue\" in which she played bass, also in her spare she would sing with Spencer Davis. After 5 years Christine graduated from art college with a teaching degree. She moved to London, where she worked briefly as a department store window-dresser.\\n\\n[edit]\\nChicken Shack\\n\\nIn 1968 she met up with her friends Andy Sylvester & Stan Webb, and they invited her to play keyboards/piano and sing background vocals in their band Chicken Shack, a blues band which had difficulty finding mainstream success. Christine stayed with Chicken Shack for 2 albums and together they scored the top 10 British hit \"I\\'d Rather Go Blind\" with Christine on lead vocals. She was also given a Melody Maker award for female vocalist of the year, and she was lauded for having one of the \"top 10 pairs of legs in all of Britain\". Christine left Chicken Shack in 1969 after meeting Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie.\\n\\nFleetwood Mac\\n\\nChristine was a big fan of Fleetwood Mac at the time and while touring with Chicken Shack the two bands would often run into each other. Encouraged to continue her career, she recorded a solo album, Christine Perfect, which she does not feel is among her better works. As Christine McVie, she joined Fleetwood Mac in 1970, just after marrying Fleetwood Mac bass guitarist John McVie. She had already contributed backup vocals, played keyboards, and painted the cover for Kiln House. The band had just lost founding member Peter Green and its members were nervous about touring without him. McVie had been a huge fan of the Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac, and since she knew all the lyrics to their songs, she went along. McVie quickly became an essential member of the group, and the author of some of its finest songs, a position she would continue to hold for nearly 25 years.\\n\\nThe early \\'70s was a rocky time for the band, with a revolving door of musicians, and only the albums Mystery To Me and Bare Trees scoring any successes, not to mention that a group impersonating Fleetwood Mac was touring the United States without their permission. John McVie\\'s alcohol drinking became unbearable; Christine had an affair with a music producer, and she nearly left John and the band to make a solo album with her lover. However, he went back to his spouse, so she did the same.\\n\\nIn 1974, Christine McVie reluctantly agreed to move with the rest of the band to the US and make a fresh start. Within a year, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham of Buckingham Nicks joined the band. They breathed new life into the music. Their first album together, 1975\\'s Fleetwood Mac, had several hit songs, with McVie\\'s \"Over My Head\" and \"Say You Love Me\" both reaching Billboard\\'s top-20 singles chart.\\n\\nIn 1976, McVie began an on-the-road affair with the band\\'s lighting director, which inspired her to write \"You Make Loving Fun\", a top-10 hit on the landmark smash Rumours, one of the best-selling albums of all-time. Her biggest hit was \"Don\\'t Stop\", which climbed all the way to #3 and has become identified forever as the song Bill Clinton played on the Presidential campaign trail and at his 1993 Inaugural Gala (McVie and the others performed there, as well as at the Super Bowl a few days later).\\n\\nBy the end of the Rumours tour, the McVies had divorced. The 1979 double album Tusk produced three more top-20 hits (\"Tusk,\" \"Sara,\" and \"Think About Me\"), but it was considered a disappointment since practically nothing could top the success of the Rumours album. The group reunited three years later to record Mirage, which contained the top-5 hit \"Hold Me\". \"Hold Me\" was also the band\\'s first music video; McVie\\'s inspiration for the song was her tortured relationship with Beach Boys member Dennis Wilson. Wilson drowned in an accident a few years later, breaking McVie\\'s heart.\\n\\nIn 1984, McVie decided to take a risk and to record a solo album, as most of the other band members had done. She created hits with the songs \"Got a Hold on Me\" (Top 10 pop and #1 adult contemporary) and \"Love Will Show Us How\". The synthesizer-heavy tracks were viewed by some as somewhat jarring in contrast to the crisp and clear singing tones of McVie. Nevertheless, McVie is quoted in The Billboard Book of Number One Adult Contemporary Hits as saying of her solo album, \"Maybe it isn\\'t the most adventurous album in the world, but I wanted to be honest and please my own ears with it.\"\\n\\nShe also met keyboardist Eddy Quintela (12 years her junior), whom she married in October 1986. They divorced a decade later. In the meantime, they wrote several songs together, two of which, \"Little Lies\" and \"As Long As You Follow,\" became hits for Fleetwood Mac.\\n\\nAfter covering the Elvis Presley standard \"Can\\'t Help Falling In Love With You\" for the Howie Mandel film A Fine Mess, she rejoined Fleetwood Mac to record the Tango in the Night album. Her voice had never been better and she had one of her hits, and one of the more widely played songs of the era, \"Little Lies\".\\n\\nIn 1990 the band, minus Lindsey Buckingham, recorded Behind the Mask, but the sales were sluggish and the singles were only marginally successful. McVie had always been reluctant to go on concert tours, preferring to stay close to home with friends and family. Upon the death of her father, Cyril Perfect, that year, during the Behind The Mask tour, McVie made the decision to retire from touring altogether. Despite the departure of Stevie Nicks, McVie remained loyal to Mick Fleetwood and her former husband, recording five songs for the band\\'s 1995 effort Time. The album, which suffered from a lack of publicity and was created by a lineup unfamiliar to the public, was a flop.\\n\\nThe members of the band seemed to have gone their separate ways until Christine McVie, John McVie, Mick Fleetwood, and Lindsey Buckingham got together again for one of Lindsey Buckingham\\'s solo projects. They persuaded Christine to record and tour with them one last time. The live album, 1997\\'s The Dance, went to #1 on the charts. McVie complied with their touring schedule, and then performed for the group\\'s 1998 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as well as the Grammy Awards show, and the Brit Awards. Thereafter, she retired from Fleetwood Mac altogether.\\n\\nIn the years after The Dance, Christine McVie stepped out of public view almost completely. In 2000 she did, however, appear in public to receive an Honorary Doctorate in Music from the University of Greenwich, England. Some years later, in December 2003, she went to see Fleetwood Mac\\'s last UK performance on the Say You Will tour in London, but did not join her former bandmates on the stage.\\n\\nMid-2004 saw the release of McVie\\'s new solo album, \"In the Meantime\", her third in a career spanning five decades. Recorded in her converted barn in Kent, England, McVie worked on the project with her nephew, Dan Perfect, who contributed guitar-playing, back-up vocals, and songwriting. There was no tour to accompany this album, though McVie consented to a limited number of press interviews in the UK and the USA. Prior to her death on 30 November 2022 at the age of 79 (after a short illness), McVie lived in the south of England and rarely left her countryside home. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Christine+McVie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Also known as the \"C And C Boys\", the blind duo made seven singles, the last of which was recorded at Fame\\'s Muscle Shoals studio. When his partner, Calvin Thomas (aka Scott), suffered serious injuries in a car accident in 1966, Carter became a solo act (Calvin himself later reappeared as a solo act to record two Dave Crawford-produced Atco Records singles in 1969/70 and a Clarence Paul-produced 1971 album for Stax Records, I\\'m Not Blind ... I Just Can\\'t See, from which two singles were also taken). \"Tell Daddy\", released in January 1967, began a fruitful spell of Fame-produced hits by Carter, released on the Atlantic Records label. Noteworthy were \"Thread The Needle\", \"Looking For A Fox\" and \"Slip Away\", where the singer combined his outstanding voice with his skill as an arranger and musician.\\n\\n\"Patches\", first recorded by Chairmen Of The Board, was a UK number 2 and a US number 4 in 1970, but despite further strong offerings, Clarence was unable to sustain the momentum. He remained with Fame until 1973, where he also helped guide Candi Staton, who was now his wife, before moving to ABC Records the subsequent year.\\n\\nFurther recordings on Venture and Big C took Carter\\'s career into the 1980s and later the artist found a sympathetic outlet with the Ichiban Records label. Despite being blinded as a child, he developed a distinctive guitar style that complemented his earthy delivery, and was just as comfortable on keyboards, writing songs or arranging sessions. The first two albums, This Is Clarence Carter and The Dynamic Clarence Carter show off his versatile talent to good effect.\\n\\nClarence returned in the late Eighties with the album Dr. CC, which spawned the bawdy, comedic single \"Strokin\\'\", which has evolved into a favorite at clubs and weddings.

Known as \"The Big Man\", Clemons played with Springsteen from 1973 to his death in 2011; his sax parts were an easily recognized feature of the E Street sound, with the most famous being his long, elegiac solo during the song \"Jungleland.\" With the band Clemons plays mostly tenor saxophone, but has also occasionally played soprano and baritone saxophone. He also plays various percussion instruments during songs that do not have a saxophone part.\\n\\nIn addition, Clemons had a larger-than-life persona within the band; he served as a visual foil to Springsteen during concerts (as well as on the Born to Run foldout album cover) and as the crowd favorite is always the last player mentioned during band introductions, usually after a lavish, over-the-top build-up from Springsteen.\\n\\nIn addition to his E Street Band work, Clemons had recorded with many other artists and had a number of musical projects on his own. The best known of these were his 1985 vocal duet with Jackson Browne on the hit single \"You\\'re a Friend of Mine\", and his saxophone work on Aretha Franklin\\'s 1985 hit single \"Freeway of Love\". In the mid-1990s, he recorded a Japan-only CD release called Aja and the Big Man \"Get it On\" (on the now-defunct Dream Train Records) with singer/songwriter Aja Kim (formerly of the tribute band The Iron Maidens). In the 2000s Clemons had worked with a group called The Temple of Soul, and had also recorded with philanthropic teen band Creation. During the 1980s Clemons owned a Red Bank, New Jersey nightclub called Big Man\\'s West.\\n\\nClemons was raised in Norfolk County, Virginia. He attended Maryland State College (now the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore) on a football athletic scholarship — he was a lineman with professional football aspirations until an injury derailed his sports career.\\n\\nClemons appeared in several movies and on television making his debut in Martin Scorsese\\'s 1977 musical, \"New York, New York\" in which he played a trumpet player. He can be seen as one of the Three Most Important People In The World in the 1989 film Bill and Ted\\'s Excellent Adventure. In 1985, Clemons was a special guest star in Diff\\'rent Strokes episode 8x10 \"So You Want to Be a Rock Star\", in which he played the role of Mr. Kingsley, a young saxophonist player helping Arnold Jackson to learn to play his sax. He has also been a guest voice in an episode of The Simpsons. He also played the role of Jack in Swing starring opposite Lisa Stansfield and Hugo Speer, directed by Nick Mead. He appeared alongside Michael McKean and David Bowie as a miner in one episode of musician Weird Al Yankovic\\'s children\\'s television show The Weird Al Show. He appeared in an episode of Damon Wayans\\' television show, My Wife And Kids as a musician and performed an original composition, co written with bassist, Lynn Woolever, called \"One Shadow In The Sun\".

During this period he was also a recording artist, cutting many of his own songs, including \"Nobody But You Babe\".\\n\\nReid wrote sexually explicit versions of hit songs for fun but only performed them for his friends at parties or in the studio. In 1971, he along with a band of studio musicians recorded a whole album of dirty songs under the name Blowfly. The album, The Weird World of Blowfly, features Reid dressed as a low-rent supervillain on its cover. He created this alter ego to protect his career as a songwriter, and continued to perform in bizarre costumes as his Blowfly character and continued to record sexually explicit albums throughout the 1970s/80s. The albums were widely popular as \"party records\". The explicit version of his song \"Rapp Dirty\" (a.k.a. \"Blowfly\\'s Rapp\") helped the album Blowfly\\'s Party reach #26 on Billboard magazine\\'s Black Albums chart and #82 on the Billboard Top 200 in 1980.\\nBlowfly\\'s profane style earned Reid legal trouble. He was sued by songwriter Stanley Adams, who was ASCAP president at the time, for spoofing \"What a Diff\\'rence a Day Makes\" as \"What a Difference a Lay Makes\". Reid\\'s own compositions have been sampled by dozens of hip hop, R&B, and electronic artists (such as Beyonce, Wu Tang Clan, DJ Quik, DMX, Method Man & Redman, Main Source, DJ Shadow, Eazy-E, RJD2, Jurassic 5, Big Daddy Kane, Mary J. Blige, Brand Nubian, and the Avalanches) but Reid has received almost no money from sampling due to signing away most of his royalties.\\nAfter 17 years of sporadic touring and occasional re-recording of his classic raps, Blowfly signed with Jello Biafra\\'s independent record label Alternative Tentacles in 2005. Fahrenheit 69, the first album under the new contract, featured appearances from Slug of Atmosphere, King Coleman, Gravy Train, and Afroman.\\nBlowfly\\'s Punk Rock Party, a 2006 album release from Alternative Tentacles, features several punk rock classics given the Blowfly treatment—including a rewrite of the Dead Kennedys song \"Holiday in Cambodia\" recast as \"R. Kelly in Cambodia\", which features Biafra (the song\\'s composer and original singer) playing a trial judge. Blowfly completed his first tour of Australia in March 2007, and toured Germany with Die Ärzte in 2008. He performed at the 2010 Big Day Out music festival, held in Australia and New Zealand.\\nThe Weird World of Blowfly, directed by Jonathan Furmanski, premiered at South by Southwest in 2010 and received a wider release in September 2011.\\n\\nOn January 12, 2016, Blowfly drummer \"Uncle\" Tom Bowker announced in a statement on the Blowfly Facebook page that Reid was suffering from terminal liver cancer and had been admitted to a hospice facility in Florida. According to Bowker, the singer will release his final LP – entitled 77 Trombones – in February of 2016.\\n\\nOn January 17, 2016, a further update to the Blowfly Facebook page announced Reid\\'s death.\\n\\nReid\\'s daughter is former WNBA player Tracy Reid.\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Clarence+Reid\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Barzotti moved back to Belgium at the age of 18, settling in the town of Court-Saint-Étienne. Barzotti began his musical career in France in 1981 with his song \"Madame,\" which sold 400,000 copies. However, later in the year, Barzotti found widespread success with his song \"Le Rital,\" which propelled him to household-name status.\\n\\n\"Rital\" is a difficult to translate French slang term used to refer in a derogatory sense to people of Italian descent, the song deals with Barzotti\\'s experiences as a young child and how \"he wanted to be named Dupont (a common French surname),\" but the song also deals with his pride concerning the term, exemplified in lines such as \"Je suis rital et je le reste,\" which translates to \"I\\'m Italian and will so remain.\" Barzotti\\'s career contained throughout the 1980\\'s, and his last major successful song was in 1990\\'s \"Aime-moi\" (English:Love Me), at which point many people believed his career was far from over. Although Barzotti profited from the wave of nostalgia which gripped France at the turn of the 21st century, he was unable to capture the musical prominence he had once held. Because of his distinctive voice and great successes in the French music industry, he is considered one of the most prominent French pop musicians of the 1980s.

       " 'The son of an Italian mother and a French father, Claude François was born in Ismaïlia, Egypt, where his father, Aimé François, was working as a shipping traffic controller on the Suez Canal. In 1951 the job took the family to the city of Port Tawfik on the Red Sea.\\n\\nClaude François’ mother was very musical and had her son take piano and violin lessons. On his own, the boy learned to play the drums. As a result of the 1956 Suez Crisis, the family returned to live in Monaco, where they struggled financially after Claude’s father fell ill and could not work. A young Claude found a job as a bank clerk and at night earned extra money playing drums with an orchestra at the luxury hotels along the French Riviera. With a good but untested singing voice, he was offered a chance to sing at a hotel in the fashionable Mediterranean resort town of Juan-les-Pins. His show was well received and eventually he began to perform at the glamorous night-clubs along the Côte d’Azur. While working the clubs, he met Janet Woolcoot, an English dancer whom he married in 1960.\\n\\nAmbitious, Claude François moved to Paris, where there were many more opportunities to pursue his career. At the time, American Rock and Roll was taking hold in France and he took a job as part of a singing group in order to make a living. With the goal of eventually making it as a solo act, he paid the cost to record a 45rpm. Trying to capitalize on the American dance craze « The Twist », Claude François recorded a song titled « Nabout Twist » that proved a resounding failure. Undaunted, in 1962 he recorded a cover version in French of an Everly Brothers song, « Made to Love » (aka Girls Girls Girls). Written by Phil Everly, it had been only a minor hit in America, but Claude François’ rendition titled « Belles Belles Belles » rocked to the top of the French charts, selling close to two million copies and making him an overnight star.\\n\\nUnder a new manager, Claude François’ career continued to blossom. In 1963 he followed the first success with another French adaptation of an American song. This time, doing Trini Lopez’s « If I Had a Hammer » in French as « Si j’avais un marteau ». Claude François met Michel Bourdais who was working for the well-known French magazine “Salut les Copains” in English as « Hi Buddies ». He liked the rigor and the precision of Michel’s drawings and asked him to draw his portrait. This drawing has remained very famous until now. Capitalizing on his blond good looks, he mimicked Elvis Presley’s stage style as well as the slicked-back hair. Performing in sequined suits, François gave high-energy stage performances that had hordes of adoring teenage fans racing to the music shops to purchase his latest record or lining up to buy a ticket for his shows.\\n\\nIn 1964 he headlined at the Paris Olympia, a sign that he had arrived. At the end of that year Claude François created original new dance steps and Michel Bourdais drew them. For the first time, they brought up the idea of setting-up a show with female dancers. In January 1965, while returning from a trip to Las Vegas, Claude Francois fascinated by the American shows decided to take them as a model and eventually the project of performing on the stage with a female dancer band became clear in his mind.\\n\\nA dedicated professional, Claude François worked hard to achieve success producing a string of massively popular hit songs and touring constantly. With the onslaught of Beatlemania, he covered their hits in French, adjusted the hair style a little and kept his success moving ahead. But his talent extended beyond copying the works others had made famous, and he wrote songs for himself and displayed a melodic voice doing romantic ballads.\\n\\nIn 1966, François created a complete new stage act using four female dancers as backup. Named « Les Clodettes, » the sexy girls danced in the background while François did his own energetic work center stage. In a return to the Paris Olympia he added eight musicians and a full orchestra to his backup dancers, putting on a spectacular show that filled every seat in the large theater and left fans standing in the street for lack of tickets.\\n\\nDivorced from his wife, in 1967 he began a relationship with France Gall, another famous French singer. Their affair was short lived and he soon met Isabelle Forêt, with whom he had two sons in two years. Flushed with enormous success and confidence, he established his own record company. In 1968, he and Jacques Revaux wrote a song in French called Comme d’habitude, which became a hit in francophone countries. The song was inspired by his recent break-up with France Gall. Canadian singing star Paul Anka reworked it for the English-speaking public into the now legendary hit most famously sung by Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra as « My Way ». Although Claude François continued his successful formula of adapting English and American rock and roll hits for the French market, by the 1970s the market had changed and the disco craze that swept North America took root in France. For the versatile François, this was not a problem. He simply re-invented himself as the king of French disco, recording « La plus belle des choses, » a French version of a Bee Gees hit record.\\n\\nHe worked non-stop, touring across Europe, Africa and at major venues in Quebec in Canada. However, his workload caught up with him in 1971 when he collapsed on stage from exhaustion. After a brief period off, he returned to the recording studios, releasing several best-selling hits throughout the early 1970s. He expanded from owning his own record company to acquiring a celebrity magazine and a modeling agency. Although driven to achieve financial success, in 1974 he organized a concert to raise funds for a charity for handicapped children and the following year he participated in a Paris concert to raise funds for medical research. By the mid-1970s he was single again, dating several well-known European stars. He continued to perform while overseeing his numerous business interests. In 1975, while in London, he narrowly escaped death when an IRA bomb exploded and two years later a fan tried to shoot him. In 1977 and 1978, more than 15 years after his first hit record, he was still topping the musical charts with multi-million sales from hits such as « Alexandrie Alexandra » and performing to large audiences.\\n\\nAfter working in Switzerland, on Saturday, March 11, 1978 he returned to his Paris apartment in order to appear the next day on « Rendez-vous du Dimanche » with TV host Michel Drucker. His demise was caused by his obsession with cleanliness and order. He was accidentally electrocuted when he tried to fix a broken light bulb while standing in a filled bathtub. At only 39 years of age, his early death brought a wave of public sympathy for a national French star.\\n\\nClaude François owned a home near the village of Dannemois in the Essonne departement about 35 miles south of Paris. It was a place where he liked to escape to relax in the quiet countryside and it was there that he was interred in the local cemetery.\\n\\nOn March 11, 2000, on the 22nd anniversary of his death, Place Claude-François in Paris was named in his memory, right in front of the building where he died.\\n\\nIn 2004 the movie \\'Podium\\' was released. It\\'s a story about a Claude François impersonator (played by Benoît Poelvoorde).\\n\\nHis hits include Alexandrie, Alexandra; Cette Année-la; Je vais à Rio. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Claude+Fran%C3%A7ois\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

After the decline of Disco in the U.S., she continued to have success in the Club/Dance music market. Both her Rock edged Dance Pop album, \"Feel The Fire\" (1980) and the Hi-NRG album, \"Made In Hong Kong\" became successful in the Club/Dance music market in the U.S. By the mid 1980s, she reinvented her sounds with more Hi-NRG output.

       " 'Clay Aiken (born on November 30, 1978) is a popular American singer who rose to fame on the American Idol television program, and who has become the most successful second-place finisher in that show\\'s history, even handily eclipsing that year\\'s \"Idol\" winner in sales.  His first single, \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\"/ \"This Is The Night\" debuted at Number One, and became the best-selling single of the year — and he was just getting started.\\n\\nClay\\'s first CD, Measure of a Man (Number One, Top 200), went triple platinum selling more than 613,000 copies in its first week. Including singles like \"Invisible\", \"The Way,\" \"I Will Carry You\" and the Neil Sedaka cover \"Solitaire,\" it was the subject of conflicting reviews. Billboard Magazine called it the best pop album of 2003. Many fans and some critics recognized and admired the pure pop sound (\"so pure it floats\") and top-notch production values while others heard only a manufactured sound, noting that the singer hadn\\'t earned his musical chops but \"merely\" sang his way to the hearts of millions on television, a perceived unjust leap-frogging of \"the true path of the true artist.\"  \\n\\nAiken fronted a country band, Just By Chance, pre-Idol and recorded 3 demo CDs. As a young man he was a member of the Raleigh Boy\\'s Choir and was in numerous musical productions in North Carolina Theater. \\n\\nThe National Inclusion Project (formerly the Bubel/Aiken Foundation) was launched in 2003, supporting the integration of children with disabilities into the life environment of their non-disabled peers. In November 2004, Clay was appointed as a National Ambassador for UNICEF, with a mission to help ensure that children everywhere are afforded a primary education.\\n\\nIn November 2004, Clay released Merry Christmas With Love (Number One, Top 200). His first Christmas album, it went platinum, won 2 Billboard Music Awards and spurred a yearly holiday tour and a follow-up EP, All Is Well - Songs for Christmas.  2004 was also the year Clay made #2 on the New York Times Best Seller List with his \"inspirational memoir\" titled Learning to Sing: Hearing the Music in Your Life. \\n\\nHis next studio album, 2006\\'s A Thousand Different Ways (Number Two, Top 200), was, through the direction of mega-producer Clive Davis, largely a covers CD. Ten of the fourteen cuts being well known melodic pop songs ranging from Richard Marx, Bryan Adams, Dolly Parton, Mister Mister, and Elton John.  Two other songs, available only on digital versions of the album, are \"If You Don\\'t Know Me By Now\" (through K-Mart.com) and \"Lover All Alone\" (through iTunes and co-written by Aiken himself).  Many fans have wondered about the relative exclusion of the latter song, left languishing from the song list present on the physical CD, as its intimate emotional material and Aiken\\'s own writing handiwork produce a spellbinding effect.  \\n\\nIn May of 2008 Aiken released On My Way Here (Number Four, Top 200), his first album of original material since his 2003 chart-topping debut Measure of A Man. While searching for songs for this album, he fell in love with a song written by OneRepublic front man Ryan \"Alias\" Tedder called \"On My Way Here.\" The message of the lyrics -- how the lessons we learn while growing up shape us into who we become as adults -- struck such a deep chord with Clay that it wound up inspiring the theme (and title) of his new collection. In addition to enlisting Grammy-Award winning British songwriter and producer Kipper, On My Way Here also included the talented musicians of none other then the Steely Dan band. \\n\\nA fifth album, The Very Best of Clay Aiken, was released at the end of March 2009 on Sony\\'s Legacy Recordings Playlist Series.\\n\\nTo date, Aiken has headlined 8 tours., one of them co-headlining with Kelly Clarkson.\\n\\nAiken made his Broadway debut playing the role of Sir Robin in Monty Python\\'s Spamalot in January 2008. His first run ended in May. He rejoined the cast as Sir Robin in September and remained through January 4, 2009.\\n\\nIn August of 2008 Clay became a father to Parker Foster Aiken with producer Jaymes Foster, the sister of record producer David Foster. \\n\\nClay will release a brand new album, titled \"Tried and True\", on June 1, 2010 on the Decca Records label.\\n\\nClay also has made numerous TV appearances, guest-starring on everything from Scrubs to Days of Our Lives to the season finale of the popular show 30 Rock. He has earned a place on such talk-shows as Jimmy Kimmel Live, The Tonight Show, Late Night With David Letterman, Tyra Banks, Rachel Ray, Ellen and has cooked with both Martha Stewart and Paula Deen.\\n\\nThough clearly, based on his television and concert appeal, a performing artist whose live presentations show consummate showmanship, bringing surprising dynamism to studio songs, Aiken has had to endure a persistent hammering from entertainment critics and a tenacious (not to say malevolent) interest on the part of some in the media relating to questions about his personal life.\\n\\nAlways full of surprises, fans look forward to the continued ways in which this multi-talented artist expresses himself and uses his voice in ways that will expand his appeal in and beyond the US.\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Clay+Aiken\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'With his first two singles reaching number one upon their release, Clay Walker immediately established himself as a commercial success. Unlike most of his new country contemporaries of the mid-\\'90s, he was able to sustain that success over a couple of years, racking up no less than five number one singles in the first three years of his career. \\n\\nClay Walker (born August 19, 1969) was born and raised on a farm in Beaumont, TX, the hometown of George Jones. Walker fell in love with country music at an early age, when his father gave him a guitar when he was only nine years old. After he graduated from high school, Walker pursued a musical career full-time, playing concerts across the South, the Midwest, and Canada. For over three years, he toured and went to school, taking courses about the music business. During this time, he acted as his own manager. Eventually, he became the house singer at the Neon Armadillo bar in Beaumont. While performing at the club, producer James Stroud heard Walker and offered to work with the singer. Stroud helped Walker secure a contract with Giant Records, and the pair began working on the vocalist\\'s debut album.\\n\\n\"What\\'s It to You\" became a number one hit upon its release in August of 1993, with \"Live Until I Die\" following it into the pole position later that same year. Both singles were featured on his debut album, Clay Walker, which was released in the fall of 1993. \"Where Do I Fit in the Picture,\" the third single from the album, became a number 11 hit in early 1994. \"White Palace\" was a flop, failing to crack the Top 40, but \"Dreaming With My Eyes Open\" became his third number one hit in the summer of 1994, helping make his debut record a platinum album. If I Could Make a Living was not quite as successful as his debut, yet it still yielded the number one title track. Hypnotize the Moon, Walker\\'s third album, appeared in the fall of 1995, preceded by the number two single \"Who Needs You Baby.\" He followed with Self Portrait in 1996 and Rumor Has It in 1997. A Greatest Hits collection appeared in 1998 and a new album, Live, Laugh, Love, was released in 1999.

He was raised in a religious Baptist family, and formed a gospel group in 1945 after his family moved to New Jersey. They soon relocated to New York City, and McPhatter joined the Mount Lebanon Singers, a popular gospel group.\\n\\nIn 1950, McPhatter joined Billy Ward & the Dominoes, and was present for the recording of \"Sixty Minute Man\", which was a huge hit in 1951, and was one of the earliest rock and roll records. After several more hits, McPhatter quit the group in 1953 because he made little money and gained virtually no fame, in spite of his voice being the lead on most of the group\\'s songs. McPhatter then signed to Atlantic Records after forming a group, The Drifters. \"Money Honey\", \"Such a Night\", \"Honey Love\", \"White Christmas\" and \"Whatcha Gonna Do\" became huge hits.\\n\\nIn 1954, McPhatter was drafted but was assigned in the U.S., allowing him to continue recording. He soon left The Drifters and launched a solo career. His first solo hit occurred just after being discharged - \"Love Has Joined Us Together\" (with Ruth Brown). He released several R&B hits in the next few years, but only made one serious dent in the pop charts with the Brook Benton penned song \"A Lovers Question\", which made it to #6 in 1958. White groups usually covered his best compositions and achieved more widespread mainstream success. In spite of this, McPhatter became one of the most popular black musicians among white listeners. His 1956 recording of \"Treasure of Love\" saw him enjoy just one week in the UK singles chart. The lack of any subsequent entry gave him the unenviable tag there of being a one hit wonder\\n\\nMcPhatter soon signed to MGM Records, and released several more hits. \"I Told Myself a Lie\" and \"Think Me a Kiss\" (1960) became minor pop hits, as was \"Ta Ta\", his first single for Mercury Records. \"I Never Knew\" and \"Lover Please\" (1962) became even bigger pop hits, but his career started suffering due to his alcoholism. Other black artists were following McPhatter\\'s blueprint into pop audiences, including Rudy Lewis, Johnny Moore, Sam Cooke and an all new line-up of The Drifters. McPhatter\\'s unreliability kept him from maintaining his career in the face of this competition. As the 1960s wore on, McPhatter\\'s career kept falling in spite of a few minor hits.\\n\\nIn the early 1970s, McPhatter spent some time living in England, where he still had a significant audience, but this was short-lived.

       " 'Johnny Hallyday (Jean-Philippe Léo Smet, b. 15 June 1943 in Paris – d. 5 December 2017, in Marnes-la-Coquette) was a French singer and actor. Influenced by Elvis Presley and the 1950s rock \\'n\\' roll revolution, Hallyday became famous in the 1960s for singing rock \\'n\\' roll in French. \\n\\nHallyday\\'s father, Léon Smet (1908–1989), was Belgian; his mother, Huguette Clerc (1920–2007), was French. Born in Paris, Hallyday took his stage name from his aunt Desta\\'s husband and dance partner Lee Hallyday, a pseudonym for Lee Ketcham, an expatriate Oklahoman, performer, and MC at the Café de Paris where Johnny began his singing career. Johnny was raised by Desta and Lee from a very young age, with Lee being his first manager. Johnny was always very loyal to Lee and secured him a permanent job as a producer and A&R man with his label, Philips Records until Lee\\'s retirement and relocation back to Oklahoma.\\n\\nHis debut single, \"Laisse les filles\" was released on the Vogue label in March 1960. His first album, Hello Johnny, was released in 1960. In 1961 his cover of \"Let\\'s Twist Again\" sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. It topped almost every European chart, although the track did not appear in the UK Singles Chart. He appeared on the American The Ed Sullivan Show with American singing star Connie Francis in a show that was taped at the Moulin Rouge nightclub in Paris. He also staged many appearances in the Paris Olympia under the management of the late Bruno Coquatrix. For their first concert, The Jimi Hendrix Experience opened for Johnny Hallyday in Évreux on 13 October 1966. Black-and-white footage, also from October 1966, exists of Hallyday partying with Hendrix, his manager Chas Chandler and others. There also is a widely published monochrome photograph of Hallyday walking somewhere in Paris in late May 1966 with Bob Dylan.\\n\\nAt the end of the 1960s, Hallyday made a string of albums with Mick Jones and Tommy Brown as musical directors, and Big Jim Sullivan, Bobby Graham and Jimmy Page as session musicians. These are Jeune Homme, Rivière... Ouvre ton Lit (a.k.a. Je suis né dans la rue) and Vie. On Je suis né dans la rue, Hallyday also hired both Peter Frampton and the Small Faces. Amongst their contributions are the songs Amen (Bang Bang), Reclamation (News Report), and Regarde Pour Moi (What You Will), which are variations of Small Faces and Humble Pie (Frampton\\'s band) songs—tracks and they all play on the album. Often forgotten is Hallyday\\'s non-LP single and EP track Que Je T\\'aime from the same sessions. By 1969 alone, his sales of records exceeded twelve million.\\n\\nOne of Hallyday\\'s later concerts, 100% Johnny: Live à La Tour Eiffel in 2000, attracted an audience of 500,000 and 9.5 million television viewers (the show was broadcast live on French TV). In December 2005, Hallyday had his third number-one single in France, \"Mon Plus Beau Noël\" (after \"Tous ensemble\" and \"Marie\"), dedicated to his adopted daughter Jade. Shortly before announcing his retirement from touring, he released a blues-flavored album, Le Cœur d\\'un homme, on 12 November 2007. The album hit No. 1 in both France and French-speaking Belgium. In addition to the lead single \"Always\", Le Cœur d\\'un homme features \"T\\'aimer si mal\", a duet with bluesman Taj Mahal and \"I Am the Blues\", an English-language song written for Hallyday by U2\\'s lead singer Bono. His next album, Ça ne finira jamais, released in 2008, another No. 1 on the French album chart, and its lead single, \"Ça n\\'finira jamais\", also reached No. 1. In 2008 he recorded a series of acoustic songs with French musician Drexl Jonez. Hallyday\\'s most recent album, also a No. 1 hit in France, is Tour 66: Stade de France 2009, a live set recorded at Stade de France during his farewell tour with appearances by Drexl Jonez on the guitar.\\n\\nFrench movie producers Michèle and Laurent Pétin introduced Johnny Hallyday to Hong Kong film director Johnnie To. Hallyday was cast as the main role of To\\'s Vengeance after meeting with the director in early 2008.

Cody Johnson\\'s unique blend of Country and Rock does just that.\\nMany Texas Music fans met Cody Johnson’s honest style through the radio singles from his Six Strings, One Dream album: \"Nobody to Blame\" (#6 on the Texas music charts in 2009);  #1\"Pray for Rain\" (2009 - 2010); and \"Texas Kind of Way\" (#6, late 2010 – 2011). \\nAt first opening for other artists, Cody has also taken the Texas dance-halls by storm. Increasingly, the Cody Johnson Band is the attraction, and an honest-to-goodness one.\\nCody’s childhood, though, was different from his rowdy onstage personality. Growing up, home was Sebastopol, a speck on the East Texas piney woods map, the perfect setting for that country boy to roam the woods, hunt, and fish. Home-schooling and family times around the piano provided the kind of life the kind many folks envy. Even Cody\\'s music training started when dad Carl taught him the chords to “I’ll Fly Away,” a  Southern Gospel favorite.\\nStarting public school as a freshmen, Cody expanded beyond playing the guitar and drums at church. When his “ag science” teacher overheard Cody playing an original song, he convinced Cody to form a band with other FFA (Future Farmers of America) members. A few months later, Cody\\'s band placed \"runner-up\" in the highly competitive Texas State FFA talent contest. \\nCody left the contest realizing he was in love for life: in love with the music, the crowd, and the energy of performing onstage. Beginning in small honky-tonks and bars, he tried different musical styles. Discarding many, today Cody\\'s shows still keep a Garth Brooks-level of energy and a Ronnie Van Zant - outlaw dedication to individual style. Like the late Chris LeDoux\\'s musical beginnings, “CoJo” sold his acoustic CDs from the back of his truck during three years of bull-riding. Cody still shows up today as the true cowboy he is.\\nAfter graduation, Johnson worked for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in Huntsville. There, supervising prison inmates, Cody confides, \"I developed an even greater appreciation for family and friends. Seeing how easy it was to go to prison set me on the \\'straight and narrow\\'.\" \\nAlso in Huntsville, Cody met Nathan Reedy, who became his new drummer. With Carl Johnson playing bass, the trio began traveling as the Cody Johnson Band. Their first CD, Black & White Label, provided funding for travel and radio promotion - and the assurance that the music dream was real.\\nAlong the way, several popular artists have shared their friendship, fans and wisdom with Cody. Some had business advice and warned him of issues musicians face on the road. The common thread is that other professionals respect Cody as performer, songwriter and individual. In turn, Cody Johnson earns that respect, giving as much effort to an audience of 30 or 30,000. As he states, “I like the crowd to sing along, yell, or whatever makes them feel part of the show. I love big crowds because of the energy and showmanship I can exhibit. I love acoustic shows because of the intimacy and how candid they are. Acoustic shows are like sittin’ around the living room \\'pickin\\' and grinnin\\'.\"\\nWinning the Texas’ Regional Music Awards as “New Male Vocalist of the Year, 2011,” caused Cody to choose whether leave the security of State employment to chase his dreams. So he followed his own advice to \"Always pray for direction, and know that no matter what..., the good Lord has a plan.\"\\nThe answer to that prayer came when Cody\\'s wife Brandi gave her “thumbs-up.” As Cody puts it, \"When the woman I love - and plan to spend the rest of my life with - told me that she \\'stands by her man\\' and believes in me 100%, I believed even more confidently that I could live my dream. Though I\\'ve had lots of people believe, contribute, push and pull me along, no one\\'s efforts affected my decision emotionally the way Brandi\\'s faith in me did.\"\\nCody indeed left his \"day job\" for the more-than-full-time music career. But, that’swhere the story really begins.\\nExpanding his boundaries beyond Texas, he flew to Nashville to record a new CD with Nashville studio musicians hand-picked by his \"big brother,\" Nashville-based fellow Texan, Trent Willmon, producer of the new album, A Different Day (released October 31,2011). \\nThough new to Nashville recording ways, Johnson’s musical confidence showed in the Music City recording studio. Together, he and the studio musicians tweaked songs to obtain the exact intended effect. Listening to the Music City veterans, Cody adopted suggestions when they felt right, and would \"hang tough\" when he felt the music differently.\\nAccording to CoJo, \"I don\\'t want to be labeled as \\'Texas\\' or \\'Nashville.\\' I am me: Texas, outlaw, cowboy, country, and a God-fearing man using the gift He gave me.\"\\n-Billie Willmon Jenkin  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cody+Johnson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Kardinal Offishall (born Jason Harrow on May 21, 1976 in Scarborough, Ontario) is a Canadian hip-hop MC and producer of Jamaican descent.Kardinal is often viewed as \"Canada\\'s hip-hop ambassador\", and along with MC\\'s such as Saukrates and Maestro Fresh Wes, he\\'s arguably the most popular. Kardinal blends soul, dancehall, reggae and hip-hop to create a truly unique sound.\\n\\nKardinal started rapping at the age of eight, and was winning competitions by the time he was 12. Also at the age of 12, Kardinal performed live and on stage for the first time, with Nelson Mandela in attendance during his first visit to Toronto.[2] By 1993, he decided to drop his alias \"KoolAid\", and went by the moniker Kardinal Offishall after being inspired by the great 17th century French politician Cardinal Richelieu.\\n\\nKardinal was signed to a publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music Canada at the age of 20. In 1996, he released his first single \"Naughty Dread\", which was featured on the Rap Essentials Volume One compilation and earned him a Juno Award nomination for Best Rap Recording. In 1997, Kardinal released his debut album Eye & I on Capitol Hill Music. The only single from the album, \"On Wit Da Show\", had considerable video play on MuchMusic. Kardinal was also credited as a major contributor to the late 90\\'s renaissance of Canadian hip hop. In 1998, he was featured on the Juno-winning single \"Northern Touch\" with the Rascalz, Choclair, Checkmate and Thrust.\\n\\nIn 2000, Kardinal signed with MCA Records. He released the album Quest for Fire: Firestarter, Vol. 1 in 2001, which spawned the hits \"BaKardi Slang\" and \"Ol\\' Time Killin\\'\". The album earned a gold certification in Canada. After MCA folded in 2003, Kardinal\\'s highly anticipated follow up album Firestarter Vol. 2: F Word Theory was shelved along with the single/video for \"Belly Dancer\" featuring Pharrell, and Kardinal eventually found himself without a label. Had the album been released, there would have been production from Timbaland and The Neptunes among others. He released an independent mixtape titled Kill Bloodclott Bill in 2004 with his production company, The Black Jays, and he also released his second major-label album titled Fire and Glory in 2005, through Virgin Records in Canada only. Hits on Fire and Glory include \"Everyday (Rudebwoy)\" and \"Heads Up\".\\n\\nKardinal has also produced many songs, including the hit single \"Let\\'s Ride\" by Choclair, whose album Ice Cold went gold in 35 days and would win them a Juno in 2000. However, it was with the Black Jays team when Kardinal received notoriety for his production work. In 2004, Kardinal and Solitair of the Black Jays created a remix version of Jay-Z\\'s The Black Album and called it The Black Jays Album. Kardinal also did some production on Kill Bloodcott Bill and produced 9.5 out of the 14 tracks on Fire and Glory.\\n\\nHe is one of the few Canadian hip hop artists that have an international audience and has collaborated with artists such as Busta Rhymes, Method Man, Sean Paul, Spragga Benz, Bounty Killer, Little Brother, Stat Quo, Pharoahe Monch, Vybz Kartel, Rihanna, Snow, Pete Rock, Lil Wayne and Akon. A-List producers, The Neptunes requested Kardinal appear on the remix to their smash hit production “Grindin\\'” with Clipse. The remix was well received across North America, particularly in New York City.\\n\\nTo date, Kardinal is the only Canadian urban act to appear on BET’s Rap City (even freestyling in the booth with Big Tigger), and on MTV’s Advance Warning (which introduces the world to artists on the verge of breaking big, like former guest Kanye West). Kardinal has made brief guest appearances in Rihanna\\'s \"Pon De Replay\" music video, and Sean Paul\\'s \"Get Busy\" video, which was shot in Woodbridge, Ontario (a Toronto suburb). He has also appeared on mixtapes from Clinton Sparks and DJ Green Lantern.\\n\\nIn 2006, Kardinal collaborated Akon, Cipha Sounds, DJ Whoo Kid, and various members of the Black Jays family among others. At the 2006 MuchMusic Video Awards, Kardinal walked away with 3 awards for \"Everyday (Rudebwoy)\", including Best Video, Best Director (RT!) and VideoFACT Award. At the MMVA\\'s, he announced that he had an upcoming collaboration with the Canadian Reggae Band Bedouin Soundclash, now known as the single \"Last Standing Soldier\" (Remix).\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kardinal+Offishall\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Not yet out of his teens, Legend was tapped to play piano on Lauryn Hill\\'s \"Everything Is Everything\" in 1998. After completing college, he moved to New York, where he began to build a loyal following playing in nightclubs and releasing CDs that he would sell at shows. He also became an in-demand session musician, playing and occasionally writing for a wide array of artists, including Alicia Keys, Twista, Janet Jackson, and Kanye West. It wasn\\'t until West signed the young talent to his new label that he adopted the Legend name with 2004\\'s Solo Sessions Vol. 1: Live at the Knitting Factory.

       " 'Thomas \"Tom\" Neuwirth (born 6 November 1988), better known as the drag persona Conchita Wurst, is an Austrian singer. Wurst represented Austria and won the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The singer uses female pronouns for herself when in the role of Wurst.\\n\\nNeuwirth states that she was born in Gmunden, Austria, in 1988.. He also revealed in an interview in 2013 that she was frequently scared of being bullied in school for being different, even to the point that he would \\'avoid going to the school\\'s toilets during breaks\\'. Before taking up a drag persona Neuwirth worked as a shop window decorator, but first appeared in public media in an advertisement in 2006.\\n\\nIn 2007 Neuwirth reached the final of the 2007 Austrian casting show Starmania. In 2011 Neuwirth returned to television in drag as \"Conchita Wurst\", a persona created in response to the experiences from his earlier life: \"This is about an important message, it\\'s call for tolerance for everything that seems different\" Neuwirth commented in an interview.

       " 'Nat \"King\" Cole (March 17th 1919–February 15th  1965) was a popular American singer and jazz musician. \\n\\nAs a piano player, he formed a jazz trio in 1938 that played Los Angeles nightclubs, one of the first jazz trios featuring guitar and piano. Prior to this he had played music since he was a child and had worked with bands since he was sixteen. He was raised in Chicago and exposed to the abundant jazz scene there. He was heavily influenced by pianist Earl \"Fatha\" Hines.\\n\\nLater he became more popularly known as a singer and crooner and his work became more orchestrated.\\n\\nHis first mainstream vocal hit was in 1944 with Straighten Up and Fly Right, based on a black folk tale that his father had used as a theme for a sermon. Although hardly a rocker, the song\\'s success proved that an audience for folk-based material existed. It is considered a predecessor to the first rock and roll records. Indeed, Bo Diddley, who performed similar transformations of folk material, counted Cole as an influence.\\n\\nBeginning in the late 1940s, Cole began recording and performing more pop-oriented material for mainstream audiences, often accompanied by a string orchestra. His stature as a popular icon was cemented during this period with such hits as The Christmas Song (1946), Nature Boy (1948), Mona Lisa (1950), and his signature tune Unforgettable (1951). While this shift to pop music led some jazz critics and fans to accuse Cole of selling out, he never totally abandoned his musical roots; as late as 1956, for instance, he recorded an all-jazz album, After Midnight. In 1991, Mosaic Records released the Complete Nat King Cole Trio Recordings on Capitol, which contained 349 songs on twenty-seven LPs or eighteen CDs.\\n\\nThroughout the 1950s Cole continued to rack up hit after hit, including Smile, Pretend, A Blossom Fell, and If I May. Most of his pop hits were collaborations with famed arranger/conductor Nelson Riddle. It was with Riddle that Cole released his first ten-inch long-play album in 1953 entitled Sings for Two in Love. Several more albums followed, including the Gordon Jenkins arranged Love Is the Thing, which reached number one on the album charts in April 1957.\\n\\nInspired by a trip to Havana, Cuba in 1958, Nat went back there that same year and recorded Cole Espanol, an album sung entirely in Spanish and Portuguese. The album was a hit not only in the U.S., but in Latin America as well. The album was so popular, that two others followed: A mis amigos in 1959, and More Cole Espanol in 1962.\\n\\nMusical tastes were changing in the late 1950s, and despite a successful stab at rock n\\' roll with Send for Me, Cole\\'s ballad singing had grown old to younger listeners. Like contemporaries Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, Nat found that the pop singles chart had been almost entirely taken over by youth oriented acts. In 1960, Nat\\'s longtime collaborator Nelson Riddle, left Capitol Records for Frank Sinatra\\'s newly formed Reprise Records label. The two parted ways with one final hit album Wild Is Love, based on lyrics by Ray Rasch and Dotty Wayne. Nat would later re-tool the concept album into an off-Broadway production called I\\'m With You.\\n\\nAs the 1960s progressed, Nat once again found success on the American singles chart, starting with the country/pop flavored hit Ramblin\\' Rose in August of 1962. Three more hit singles followed: Dear Lonely Hearts, Those Lazy, Hazy, Crazy Days of Summer, and That Sunday, That Summer. Nat\\'s final album was entitled L.O.V.E, and was recorded in late 1964. It was released just prior to his death and reached number four on the Billboard Albums chart in the spring of 1965. A \"Best Of\" album went gold in 1968. His 1957 song When I Fall in Love was a chart topping hit for the U.K. in 1987.\\n\\nCole was the first African-American to have his own radio program. He repeated that success in the late-1950s with the first truly national television show starring an African-American. In both cases, the programs were ultimately canceled because sponsors shied away from a black artist. Cole fought racism all his life, refusing to perform in segregated venues. In 1956, he was attacked on stage in Birmingham, Alabama by members of the White Citizens\\' Council who apparently were attempting to kidnap him. Despite injuries, Cole completed the show but vowed never to perform in the South again.\\n\\nOn 23rd August 1956, Cole spoke at the Republican National Convention in the Cow Palace, San Francisco, California. He was also present at the Democratic National Convention in 1960, to throw his support behind President John F. Kennedy. Cole was also among the dozens of entertainers recruited by Frank Sinatra to perform at the Kennedy Inaugural gala in 1961. Nat King Cole frequently consulted with President Kennedy (and later President Johnson) on the issue of civil rights. Yet he was dogged by critics, who felt he shied away from controversy when it came to the civil rights issue. Among the most notable was Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, who was upset that Cole didn\\'t take stronger action after the 1956 on-stage attack.\\n\\nIn 1948, Cole purchased a house in the all-white Hancock Park neighborhood in Los Angeles, California. The property owners association told Cole they didn\\'t want any undesirables moving in, to which Cole retorted \"Neither do I. And if I see anybody undesirable coming in here, I\\'ll be the first to complain.\"\\n\\nHe and his second wife, Maria Ellington, were married in Harlem\\'s Abyssinian Baptist Church by Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. They had five children, including twin girls. Daughter Carol Cole, and son Kelly Cole were adopted. Kelly Cole died in 1995. Nat\\'s daughter, Natalie Cole, and his younger brother, Freddie Cole are also singers.\\n\\nNatalie and her father had an unexpected hit in the summer of 1991. The younger Cole mixed a 1961 recording of her father\\'s rendition of Unforgettable with her own voice, creating an electronic duet. Both the song and the album of the same name won several Grammy awards the following year.\\n\\nCole performed in many short films, and played W. C. Handy in the film Saint Louis Blues. He also appeared in The Nat King Cole Story, China Gate, and The Blue Gardenia.\\n\\nNat King Cole was a heavy smoker of Kool menthol cigarettes, believing that smoking up to three packs a day gave his voice the rich sound it had (Cole would smoke several cigarettes in rapid succession before a recording for this very purpose). Cole died of lung cancer at St. John\\'s Hospital in Santa Monica, California, on 15th February 1965. His funeral was held at St. Victor\\'s Catholic Church in West Hollywood, and he was buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. Cat Ballou, his final film, was released several months later. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Conway Twitty\\'s across the board totals were greater than that of Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, the Beatles, and Garth Brooks.

(Harold Lloyd Jenkins would always remain his legal name, however). Looking at a road map, he spotted Conway, Arkansas and Twitty, Texas. Thus, he went with the professional name of \"Conway Twitty\".[citation needed]\\n\\nAlternatively, Jenkins met a Richmond, VA, man named W. Conway Twitty Jr. through Jenkins\\' manager in a New York City restaurant. The manager served in the army with the real Conway Twitty. Later, the manager suggested to Jenkins that he take the name as his stage name because it had a ring to it. The Richmond Conway Twitty subsequently recorded the song, \"What\\'s in a Name But Trouble,\" in the mid-1960s, lamenting the loss of his name to Jenkins. The flip side of the 45 RPM record was \"The Purple, Purple People Eater, Eater.\" (The more well known version of Purple People Eater, however, now having sold over 100,000,000 copies, was recorded by Sheb Wooley.) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Conway+Twitty\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Corinne Bailey Rae (born Corinne Bailey on 26 February 1979) is a Grammy-winning English singer and songwriter who released her eponymous debut album \"Corinne Bailey Rae\" in February 2006. Rae was named the number-one predicted breakthrough act of 2006 in an annual BBC poll of music critics.\\n\\nRae was born in Leeds, West Yorkshire to a Kittitian father and an English mother, and she was the eldest of three daughters. She began her musical career at school where she studied classical violin before she turned her attention to singing: \"I started off singing in church, I suppose, but people think it must have been a gospel church because of the whole, you know, black assumption\", she says in reference to her multiracial background. \"But it wasn\\'t gospel at all, it was just your regular Brethren church, very middle-class, where we would sing these harmonies every Sunday. It was always my favourite part of the service, the singing\".\\n\\nRae later transferred to a Baptist church, where the choir would sing traditional hymns, and Primal Scream tunes. \"We changed the words though\", Rae states on her website. \"We didn\\'t want to offend the regular churchgoers, now did we?\"\\n\\nPerforming in church broadened Rae\\'s musical horizons, and her love affair with making music was solidified after a local youth leader offered to buy her an electric guitar. In her mid-teens, she became obsessed with rock legends Led Zeppelin, \"I loved that band during my teens; I wanted, somehow, to follow in their footsteps, and to create music of my own\".\\n\\nRae formed an all-female indie group called Helen, which was inspired by similar acts such as Veruca Salt and L7. \"It was the first time I\\'d seen women with guitars. They were kinda sexy – but feminist. I wanted to be like that, at the front of something\".\\n\\nThe group raised eyebrows on several fronts; in the white male-dominated world of indie music, they were an all-female group fronted by a mixed-race singer from Leeds. The moniker \"Helen\" also drew attention, albeit for not all the right reasons: \"What can I say? We were 15 years old, and thought that Helen was a cheeky, indie kind of thing to do. It seemed clever at the time. Admittedly, it seems less so now\".\\n\\nThe group played many gigs around Leeds, including a memorable performance at Joseph\\'s Well with Leeds-based band Swift, fronted by wildman rocker Royce Dunston. Despite this, the group became the first indie act to be signed to heavy metal record label Roadrunner Records, home to acts such as Slipknot, in 1995. The venture proved to be short-lived however after the bassist became pregnant and the group disbanded. \"[Was I] Disappointed? I was gutted! I had no idea what to do next\".\\n\\nCorinne has often stated that she is a proud Leeds United Football Club fan. \\n\\nAfter the disappointment of Helen, Rae went on to attend the University of Leeds where she studied an English Literature degree. While at University, she began work as a hat check girl on an evening in her local jazz club. Permitted to sing on stage with the jazz band when business was slow, it was there that she discovered a different type of music that sent her on a different musical path: \"I kept hearing this jazz and soul stuff and I realized I loved that music too\". It was there also that she met saxophone player Jason Rae, whom she eventually married in 2001 at age twenty-two. \"I was Corinne Bailey. I added on Rae, my husband\\'s name, when I got married. There\\'s no hyphen; stops it being posh!\" Jason died in March 2008.\\n\\nCareer\\n\\nOver the space of the next three years, Rae began working on solo material – this time steering away from her indie past and embarking on a more \"soulful\" path. She collaborated with Leeds-based funk group The New Mastersounds on the track \"Your Love Is Mine\", featured on their 2003 album Be Yourself, released via One Note Records. The following year she again worked with another Leeds-based group, Homecut Directive, on the song \"Come the Revolution\", which was the first single from the group\\'s debut album.\\n\\nIn 2004, Rae got a breakthrough when she was signed by Global Talent Publishing and then approached by Craig David\\'s mentor Mark Hill, from the duo The Artful Dodger, to appear on his new album better luck next time under his new alias, The stiX. The resulting collaboration, \"Young and Foolish\", was released in April 2005 and brought Rae to the attention of the major record label bosses.

       " 'Corneille (Cornelius Nyungura) is a rhythm and blues French singer. He was born on March 24, 1977, in Freiburg, Germany, to his parents who were completing their University studies there. He lived there for 6 years, until he was brought to live in his country of origin, Rwanda. He lived in a village for a short time, before moving to Rwanda\\'s capitol, Kigali.\\n\\nCorneille developed an interest in music early on, and it was an interest his father supported and encouraged. His influences included Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Marvin Gaye, Sam Cooke, Nat King Cole as well as Prince and other artists.\\n\\nAt 16 years old Corneille made his first recording, and was selected as a finalist in a music contest sponsored by the state run television station in Kigali. Corneille\\'s childhood could be characterized as normal for a somewhat privileged youth brought up in a family with caring, highly educated parents.\\n\\nDaily life in Kigali changed dramatically in 1994, when former President Habyarimana was assassinated, and the largest, most horrific genocide in modern history claimed over 800,000 victims.\\n\\nCorneille managed to escape first to Kinshasa, and then to Germany, where he was adopted by friends of his parents. He stayed in Germany for three years completing his baccalaureate studies, before arriving ultimately in Montréal. Corneille enrolled in University when he landed in Montréal, but his focus was immediately diverted to music.\\n\\nIn Montréal at 20 years old, Corneille formed a band called O.N.E., meaning Original New Element. O.N.E. achieved modest success, thanks in part to a Ms. Jodi Richards, who supported and advised the band. When O.N.E. disbanded in 2001, Corneille again turned to Ms. Richards for advice. Ms. Richards imparted the belief that you are only an artist when you know what your art means, which became a guiding principal for Corneille.\\n\\nIn 2002 Corneille released his first studio album, \\'Parce Qu\\'on Vient de Loin.\\' Initially, \\'Parce Qu\\'on Vient de Loin\\' went for the most part unnoticed in Canada, but due in large part to promotional efforts made by Wagram, Corneille\\'s label in France, Corneille\\'s first album\\'s sales skyrocketed. \\'Ensemble\\' and \\'Sans Rancunes,\\' were the first two hit singles from the album. Sales of \\'Parce Qu\\'on Vient de Loin\\' gathered powerful momentum, but the album was still virtually unnoticed in Canada. DKD\\'s (now DEJA Musique CEO) Janie Duquette completely re-released the album, with \\'Rêves de Star\\' as the first single. By 2004 sales of \\'Parce Qu\\'on Vient de Loin\\' on both sides of the Atlantic were booming. With sales reaching Platinum status in Canada, Corneille received his first Felix Award for Best Male Artist selected by the public at the \\'Gala de la Disque\\' in Montréal. Meanwhile in France sales of the album reached over 500,000 copies.\\n\\nIn 2005 Corneille\\'s ascent continued, as he recorded a song with Senegalese superstar Youssou N\\'Dour, in support of Unicef and the fight against AIDS. Corneille is a Red Cross Canada spokeperson, has been made a Unicef Goodwill Ambassador, and continues to be active in those and other humanitarian roles.\\n\\nIn 2005 Corneille\\'s second studio album, \\'Les Marchands de Rêves\\' was released to rave critical reviews.\\n\\n\\nIn 2007, Corneille earned and signed contracts with Sony Music Japan, and with UniversalMotown for the World ex-Japan (SMJI), France (Wagram) & Canada (DEJA). With these partners, as well as Universal Music Group partners in the UK and elsewhere, and with help from all of you at corneille.ca, Corneille\\'s fanbase is becoming truly global.\\n\\nOn November 20, 2007, Corneille was given the award for best International Singer-songwriter by SOCAN. Look for \\'The Birth of Cornelius\\' US\\' release on UniversalMOTOWN in Spring 2008.

       " 'With her light, airy vocals, Bronx-born Cory Daye helped to transform Dr. Buzzard\\'s Original Savannah Band into one of the most exciting bands of the late-\\'70s disco era. Creating some of the earliest disco recordings, Daye and Dr. Buzzard\\'s Original Savannah Band skillfully mixed big band, swing, jump blues, Broadway tunes, and Caribbean influences into their infectious dance music.\\n\\nLeaving the Savannah band to pursue a solo career, Daye found immediate success, she enlisted the songwriting and production of Sandy Linzer to replicate her former band\\'s sound on her solo debut, Cory and Me. Linzer was a particularly appropriate match for Daye, since he had already worked with Odyssey on their r. Buzzard-inspired disco classic \"Native New Yorker.\" Perhaps hoping for similar Top 40 success, Daye seems more commercially motivated on Cory and Me, but that accessibility works wonders on the two opening cuts, \"Green Light\" and \"Pow Wow.\" On both songs, Daye uses her playfully expressive voice to transform the potentially hokey lyrics into irresistible verses. . Daye\\'s charm and enthusiasm are contagious throughout, but the rest of the songs fail to match her energy level, and the scattered Dr. Buzzard touches often seem diluted by the album\\'s mainstream ambitions. Nevertheless, most Dr. Buzzard followers will probably enjoy the familiarity of Cory and Me, and the album may also appeal to fans of late-\\'70s disco divas who are unfamiliar with Daye\\'s considerable talents.\\n\\nSet back by the collapse of disco, Daye joined Kid Creole & the Coconuts in the early \\'80s, singing on their 1982 album, Tropical Gangsters, and appearing as a guest vocalist on their 1995 album, To Travel Sideways. Resuming her solo career, Daye recorded a pair of 12\" singles, \"City Nights\" b/w \"Manhattan Cafes\" in 1986 and \"Middle of the Night in 1987. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cory+Daye\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Willie \"The Lion\" Smith, James P. Johnson, and Fats Waller were among his influences.\\n\\nAs a bandleader, he created an organization (built upon the remains of Bennie Moten\\'s Kansas City Orchestra) that was a favorite both of dancers and of vocalists such as Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, and, of course, Billie Holiday. Equally important, it kept many musicians employed through lean years. Many jazz musicians of note built their chops and earned their bread and butter in Basie\\'s organization.\\n\\nIn addition to Basie, the swinging \"All American  Rhythm Section\" of his orchestra included greats such as Walter Page (bass), Jo Jones (drums), and Freddie Green (guitar). It was the greatest, most swinging rhythm sections in the history of jazz. Chief among its vocalists were, first, Jimmy Rushing and, later, Joe Williams. Over the years it boasted sidemen and soloists like Herschel Evans (tenor sax), Lester Young (tenor sax), Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis (tenor sax), Buddy Tate (tenor sax), Illinois Jacquet (tenor sax), Earle Warren (alto sax), Jack Washington (alto & baritone sax), Harry \"Sweets\" Edison (trumpet), Buck Clayton (trumpet), Thad Jones (trumpet), Snooky Young (trumpet), Benny Morton (trombone), Benny Powell (trombone), and Dicky Wells (trombone).\\n\\nBasie also collaborated with artists such as Zoot Sims and Oscar Peterson, and recorded with ensembles large and small, including the Count Basie Trio, the Count Basie Sextet, and the Kansas City Seven.

At the age of 17, he enlisted in the United States Navy for three years and was stationed in Japan. After his enlistment, he attended Los Angeles City College for a year. In the early 1960s, he began busking on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, California. His father, Worden McDonald, from Oklahoma, was of Scottish Presbyterian heritage (the son of a minister); he worked for a telephone company. His mother, Florence Plotnick, was the daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants and served for many years on the Berkeley City Council. In their youth, both were Communist Party members before renouncing the cause, and named their son after Joseph Stalin. \\n\\nMcDonald has recorded 33 albums and has written hundreds of songs over a career spanning 40 years. In 1965, he and Barry Melton co-founded Country Joe & the Fish which became a pioneer psychedelic rock band with their eclectic performances at the Avalon Ballroom, the Fillmore, the Monterey Pop Festival, and both the original and 1979 reunion Woodstock Festivals. \\n\\nIn the fall of 2005, political commentator Bill O\\'Reilly compared McDonald to Cuban President Fidel Castro, remarking on McDonald\\'s involvement in Cindy Sheehan\\'s protests against the Iraq War. \\n\\nIn 2015, McDonald (with assistance from Alec Palao), formed The Electric Music Band; the intention of the group was to perform the early psychedelic material of the early career of Country Joe And The Fish.

He was a member of the Grand Ole Opry.\\n\\nCopas was born in 1913 in Blue Creek, Ohio, in Adams County. He began performing locally at age 14, and appeared on WLW-AM and WKRC-AM in Cincinnati during the 1930s. In 1940 he moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, where he performed on WNOX-AM with his band, the Gold Star Rangers.\\nIn 1943, Copas achieved national fame when he replaced Eddy Arnold as a vocalist in the Pee Wee King band and began performing on the Grand Ole Opry. His first solo single, \"Filipino Baby\", released by King Records in 1946, hit No. 4 on the Billboard country chart and sparked the most successful period of his career.\\nWhile continuing to appear on the Opry, Copas recorded several other hits during the late 1940s and early 1950s, including \"Signed Sealed and Delivered\", \"The Tennessee Waltz\", \"Tennessee Moon\", \"Breeze\", \"I\\'m Waltzing with Tears in My Eyes\", \"Candy Kisses\", \"Hangman\\'s Boogie\", and \"The Strange Little Girl\".

       " 'Cozy Cole (October 17, 1909 – January 9, 1981) was an American jazz drummer who scored a #1 Cashbox magazine hit with the record \"Topsy Part 2\" (also known as \"Topsy II\", \"Topsy 2\", and so on). That song peaked at number three on Billboard Hot 100 and at number one on the R&B chart. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. The track, which also peaked at #29 in the U.K. Singles Chart in 1958, contained a lengthy drum solo and was one of the few drum solo recordings that ever made the Billboard Hot 100. The single was issued on the tiny Brooklyn-based Love Records label. According to his bio from Billboard.com, \"Cozy Cole\\'s drumming was an essential ingredient in much of the jazz recorded during the 1930s and \\'40s\".\\n\\nWilliam Randolph Cole was born in 1909 in East Orange, New Jersey. His first music job was with Wilbur Sweatman in 1928. In 1930 he played for Jelly Roll Morton\\'s Red Hot Peppers, recording an early drum solo on \"Load of Cole\". He spent 1931–33 with Blanche Calloway, 1933-34 with Benny Carter, 1935-36 with Willie Bryant, 1936-38 with Stuff Smith\\'s small combo, and 1938-42 with Cab Calloway. In 1942, he was hired by CBS Radio music director Raymond Scott as part of network radio\\'s first mixed-race orchestra. After that, he played with Louis Armstrong\\'s All Stars.\\n\\nCole appeared in music-related films, including a brief cameo in Don\\'t Knock the Rock. Throughout the 1960s and \\'70s Cole continued to perform in a variety of settings. Cole and Gene Krupa often played duets at the Metropole in New York City during the 1950s and 1960s.\\n\\nHe died of cancer in 1981, in Columbus, Ohio. Cole is cited as an influence by many contemporary rock drummers, including Cozy Powell, who took his nickname \"Cozy\" from Cole. His jazz work has been cited positively by numerous music critics.\\n\\nКози Коул (англ. Cozy Cole; настоящее имя Вильям Рэндольф Коул, англ. William Randolph Cole; 17 октября 1909, Ист Орэндж, Нью-Джерси, США — 31 января 1981, Колумбус, Огайо) — американский джазовый барабанщик. Один из знаменитых барабанщиков эпохи свинга.\\n\\nКоул оказал влияние на многих барабанщиков, в том числе Кози Пауэлла, который взял себе сценическое имя Кози именно в честь Кози Коула.\\n\\nРодился в 1909 году в Ист-Оранже, штат Нью-Джерси. Самостоятельно освоил ударные инструменты, приехал в Нью-Йорк, работал парикмахером в пароходстве и брал частные уроки у Чарли Брукса — барабанщика Линкольн-театра.\\n\\nУчась в школе, Уильям Коул принимал участие в футбольном матче. Передавая ему пас, партнёр по команде крикнул: «Эй, Коулзи, принимай!» Так у будущего барабанщика появилось прозвище, которое впоследствии уменьшилось до «Кози».\\n\\nНачало его карьеры барабанщика относится к 1928 году когда он начинает сотрудничать с Вилбером Свитэном. В 1930 году он играл в Jelly Roll Morton\\'s Red Hot Peppers, записав соло на ударных в песне «Load of Cole». В 1931-33 годах он играл с Blanche Calloway. Известность ему принесла игра в оркестрах Бенни Картера (1933-34), Уилли Брайанта (1935-36), Стаффа Смита (1936-38), Кэба Кэллауэя (1938-42). С последним составом записал блестящие композиции «Crescendo In Drums», «Paradiddle». В 1942 он был приглашён Рэймондом Скоттом, музыкальным директором радио CBS, в оркестр.\\n\\nЕго сингл 1938 года «Topsy Part 2», значительную часть которого составляет соло на ударных, достиг 3-й позиции в Billboard Hot 100 и первого номера в R&B-чарте.\\n\\nСтремясь добиться совершенства, в 1942-45 учился в Джульярдской школе. В 1949-53 играл в звёздном составе Луи Армстронга — «Louis Armstrong’s All Stars», параллельно выступая в бродвейских театрах и записываясь со многими музыкантами свинга.\\n\\nВ 1952 году вместе с Джином Крупой организовал в Нью-Йорке школу барабанщиков, которая просуществовала до 1973 года.\\n\\nКози Коул иногда снимался в эпизодических ролях в фильмах на музыкальную тематику, например Don\\'t Knock the Rock. В 1960-х и 1970-х годах продолжал играть с различными исполнителями.\\n\\nСкончался 31 января 1981 года от рака в Колумбусе, штат Огайо. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cozy+Cole\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Colin Flooks (December 29, 1947 - April 5, 1998), better known as Cozy Powell, was an English rock drummer.\\n\\nBorn in Cirencester, Powell started his musical career with The Sorcerers in 1965. In 1971 he joined the Jeff Beck group for two albums, before going solo then forming Bedlam. His solo single Dance With The Devil reached third place in the UK charts in 1973. Two other top 20 singles followed, as Cozy Powell\\'s Hammer. The following year, Cozy made headlines when he appeared on the BBC children\\'s programme Record Breakers where he set a world record for being the world\\'s fastest drummer live on television.\\n\\nIn 1976 he joined Ritchie Blackmore\\'s Rainbow, the band for which he is probably best remembered.\\n\\nIn 1980, when Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham died, Cozy was considered by the band as a possible replacement for Bonham. The band decided against it and disbanded.\\n\\nOn August 16, 1980, Rainbow headlined the first ever Monsters of Rock show at Castle Donington, England. Following the success of the event (which in turn followed the success of Rainbow\\'s 1979 Down to Earth LP from which singles Since You Been Gone and All Night Long are taken), Powell left Rainbow along with vocalist Graham Bonnet to start work on Bonnet\\'s new project called Graham Bonnet & the Hooligans, their most notable single being Night Games (1981). Powell then performed with a number of major bands - Michael Schenker Group from 1981 to 1982, Whitesnake from 1982 to 1984, then with Keith Emerson, Greg Lake in 1986 and Gary Moore in 1989, then Black Sabbath intermittently from 1989 to 1991, and again from 1993 - 1995.\\n\\nCozy along with Neil Murray (fellow ex-member of Cozy Powell\\'s Hammer, Whitesnake, Gary Moore and Black Sabbath) were members of the Brian May Band, playing on the Back To The Light and Another World albums. They were due to start touring with the band in the Autumn of 1998. The duo also served a spell with returning blues legend Peter Green in the mid nineties.\\n\\nCozy Powell died on April 5, 1998 following a car crash, driving his Saab 9000 in bad weather on the M4 motorway near Bristol. He had returned to the studio shortly before his death to record with ex Fleetwood Mac guitarist Peter Green, as part of Peter\\'s Splinter Group. By that time, he had been the drummer on at least 66 albums with minor contributions on many other recordings. It was generally felt that Powell\\'s death was a great loss to the world of popular music. Countless rock-based drummers have cited Cozy Powell as an influence.\\n\\nFrom the official Cozy Powell website:\\n\\n\"Cozy Powell is one of the most prolific drummers in the business. His CV runs like a Who\\'s Who of rock, with stints as a fully paid up member of Black Sabbath, Rainbow, Whitesnake, M.S.G. and the ELP spin-off Emerson, Lake, & Powell. Then there are those legendary guest appearances - with everyone from Donovan to Roger Daltrey, Jack Bruce to Jeff Beck and Gary Moore to Brian May.\\n\\nHis career not only spans three decades, it\\'s also one of the most diverse in rock. In the 1960\\'s, Cozy was a member of the Ace Kefford Stand; in the 70\\'s he was a session drummer for Mickie Most\\'s RAK label, which made Cozy a household name with the Dance With the Devil single; and in 1991, he turned up on Comic Relief\\'s No 1 single, \"The Stonk\", with comedians Hale & Pace!\\n\\nSince then Cozy joined Brian May on a Jimi Hendrix tribute album, and supported the legendary Peter Green on his comeback. Most recently, sessions with Glenn Tipton (Judas Priest), Brian May (new album) and Yngwie Malmsteen, the last two with tours, have seen Cozy Powell back to his busiest and perhaps, his best.\\n\\n----\\n\\nCozy wrote this text himself when the site first went online and had intended to continue this with further info, but alas, he never did.

       " 'Curtis Lee (28 October 1939 - 8 January 2015) born in Yuma, Arizona, USA an American Doo-wop and Pop singer of the early 1960s, and was the beneficiary of two great 1961 productions by Phil Spector.\\n\\nThese were \"Pretty Little Angel Eyes\" (U.S. Top 10) and \"Under The Moon Of Love\" (U.S. Top 50). In the UK, \"Pretty Little Angel Eyes\" was a minor hit record, going no higher than 47 in 1961.\\n\\nLee began his recording career in 1959, and the following year was signed by Dunes Records. Handsome and photogenic, Lee had a vocal approach close to the teen idols of the period. Spector\\'s genius with the productions, besides his deft handling of the instrumental support, was to provide fills with strong doo-wop riffing from an R&B vocal group, The Halos, to produce two classic rock \\'n\\' roll tunes.\\n\\nWithout Spector\\'s guiding hand however, the hits simply dried up around 1968. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Curtis+Lee\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Curtis Mayfield (June 3, 1942 – December 26, 1999) was an American soul, funk and rhythm and blues, singer-songwriter and guitarist from Chicago, Illinois.\\n\\nMayfield is probably best known for his anthemic music with The Impressions and for the soundtrack to the blaxploitation film Superfly.\\n\\nPerhaps because he didn\\'t cross over to the pop audience as heavily as Motown\\'s stars, it may be that the scope of Curtis Mayfield\\'s talents and contributions have yet to be fully recognized. Judged merely by his records alone, the man\\'s legacy is enormous. As the leader of the Impressions, he recorded some of the finest soul vocal group music of the 1960s. As a solo artist in the 1970s, he helped pioneer funk and helped introduce hard-hitting urban commentary into soul music. \"Gypsy Woman,\" \"It\\'s All Right,\" \"People Get Ready,\" \"Freddie\\'s Dead,\" and \"Superfly\" are merely the most famous of his many hit records.\\n\\nBut Curtis Mayfield wasn\\'t just a singer. Born in in Chicago, IL, he wrote most of his material at a time when that was not the norm for soul performers. He was among the first -- if not the very first -- to speak openly about African-American pride and community struggle in his compositions. As a songwriter and a producer, he was a key architect of Chicago Soul, penning material and working on sessions by notable Windy City soulsters like Gene Chandler, Jerry Butler, Major Lance, and Billy Butler. In this sense, he can be compared to Smokey Robinson, who also managed to find time to write and produce many classics for other soul stars. Mayfield was also an excellent guitarist, and his rolling, Latin-influenced lines were highlights of the Impressions\\' recordings in the \\'60s. During the next decade, he would toughen up his guitar work and production, incorporating some of the best features of psychedelic rock and funk.\\n\\nMayfield began his career as an associate of Jerry Butler, with whom he formed the Impressions in the late \\'50s. After the Impressions had a big hit in 1958 with \"For Your Precious Love,\" Butler, who had sung lead on the record, split to start a solo career. Mayfield, while keeping the Impressions together, continued to write for and tour with Butler before the Impressions got their first Top 20 hit in 1961, \"Gypsy Woman.\"\\n\\nMayfield was heavily steeped in gospel music before he entered the pop arena, and gospel, as well as doo wop, influences would figure prominently in most of his \\'60s work. Mayfield wasn\\'t a staunch traditionalist, however. He and the Impressions may have often worked the call-and-response gospel style, but his songs (romantic and otherwise) were often veiled or unveiled messages of black pride, reflecting the increased confidence and self-determination of the African-American community. Musically he was an innovator as well, using arrangements that employed the punchy, blaring horns and Latin-influenced rhythms that came to be trademark flourishes of Chicago soul. As the staff producer for the OKeh label, Mayfield was also instrumental in lending his talents to the work of other Chi-town soul singers who went on to national success. With Mayfield singing lead and playing guitar, the Impressions had 14 Top 40 hits in the 1960s (five made the Top 20 in 1964 alone), and released some above-average albums during that period as well.\\n\\nGiven Mayfield\\'s prodigious talents, it was perhaps inevitable that he would eventually leave the Impressions to begin a solo career, as he did in 1970. His first few singles boasted a harder, more funk-driven sound; singles like \"(Don\\'t Worry) If There\\'s a Hell Below, We\\'re All Gonna Go\" found him confronting ghetto life with a realism that had rarely been heard on record. He really didn\\'t hit his artistic or commercial stride as a solo artist, though, until Superfly, his soundtrack to a 1972 blaxploitation film. Drug deals, ghetto shootings, the death of young black men before their time: all were described in penetrating detail. Yet Mayfield\\'s irrepressible falsetto vocals, uplifting melodies, and fabulous funk pop arrangements gave the oft-moralizing material a graceful strength that few others could have achieved. For all the glory of his past work, Superfly stands as his crowning achievement, not to mention a much-needed counterpoint to the sensationalistic portrayals of the film itself.\\n\\nAt this point Mayfield, along with Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, was the foremost exponent of a new level of compelling auteurism in soul. His failure to maintain the standards of Superfly qualifies as one of the great disappointments in the history of black popular music. Perhaps he\\'d simply reached his peak after a long climb, but the rest of his \\'70s work didn\\'t match the musical brilliance and lyrical subtleties of Superfly, although he had a few large R&B hits in a much more conventional vein, such as \"Kung Fu,\" \"So in Love,\" and \"Only You Babe.\"\\n\\nMayfield had a couple of hits in the early \\'80s, but the decade generally found his commercial fortunes in a steady downward spiral, despite some intermittent albums.\\nOn August 14, 1990, he became paralyzed from the neck down when a lighting rig fell on top of him at a concert in Brooklyn, NY. In 1993, three years after the accident which caused Mayfield\\'s paralysis, Shanachie records released the album People Get Ready: A Tribute to Curtis Mayfield featuring a.o. Jerry Butler, Don Covay and Steve Cropper. \\n\\nMayfield received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995.\\n\\nCurtis Mayfield died December 26, 1999 at the North Fulton Regional Hospital in Roswell, Georgia.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Curtis+Mayfield\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Early on in his dee jaying career he was influenced by Josey Wales. He joined Killamanjaro where he worked alongside Early B, Super Cat, Puddy Roots, and Little Twitch.

       " 'Cyndi Lauper (born Cynthia Ann Stephanie Lauper on June 22, 1953 in Brooklyn, New York, United States), is a Grammy Award-winning singer (who possesses a four-octave vocal range) and Emmy Award-winning film, television and theatre actress. She was lead singer of the rockabilly band Blue Angel before her rise to fame as a solo singer. Her melodic voice and wild costumes have come to epitomize the 1980s and New Wave — the decade and genre in which she first came to fame.\\n\\nBorn in Queens, New York to Swiss German-American Fred Lauper and Sicilian Italian-American Catrine Dominique, she began her career in a cover band, but soon began performing her own songs (though she almost quit singing altogether due to strained vocal chords in 1977). By 1980 she\\'d released a rockabilly album on Polydor with the band Blue Angel. Despite much critical acclaim, the album \"went lead,\" as Lauper says, and the band split as Lauper filed for bankruptcy.\\n\\nIn 1983 she started dating her manager David Wolff with whom she released She\\'s So Unusual, a worldwide hit album which made Lauper a household name. A mixture of teen-friendly pop-rock and edgier, almost punky sounds, the album\\'s biggest hit, Girls Just Want to Have Fun, quickly established itself as a female anthem. Lauper won a Grammy Award for Best New Artist at the Grammy Awards of 1984 for her work on the album. Lauper was the first female artist to have four consecutive Hot 100 Top 5 hits from one album.\\n\\nSubsequent albums (such as True Colors, A Night to Remember, Hat Full of Stars) did not sell as well, but Lauper remains active to the present day and still retains a very strong fan base.\\n\\nLauper\\'s latest album Memphis Blues was released in June 2011, premiering at #1 on the Billboard Blues Album Chart where it remained for 14 consecutive weeks.  The album also reached #26 on the Billboard Top 200, and was later named the Billboard Blues Album of the year, also earning Lauper a Grammy nomination. This brought her total Grammy nominations to 13 with one win.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cyndi+Lauper\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Cyndi Thomson is an American singer who had two hit singles before giving up the music industry. She was born on October 19, 1976 and grew up in Tifton, GA. She eventually moved to Nashville to make it as a singer. In July 2001 her first CD titled My World was released and her first single \"What I Really Meant To Say\" was a hit. Her second single \"I Always Liked That Best\" was also well received. The album has since gone gold. In a surprising move for a new artist, on October 2002 Thomson announced that she was quitting the entertainment industry. Cyndi Thomson has claimed to have had personal obligations for quitting, as well as the desire to start and have a family. In 2006 it was revealed on the website CMT that the singer will be returning to music.\\n\\nBiography\\n\\n[edit] Early life\\nCyndi Thomson was born and raised in Tifton, Georgia, the youngest of four daughters for Pat and Russ Thomson. As a child, she was exposed to many different types of music. Her parents listened to the oldies while her sisters listened to music by Manhattan Transfer and Janet Jackson among others.[2] As Thomson got older, she began singing in church like her sisters did. At the age of twelve, she knew that she wanted to be a singer and at thirteen, after listening to Trisha Yearwood\\'s \"She\\'s in Love with the Boy\", she knew that she wanted to be a country singer.[3]\\n\\nAfter graduating high school and winning a Georgia Music Hall of Fame scholarship,[4] Thomson attended Kennesaw State University in Atlanta.[5] Feeling that her dream of being a country singer was not going to be realized staying in Atlanta, she moved to Nashville, Tennessee. There, she attended Belmont University and enrolled in its music business program,[3] but dropped out after a year and a half realizing that school was not necessary for her to do what she wanted to do.[2] Thomson did various jobs while pursuing the recording career that she wanted, one of which was a modelling job at a party for Deana Carter\\'s album Did I Shave My Legs for This? going platinum.[3] One of the other models there later introduced Thomson to songwriter Tommy Lee James,[6] who wrote for Brooks & Dunn and Martina McBride.\\n\\n\\n[edit] Music career\\nEven though Thomson had never written a song before, James agreed to work with her and within a year of writing their first song, Thomson signed with Sony-ATV Music Publishing as a songwriter.[2][3] In 2000, James introduced Thomson to Capitol Records Nashville which signed her to a record deal immediately after hearing her sing three songs.[6] Thomson co-wrote eight of the eleven songs on her debut album My World, released on July 31, 2001. The album was co-produced by James and producer Paul Worley and became the best-selling debut album by a female country singer since LeAnn Rimes\\' album Blue was released in 1996.[7] The album was certified gold, for selling more than 500,000 copies, by the Recording Industry Association of America ten months after the album\\'s release.[8][9]\\n\\nThe debut single from My World, \"What I Really Meant to Say\", became an instant hit. The single, written after a re-encounter with an old boyfriend,[3] spent eight consecutive weeks at the top of the country singles sales chart and three consecutive weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts.[8] The single also became the only debut single by a female country singer to spend more than one week at the top of the Radio & Records country chart.[7] Thomson\\'s next two singles, \"I Always Liked That Best\" and \"I\\'m Gone\", failed to reach the top 20, with the former peaking at #21 and the latter peaking at #31 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart.\\n\\nIn late 2002, Thomson, in a letter written to her record label, fans and friends, announced that she was walking away from her recording career.[10] Thomson, who married musician and producer Daniel Goodman earlier that year, stated that being a recording artist was an \"overwhelming life changing experience\" and that she \"cannot commit to [the] obligations\" of making a new album.[10][1] She did, however, contribute to the 2004 album Amazing Grace 3: A Country Salute to Gospel, on which she sang \"\\'Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus\".[11] She also sang \"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\" for the album Christmas Angels released by Capitol Nashville in 2005.[12][13] \"Life Ain\\'t Always Beautiful\", co-written by Thomson and credited to her as Cyndi Goodman, became a top five hit for Gary Allan in 2006. That year, she also returned to Capitol Nashville after leaving the label for four years and started recording for her second album with James.[14]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Discography\\n\\n[edit] Albums\\nYear Title US Country US 200 RIAA \\n2001 My World 7 81 Gold \\n\\n\\n[edit] Singles\\nYear Song US Country US Hot 100 Album \\n2001 \"What I Really Meant to Say\" 1 26 My World \\n\"I Always Liked That Best\" 21 119 \\n2002 \"I\\'m Gone\" 31  \\n\\n\\n[edit] References\\n^ a b Loftus, Johnny.

       " 'D.C. LaRue (born David Charles L\\'Heureux on April 26, 1948 in Meriden, Connecticut, U.S.A.) is a disco music artist. His music was successful in clubs and on dance music charts worldwide during the 1970s and early 1980s.\\nLaRue\\'s first recording was the 1974 Kirshner Records single \"Honey Bear (The Good Time\\'s Right Here).\" A second one-off single, 1975\\'s \"Move In Closer,\" was on the Claridge Records imprint. Neither single charted. However the following year his luck changed with the 1976 album Ca-the-drals. The Pyramid Records album rose to #-123 on \"Billboard\\'s Hot 200\" The double A-side 12\" single of \"Ca-the-drals\" (backed with fellow artist/drummer Pat Lundy\\'s \"Day By Day/My Sweet Lord\") was one of the earliest commercially available 12\" singles. \"Ca-the-drals/Deep Dark Delicious Night\" would hit #-1 on \"Billboard\\'s Dance Music/Club Play Singles\" chart. \"Ca-the-drals\" would also hit #-2 on \"Billboard\\'s Disco Singles\" chart and #-94 on \"Billboard\\'s Hot 100\" chart.\\n\\nIn less than a year he began work on his second album, The Tea Dance. The 1977 concept album capturing the essence and feel of a Broadway show featured such notable background singers as Lani Groves and Sharon Redd. It also included a duet with 1960s rock/pop icon Lou Christie on \"Don\\'t Keep It In The Shadows.\" The tracks: \"Face Of Love,\" \"Overture,\" \"O Ba Ba (No Reino Da Mae Do Ouro),\" \"Indiscreet\" and \"Don\\'t Keep It In The Shadows\" would all chart at #-2 on \"Billboard\\'s Dance Music Club Play Singles\" chart. \"Indiscreet\" would go one to become one of the more important and influential hip hop break tracks of the old skool hip hop eras.\\n\\nDespite the brisk sales of both of LaRue\\'s albums Pyramid Records folded operations in the USA in 1978. With the success of those albums he was easily licensed to Casablanca Records & Filmworks in 1978. His first release on his new label was \"Do You Want The Real Thing?\" The single was included on the platinum selling soundtrack album for the movie Thank God It\\'s Friday. That same year saw LaRue release his third album Confessions. Once again he scored a hit with \"Let Them Dance\" which hit #-12 on \"Billboard\\'s Dance Music/Club Play Singles\" chart.  Also in 1978 LaRue had a cameo in the ill-fated movie Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band.\\n\\nIn 1979 he released his fourth album Forces Of The Night. The singles \"On With The Dance\" (a duet with Michelle Aller) and \"Hot Jungle Drums And Voodoo Rhythm\" were released and the album charted at #-72 on \"Billboard\\'s Dance Music/Club Play Singles\" chart. The album also featured a duet with Rita Moreno on \"Have A Good Time.\" \"Hot Jungle Drums And Voodoo Rhythm\" was also included on the platinum selling compilation \"A Night At Studio 54.\"\\n\\nIn 1980 he released his fifth and final album Star Baby. The album retained the spark and ingenuity that had been prevalent in his earlier releases but with the end of the disco era it failed to chart. The album featured another duet with Lou Christie \"Into The Ozone\" and the 12\" single of \"So Much For L.A.\"/\"Boys Can\\'t Fake It.\"\\n\\nIn 2006 his \"Ca-the-drals\" was sampled in England on the track \"3 AM\" by Moto Blanco (Bobby Blanco & Miki Moto.) The highly successful track would introduce LaRue and his music to a whole new generation. That same year LaRue released Wicked Youth (Selected Performances 1976-1984) from his own website. Besides rare edits of his previous hits the disc also included the previously mentioned \"3 AM,\" \"Good Morning, My Love\" (with The Boys Choir Of Harlem), \"Love Can Make You Strong\" (another duet with Lou Christie previously unreleased) and \"Edge Of The Night\" (with Adam Goldstone.)\\n\\nIn 2010, LaRue recorded the new track \"Crash And Burn\" for the Ian Levine produced compilation album Northern Soul: 2010. In February 2012, LaRue returned with \"More Things Change.\" A Nu Disco genre track he did with artist/producer Jimmy Michaels. As of 2012 LaRue has been the host of his own radio show \"Disco Juice\" on Newtown Radio. Tributes, themed shows as well as interviews of famed disco artists are his format on the Saturday night show.\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/D.C.+LaRue\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Kenneth Ray Rogers (August 21, 1938 – March 20, 2020) was a prolific American country music singer, songwriter, actor, record producer, businessman, and entrepreneur. Kenny Rogers graduated from Jefferson Davis High School in Houston. He was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2013. Though he was most successful with country audiences, Rogers charted more than 120 hit singles across various music genres, topped the country and pop album charts for more than 200 individual weeks in the United States alone, and sold over 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time.\\n\\nAlthough he has been very successful, charting more than 60 top 40 hit singles across various music genres and topping the country and pop album charts for more than 100 individual weeks in the United States alone, many still consider him a vastly underrated artist. To his fans, he is extraordinarily popular; women in concert audiences bring him roses in unrelenting waves throughout a performance. He appeals to all age groups and still sells millions of albums.\\n\\nBoth his albums \"The Gambler\" and \"Kenny\" are featured in the About.com poll of \"The 200 Most Influential Country Albums Ever\". He has also been voted the \"Favorite Singer of All-Time\", in a 1986 joint poll by readers of both USA Today and People.\\n\\nHe has received hundreds of awards for both his music and charity work. These include AMA\\'s Grammy\\'s, ACM\\'s and CMA\\'s, as well as a lifetime achievement award for a career spanning six decades in 2003\\n\\nMost recently, Rogers hit with his new album release, \"Water & Bridges\", an across the board hit, that peaked at #5 in the Billboard Country Albums sales charts, also charting high in the Billboard 200. The first single from the album, \"I Can\\'t Unlove You,\" is also a hit. He is currently planning a tour of the United Kingdom, in a 2006 BBC Radio 2 interview he told DJ Steve Wright, his favorite hit of his was The Gambler.\\n\\nBiography - Brief Overview:\\nHis career began in the mid-1950s, when he recorded with a doo-wop group called The Scholars. Their break up was followed by a minor solo hit called \"That Crazy Feeling\" (1958). After sales slowed down, Kenneth Rogers (as he was billed then) joined a Jazz group called The Bobby Doyle Trio. Disbanded in 1965, a 1966 jazzy rock single for Mercury called \"Here\\'s That Rainy Day\" failed. In 1966 he joined the New Christy Minstrels. He left with fellow members Mike Settle, Terry Williams and Thelma Camacho. They formed The First Edition in 1967 (later renamed \"Kenny Rogers and The First Edition\"). They chalked up a string of hits on both the pop and country charts, including \"Ruby, Don\\'t Take Your Love To Town\", \"Reuben James\" and \"Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In).\" In his First Edition days Rogers had long brown hair, an earring, and pink sunglasses. Known affectionately in retrospect as \"Hippie Kenny\", Rogers had a much smoother vocal style at the time. A thin man when the group first started, from about 1971 on he had begun to gain weight and slightly gray. The group split, and Rogers launched his solo career in 1976 and he developed a more middle of the road gravel voiced style that sold to both pop and country audiences; to date, he has charted more than 60 top 40 hit singles (including upwards of 25 #1\\'s) and no fewer than 50 of his albums have charted. His music has also been featured in top selling movie soundtracks, such as Convoy and Urban Cowboy.\\n\\nAlthough in the 1990s with the emergence of Garth Brooks, it was noted that this new talent was selling records like no one else had ever in country music, Rogers was nonetheless a dominant force in mainstream music and at his height, was charting singles (and albums) which were racing up the top 40 on the pop charts around the world, songs like \"Lucille\", \"Coward Of The County\", \"The Gambler\" and \"Lady\" became favorites among many music lovers and have remained such, making Rogers one of the most popular entertainers on the touring circuit.\\n\\nThe Early Days:\\nAfter leaving The First Edition in 1976, after almost a decade with the group, Rogers signed a solo deal with United Artists. Although producer Larry Butler had no doubts about Kenny\\'s talent and that he wanted to sign him, he was advised by several colleges not to sign Rogers, as he was seen as a has-been. Nevertheless, Butler and Rogers began a partnership that would run for four consecutive years.\\n\\nRogers first outing for his new label was \"Love Lifted Me\". The album charted and two singles \"Love Lifted Me\" and \"While The Feelings Good\" were minor hits. Later in the year Rogers issued his second album, the self-titled \"Kenny Rogers\", which first single \"Laura (What\\'s He Got That I Ain\\'t Got)\", was another solo hit. However, it took \"Lucille\" in 1977 to blow Rogers post-First Edition career wide open, reaching Number One in no less than 12 countries, selling over five million copies world-wide and pushing the \"Kenny Rogers\" album to #1 in the Billboard Country Album Chart. More success was to follow, including the multi-million selling album \"The Gambler\" and another international Number 1 single \"Coward Of The County\", taken from the equally successful album, \"Kenny\". In 1980, The Rogers/Butler partnership came to an end, but Butler continued to work with Kenny on later releases such as \"I Prefer The Moonlight\" in 1987 and \"If Only My Heart Had A Voice\" in 1993.\\n\\nOutside Music:\\nLike many other successful singers, such as Elvis Presley, he also had success as an actor. His 1982 movie \"Six Pack\" (in which he played a race-car driver) took more than $20 million at the US box office, while made-for-TV movies such as \"The Gambler,\" \"Christmas in America\" and \"Coward of the County\" (based on hit songs of his) topped ratings lists. As an entrepreneur, he collaborated with former Kentucky Fried Chicken CEO John Y. Brown, Jr. in 1991 to start up the restaurant chain, Kenny Rogers Roasters. The chicken and ribs chain, which is similar to Boston Market, was famously featured in an episode of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld, when Kramer tried to have a location of the restaurant put out of business due to its annoying red neon light. On \"Late Night with Conan O’Brien\" he could not pick his chicken out in a taste test claiming he preferred \"greasy burgers\". * Kenny Rogers has been parodied in several MADtv segments by comedian Will Sasso. He is usually portrayed (in an exaggerated manner) as a drunk, egotistical idiot. Two sketches feature Rogers in a parody of MTV\\'s Jackass TV series; other skits show him in parodies of Punk\\'d and Fear Factor. In those segments, Sasso uses comically excessive amounts of foul language, slapstick violence and alcohol while in character.\\n\\nRogers also works with property, doing construction work and then selling the property, as well as admitting he does a lot of DIY work at his own home. He is also a very highly respected photographer having had three books of his work published.\\n\\nWorldwide Success:\\nHis success is worldwide. For example, he has played many well-attended concerts in Europe and the Far East, where he has charted numerous singles and albums from the 1970s through to the present day. New Zealand was a big stronghold during his First Edition days, being the only country to give them the acclaim they truly deserved. His 1985 greatest-hits package, \"The Kenny Rogers Story,\" reached #1 on the British country chart -- and four years later (in 1989), was still at #2. He also charted internationally during that time with a series of studio albums.\\n\\nIn 1983, Rogers signed to RCA for a record breaking US$20 million advance. Although, following the success of his label debut, The Bee Gees produced Eyes That See In The Dark album, some critics noted that Rogers wasn\\'t doing as well as in previous years. Nonetheless, he was still among the worlds top stars. Between 1983 and 1990 alone he charted no less than 23 top 40 singles and 10 top 40 albums.\\n\\nSuccess in the 1990s:\\nIn 1990s Rogers continued to chart with singles such as Crazy In Love, If You Want To Find Love and The Greatest. From 1991 to 1994, Rogers hosted The Real West on A&E (Moved to The History Channel in 1995.). In 1994, Rogers released his \"dream\" album titled Timepiece on Atlantic Records. It consisted of 30\\'s and 40\\'s jazz standards; it was the type of music he performed in his early days with The Bobby Doyle Three in Houston. In 1996 he released an album Vote For Love where the public requested their favorite love songs and Kenny performed the songs (several of his own hits were in there). The album was the first for the TV shopping channel QVC\\'s record label, onQ Music. The album (sold exclusively by QVC) was a huge success and was later issued in stores under a variety of different titles, but never titled Vote For Love.\\n\\nHe has been married five times. His fourth wife was the actress Marianne Gordon Rogers. His current wife is the former Wanda Miller. He has a daughter and four sons, including twins born while Rogers was 65.\\n\\nBeyond the 1990s:\\nIn the 21st century, Rogers was back at #1 for the first time in almost a decade with the single \"Buy Me A Rose\", making him the oldest artist in the history of country music to reach the chart summit. He also released the critically acclaimed album \"Back To The Well.\"\\n\\nThough Kenny didn\\'t record new albums for a couple of years he continued to have success in many countries with more greatest hits packages, in 2004 \"42 Ultimate Hits\", which was the first hits collection to span his days with the first edition to the present, reached Number 6 in the American country charts and went gold. In 2005 \"The Very Best Of Kenny Rogers\", a double album, sold well in Europe. It was the first new solo Kenny Rogers hit\\'s album to reach the United Kingdom for over a decade, despite many compilations there that were not true hits packages.\\n\\nKenny also signed with Capitol Nashville Records and had more success with the TV advertised release \"21 Number Ones\" in January 2006. Although this CD did contain 21 chart-toppers as the title claims (recorded between 1976 and the present day), this was not a complete collection of Rogers #1 singles, omitting such singles as Crazy In Love and What About Me?.\\n\\nA lot of his success was with Capitol from 1976 to 1983 (called United Artists/Liberty at the time). It is very rare for an artist of Rogers\\' age to be signed to a major label. Capitol followed \"21 Number Ones\" with Rogers\\' new studio album, \"Water And Bridges,\" in March 2006 on the Capitol Nashville label, the first single from the album was \"I Can\\'t Unlove You\" which made #20 on the country charts, after spending over 6 months on the hit list, more than 50 years after he formed his first group and 38 years after his first major hit as leader of The First Edition, showing Kenny\\'s long durance in the music world. After a six-decade-long career, Rogers retired in 2017. He died three year after, on March 20, 2020. \\n\\nDeath\\nOn March 20, 2020, Rogers died under hospice care at his home in Sandy Springs, Georgia, a representative for the singer said in a statement. Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the family are planning a small private service with a public memorial planned for a later date.\\n\\nSelected discography\\n\\nAlbums:\\nWith The First Edition\\nThe First Edition (1967) \\nThe First Edition\\'s Second (1968) \\nThe First Edition \\'69 (1969) \\nRuby, Don\\'t Take Your Love To Town (1969) \\nSomething\\'s Burning (1970) \\nTell It All Brother (1970) \\nTransition (1971) \\nThe Ballad of Calico (1972) \\nBack Roads (1972) \\nRollin (1973) \\nMonumental (1973) \\nI\\'m Not Making Music For Money (1974 NZ only release with exclusive tracks) \\n\\nSolo:\\nLove Lifted Me (United Artists 1975) \\nKenny Rogers (United Artists 1976) \\nDaytime Friends (United Artists 1977) \\nLove Or Something Like It (United Artists 1978) \\nThe Gambler (United Artists 1978) \\nEvery Time Two Fools Collide (Kenny Rogers and Dottie West) (United Artists 1978) \\nKenny (United Artists 1979) \\nClassics (Kenny Rogers and Dottie West) (United Artists 1979) \\nGideon (United Artists 1980) \\nChristmas (Liberty 1981) \\nShare Your Love (Liberty 1981) \\nLove Will Turn You Around (Liberty 1982) \\nWe\\'ve Got Tonight (Liberty 1983) \\nEyes That See In The Dark (RCA 1983) \\nWhat About Me?

Music.\") is best known for his 2016 summer hit \"Broccoli.\" Born Shelley Marshaun Massenburg-Smith in Germany, the Virginia-based artist released his debut mixtape, #1 Epic Summer, in 2014. It featured the single \"Cha Cha,\" a club-worthy cut that was a regional hit. In 2015, he broke on a national scale when Cleveland R&B radio station Z 107.9 FM began playing the cut as their \"weekend warmer,\" a campaign that eventually reached Beyoncé, who shared a video of her own version of the track. With Queen B\\'s co-sign, \"Cha Cha\" was re-released that year while #1 Epic reappeared as an EP. Following the increased exposure brought on by \"Cha Cha\"\\'s success, D.R.A.M. released another mixtape, the aptly titled Gahdamn! in October 2015. Months later, he scored a hit with the Lil\\' Yachty-assisted \"Broccoli.\" The track went gold and had risen into the Billboard Top 40 by the time summer rolled around in 2016. That October, D.R.A.M. issued his debut LP, Big Baby D.R.A.M. Debuting in the Top 20, the effort included \"Broccoli,\" as well as guest appearances by Erykah Badu and Young Thug.

       " '\\nFrancis Albert Sinatra (December 12, 1915 – May 14, 1998) was an American singer, actor, and producer who was one of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century. He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide. \\n\\nBorn in Hoboken, New Jersey, to Italian immigrants, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"bobby soxers\". He released his debut album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra, in 1946. Sinatra\\'s professional career had stalled by the early 1950s, and he turned to Las Vegas, where he became one of its best known residency performers as part of The Rat Pack. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of From Here to Eternity, with his performance subsequently winning an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including In the Wee Small Hours (1955), Songs for Swingin\\' Lovers! (1956), Come Fly with Me (1958), Only the Lonely (1958) and Nice \\'n\\' Easy (1960).\\n\\nSinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, Reprise Records, and released a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective September of My Years, starred in the Emmy-winning television special Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music, and released the tracks \"Strangers in the Night\" and \"My Way\". After releasing Sinatra at the Sands, recorded at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Vegas with frequent collaborator Count Basie in early 1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Tom Jobim, the album Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim. It was followed by 1968\\'s collaboration with Duke Ellington. Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971, but came out of retirement two years later and recorded several albums and resumed performing at Caesars Palace, and reached success in 1980 with \"New York, New York\". Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally until a short time before his death in 1998.\\n\\nSinatra forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for From Here to Eternity, he starred in The Man with the Golden Arm (1955), and received critical acclaim for his performance in The Manchurian Candidate (1962). He appeared in various musicals such as On the Town (1949), Guys and Dolls (1955), High Society (1956), and Pal Joey (1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter. Toward the end of his career, he became associated with playing detectives, including the title character in Tony Rome (1967). Sinatra would later receive the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971. On television, The Frank Sinatra Show began on ABC in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such as Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, though before Kennedy\\'s death Sinatra\\'s alleged Mafia connections led to his being snubbed.\\n\\nWhile Sinatra never formally learned how to read music, he had an impressive understanding of it, and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. A perfectionist, renowned for his dress sense and performing presence, he always insisted on recording live with his band. His bright blue eyes earned him the popular nickname \"Ol\\' Blue Eyes\". Sinatra led a colorful personal life, and was often involved in turbulent affairs with women, such as with his second wife Ava Gardner. He went on to marry Mia Farrow in 1966 and Barbara Marx in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, usually with journalists he felt had crossed him, or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. After his death, American music critic Robert Christgau called him \"the greatest singer of the 20th century\", and he continues to be seen as an iconic figure.\\n\\nSinatra died with his wife at his side at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on May 14, 1998, aged 82, after a heart attack. Sinatra had ill health during the last few years of his life, and was frequently hospitalized for heart and breathing problems, high blood pressure, pneumonia and bladder cancer. He was further diagnosed as having dementia. He had made no public appearances following a heart attack in February 1997. Sinatra\\'s wife encouraged him to \"fight\" while attempts were made to stabilize him, and his final words were, \"I\\'m losing.\" Sinatra\\'s daughter, Tina, later wrote that she and her sister, Nancy, had not been notified of their father\\'s final hospitalization, and it was her belief that \"the omission was deliberate. Barbara would be the grieving widow alone at her husband\\'s side.\" The night after Sinatra\\'s death, the lights on the Empire State Building in New York City were turned blue, the lights at the Las Vegas Strip were dimmed in his honor, and the casinos stopped spinning for a minute.\\n\\nSinatra\\'s funeral was held at the Roman Catholic Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills, California, on May 20, 1998, with 400 mourners in attendance and thousands of fans outside. Gregory Peck, Tony Bennett, and Sinatra\\'s son, Frank Jr., addressed the mourners, who included many notable people from film and entertainment. Sinatra was buried in a blue business suit with mementos from family members—cherry-flavored Life Savers, Tootsie Rolls, a bottle of Jack Daniel\\'s, a pack of Camel cigarettes, a Zippo lighter, stuffed toys, a dog biscuit, and a roll of dimes that he always carried—next to his parents in section B-8 of Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California.\\n\\nHis close friends Jilly Rizzo and Jimmy Van Heusen are buried nearby. The words \"The Best Is Yet to Come\", plus \"Beloved Husband & Father\" are imprinted on Sinatra\\'s grave marker. Significant increases in recording sales worldwide were reported by Billboard in the month of his death. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Sinatra\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'DJ Quik (born David Martin Blake on January 18, 1970) is a West Coast rapper and record producer from Compton, California. He was raised at 436 West Spruce Street in Compton, California. As a teen he took up an affiliation with the Tree Top Piru Bloods, hence why his name is spelled Quik with the C conspicuously missing. A lot of Bloods would let the name \"Quick\" (because CK stands for Crip Killer) but he chose \"Quik\" to represent the Red but at the same time in some form of respect for the other side . He grew up without a father and moved out of his mother\\'s home when he was only 17. He lived in the house as the only male with 8 sisters. His home life was far from stable as he raps in a song that one of his sisters was selling drugs to one of his other sisters. He began selling homemade mixtapes (like \"The Red Tape\", 1987) after he received a turntable for his 9th grade graduation and then began doing shows DJing around Southern California when he moved out. He signed to Profile Records in the summer of 1990, reportedly as the label\\'s first six figure signee. Not only could he rap and write his own songs, he could produce as well.\\n\\nHis debut album, \"Quik Is The Name\" was led by the success of two top 20 R&B singles, \"Tonite\" and \"Born and Raised in Compton.\" \"Tonite\" even charted on the pop charts. The album ended up reaching 10th on the album charts. None of his successive albums reached the success of his debut, though they have been well received in California, particularly his 1998 release \"Rhythm-Al-Ism.\" His most popular albums are Quik Is The Name and Safe + Sound. . On \"Safe + Sound\" appears \"Dollaz And Sense,\" which was a diss track to Compton rapper and member of the rival Tragniew Park Crips MC Eiht. Though full of bravado at the time, Quik now admits to fearing for his life during the period.\\n\\nInstead of joining the G-Funk movement during the 1990\\'s, DJ Quik had his own style that a new version of P-Funk, inspired by artists like Roger Troutman (who even taught him the use of the talkbox, which became a trademark for Quik\\'s sound in the 1990\\'s) and George Clinton. Throughout his career, Quik has collaborated with and produced for artists including 2Pac (\"Heartz of Men\", \"Words To My First Born\", \"Late Night\"), Janet Jackson (\"All For You\"), Snoop Dogg (e.g. \"Doin\\' Too Much\", \"Buss\\'n Rocks\", \"Don\\'t Tell\"), Talib Kweli (\"Put It In The Air\"), Whitney Houston (\"Fine\"), Kurupt (\"Can\\'t Go Wrong\"), Jay-Z (\"Justify My Thug\"), Xzibit (\"Sorry I\\'m Away So Much\"), Ludacris (\"Spur of the Moment\"), Chingy (\"Bagg Up\", and \"Wurr\\'s My Cash\"),Dr. Dre, 2nd II None, Hi-C, Suga Free (\"Street Gospel\" album and on the \"New Testament\" album), 8Ball & MJG (\"Buck Bounce\") and others. Though he formally produced only \"Heartz of Men\" on 2Pac\\'s masterpiece \"All Eyez On Me\" album, he went uncredited for work on many other tracks on the album; on that track he used his real name David Blake, because Profile did not allow him to use his stage name. In 2002, he produced Truth Hurts\\' Top 10 pop hit \"Addictive\". Quik used an uncleared Hindi sample on the record, and the copyright holders eventually filed a $500 million dollar lawsuit against Truth Hurts\\' label, Aftermath Entertainment.\\n\\nQuik faced personal and professional tragedy when his friend and protegé Mausberg was murdered on the 4th of July, 2000. This was compounded by the death of his best friend Daryl Reed soon after.\\n\\nFollowing 2000\\'s \"Balance and Options\" CD he was dropped by Arista Records which in 1998 had bought Profile Records. In September 2005, DJ Quik released his first independent album on his own new label, Mad Science, which was supposed to be distributed by Warner Bros but Quik was forced to let Time Warner and so signed his Mad Science with Fontana/Universal. The album is titled \"Trauma\" and reflects the turmoil in the producer\\'s life over the past few years. He than released \"Trauma: Instrumentals\". In recent years he has worked with a 74 piece orchestra during a collaboration with Marcus Miller while working on the score to the movie \"Head of State.\" Over the years, Quik has morphed from a hardcore gangsta rapper to a mainstream producer and rapper who is not afraid to change his style. He has not abandoned his West Coast roots and now produces very much his own unique style. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Quik\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He found fame as a member of the pop group Take That from 1990 to 1995, and achieved commercial success after launching a solo career in 1996. His debut studio album, Life thru a Lens, was released in 1997, and included his signature song, \"Angels\". His second album, I\\'ve Been Expecting You, featured the songs \"Millennium\" and \"She\\'s the One\", his first number one singles. His discography includes seven UK No. 1 singles, and all but one of his 14 studio albums have reached No. 1 in the UK. Six of his albums are among the top 100 biggest-selling albums in the UK, with two of them in the top 60, and he gained a Guinness World Record in 2006 for selling 1.6 million tickets in a single day during his Close Encounters Tour.\\n\\nWilliams has received a record 18 Brit Awards, winning Best British Male Artist four times, Outstanding Contribution to Music twice, an Icon Award for his lasting impact on British culture, eight German ECHO Awards, and three MTV European Music Awards. In 2004, he was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame after being voted the Greatest Artist of the 1990s. According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), he has been certified for 20.2 million albums and 8.66 million singles in the UK as a solo artist. Five of his albums have also topped the Australian albums chart, and has sold 75 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He also topped the 2000–2010 UK airplay chart. His three concerts at Knebworth in 2003 drew over 375,000 people, the UK\\'s biggest music event to that point. In 2014, he was awarded the freedom of his hometown of Stoke-on-Trent and had a tourist trail created and streets named in his honour. Williams\\' thirteenth album, XXV was released on 9 September 2022.\\n\\nAfter 15 years, Williams rejoined Take That in 2010 to co-write and perform lead vocals on their album Progress, which became the second-fastest-selling album in UK chart history and the fastest-selling record of the century at the time. The subsequent stadium tour, which featured seven songs from Williams\\' solo career, became the biggest-selling concert in UK history when it sold 1.34 million tickets in less than 24 hours. In 2011, Take That frontman Gary Barlow confirmed that Williams had left the band for a second time to focus on his solo career, although he stated that the departure was amicable and that Williams was welcome to rejoin Take That in the future. Williams has since performed with Take That on three separate television appearances, and collaborated with Barlow on a number of projects such as the West End musical The Band.\\n\\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Williams\\n\\nStudio albums\\nLife thru a Lens (1997)\\nI\\'ve Been Expecting You (1998)\\nSing When You\\'re Winning (2000)\\nSwing When You\\'re Winning (2001)\\nEscapology (2002)\\nIntensive Care (2005)\\nRudebox (2006)\\nReality Killed the Video Star (2009)\\nTake the Crown (2012)\\nSwings Both Ways (2013)\\nThe Heavy Entertainment Show (2016)\\nThe Christmas Present (2019)\\nXXV (2022) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Robbie+Williams\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Earl Simmons (December 18, 1970 - April 9, 2021), better known by his stage name DMX (Dark Man X), was an American rapper from Yonkers, New York and actor signed to Ruff Ryders Entertainment. In 1998 he released his debut solo album, It\\'s Dark and Hell Is Hot, and has since released 1998\\'s Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood, 1999\\'s ...And Then There Was X, 2001\\'s The Great Depression, 2003\\'s Grand Champ and 2006\\'s Year of the Dog...Again. \\n\\nDMX died on April 9, 2021 in White Plains, New York, after he was hospitalized on April 2 following a reported heart attack.\\n\\nBiography\\n\\nEarl Simmons was the second of three children of a single mother, and was born in Mount Vernon, New York Simmons ended up growing up in the School Street housing projects of Yonkers, New York. He began rapping around the age of 13, amusing crowds of children with rhymes that relied on spelled-out words, a style he called \"spellbound.\" A local rapper eventually asked the young Earl to beatbox for him, and Simmons agreed, adopting the stage name DMX, which stands for \"Dark Man of the Unknown,\" X being an algebraic expression for unknown. But at the time, stood for a drum system that delivered amazing beats. Eventually he decided to try his hand at serious rapping, and honed his skills during a stint at a group home. He also got into fights and frequently was on the run from police. During this period, he also began doing shows and battling other rappers (Once battling and defeating Jay-Z), making a name for himself in the New York area. He released his first album called \"DMX: Unleashed and Unreleased\" which was an instant hit on the streets of Yonkers. He was also featured in the Unsigned Hype section of The Source in 1988.\\n\\nHe stated he wanted to be a preacher when he retires from his rapping career as he stated in his reality TV Show DMX: Soul Of A Man.\\n\\nDMX was a fan of the Pit Bull type dogs (American Pit Bull Terriers and American Staffordshire Terriers). He had a tattoo of one of his deceased dogs, on his back, which read \"One Love Boomer\". He later contributed over $1 million to the United Negro Association for unfortunate black children in New York City..\\n\\nRecording career\\n\\nIn and out of jail, DMX decided to focus solely on his rap career. He began seriously looking for a deal and linked up with Pete McCormick Schaub, an A&R for Small Island at the time. Eventually, he signed a management deal with Ruff Ryders. They negotiated deals with both Bad Boy and Death Row Records, but he eventually landed at Def Jam. He is currently at Sony BMG, set to release his first of three albums on August 1st 2006. Rumors also arose that DMX had signed for 50 Cent\\'s G-Unit Records, but were dismissed in a public news conference.\\n\\nIt\\'s Dark and Hell Is Hot\\n\\nBefore It\\'s Dark and Hell Is Hot, DMX released the single \"Born Loser\" which was banned on MTV due to the video\\'s graphic images. DMX\\'s debut single was \"Get At Me Dog\", which was an instant hit. His critically-acclaimed debut album, It\\'s Dark and Hell Is Hot, is often credited with revitalizing Hardcore Rap in the mainstream scene, after the death of Tupac Shakur, and after Puff Daddy and Bad Boy Entertainment briefly dominated the charts with their pop-oriented and sample-reliant tunes.\\n\\nIn 1997, DMX earned a second major-label shot with Def Jam, and made a successful guest appearance on LL Cool J\\'s \"4, 3, 2, 1.\" Additional guest spots on Ma$e\\'s \"24 Hours to Live\" and fellow Yonkers MCs the The LOX\\'s \"Money, Power, & Respect\" created an even stronger buzz, and in early 1998, he released his debut Def Jam single, \"Get At Me Dog.\" The song went gold and was a hit on the rap and dance charts. The single paved the way for DMX to release his classic first full-length album, It\\'s Dark and Hell Is Hot, which debuted as number one on the pop charts.\\n\\nProduced mostly by Damon \"Dame Grease\" Blackman, (Swizz Beatz produced the \"Ruff Ryders\\' Anthem\", paving the way for future projects between the two). It\\'s Dark and Hell Is Hot earned DMX numerous comparisons to Tupac Shakur for his booming and aggressive presence on the mic. The album went on to sell over four million copies and earned him credit for revitalizing Hardcore Rap after the deaths of Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. Shortly after the album\\'s release in May 1998, DMX was accused of raping a stripper in the Bronx, but was later cleared by DNA evidence. He made his film debut together with Nas and Method Man in Hype Williams\\' mildly successful film Belly. Although not a critical success, the film found a strong following with hip hop audiences.\\n\\nFlesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood\\n\\nDMX completed his second album before the end of 1998, and a pending buyout of Def Jam pushed the record into stores December 15. Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood entered the charts at number one and eventually went triple platinum. This number one hit made DMX the first rapper to have two number one albums in the same year. The cover photo of the rapper covered in pig\\'s blood caused some controversy. The single \"Slippin\\'\" became his first chart hit in the UK. DMX hit the road with Jay-Z and the Method Man/Redman team on the blockbuster Hard Knock Life tour the following year. He had a song called \"Jack Moves\" with the legendary rap group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, but the song did not appear on the album.\\n\\n...And Then There Was X\\n\\nDMX released his third album on December 21, 1999, ...And Then There Was X, which was his third straight album to debut at number one. Party Up was his biggest single since \"Get at Me Dog\" which became his first Top Ten hit on the R&B charts. His next singles off the album, \"What\\'s My Name\" & \"What These Bitches Want\" feat. Sisqó were also popular. ...And Then There Was X is the rapper\\'s best-selling album to date, going 6x platinum and 9x platinum worldwide, & one of the fastest made by DMX : Def Jam urged him to realise the tracks within a month, while DMX used to take a year to write songs.\\n\\nThe Great Depression\\n\\nAfter resolving his legal problems, DMX returned to the studio and completed his fourth album, The Great Depression. Released October 3, 2001, it was DMX\\'s fourth straight album to debut at number one. The album demonstrated his still strong allegiance with the Ruff Ryders. The Great Depression went platinum quickly, but lacked the staying power of his previous releases.\\n\\nGrand Champ\\n\\nReleased in 2003, Grand Champ was DMX\\'s fifth straight album to debut at number one, extending DMX\\'s position as the only artist in history to have 5 albums (his entire album catalog at that point) debut at #1. Fans and critics claimed disappointment with the album, most stating that it felt formulaic. After its release, DMX informed the public that he planned on retiring from the rap game and that Grand Champ would be his final album. He later ended his brief retirement and announced his plans to record the album Year of the Dog...Again. It debuted with approximately 125,000 albums sold, but failed to give DMX a sixth consecutive #1 album. The album is his lowest selling to date, and has yet to reach Gold in the U.S.\\n\\nYear of the Dog...Again\\n\\nReleased August 1st 2006, Year of the Dog...Again had numerous problems due to DMX switching record labels, as well as numerous delays. The album\\'s five predeccesors debuted at #1, while this album missed the top spot by only a few thousand sales. In March, 2006 it was announced that the album had been renamed to \"Year of the Dog, Again,\" from \"Here We Go, Again.\" When DMX switched to Sony, Def Jam allowed him to keep all of the tracks he had created for the album. It was reported that most of the tracks were being reworked, with updated production, however the reworked album has also been leaked. DMX has also appeared on Busta Rhymes\\' \"Touch It (The Remix)\". He has also released his new singles \"Lord Give Me A Sign\", and \"We In Here\" feat. Swizz Beatz, which are included in \"Year of the Dog...Again\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/DMX\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Wesley Eric Weston, Jr. (born March 3, 1981), better known by his stage name Lil\\' Flip, is a multi-Platinum American rapper. He is known for his freestyle ability and claims to have been on 1000 mixtapes.\\n\\nLil\\' Flip\\'s career was launched when he released his first album \"The Leprechaun\". The album quickly gained national attention and spawned the hit single \"I Can Do That\". The album sold over 100,000 copies regionally and gained attention from Def Jam South, A & R, and well-known Houston rapper Scarface. He was briefly signed to Def Jam, but abruptly left the label a few years later after concerns about his financial earnings. He soon signed to Loud Records and began recording his first national debut album.\\n\\nWhile recording his album, he was apparently shot by unknown assailants in a drive-by shooting. He survived the attack and pressed on to finish the album. At the age of 20, Lil\\' Flip released his sophomore album \"Undaground Legend\", his first nationally released album, which included the hit single \"The Way We Ball\" and a remix to his hit \"I Can Do That\". The album reached platinum status even though it didn\\'t get much promotion from Loud Records.\\n\\nLil\\' Flip recorded his third album \"U Gotta Feel Me\" on Sony Records. This album was more commercial and featured Ludacris, Three 6 Mafia, and others. The album debuted at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and #3 on the Hip-Hop/R&B charts. It quickly became a crossover success with the Billboard Hot 100 Top 20 single \"Game Over\". The single used the Namco Pac-Man beat and the video showed Lil\\' Flip getting a tattoo while rapping to the single. The single reached #1 on the hip-hop charts. His follow-up single, the lover\\'s anthem \"Sunshine\" featuring Lea, became the second hit single on Lil\\' Flip\\'s album and went to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100. It gained numerous requests on MTV 2 and BET. The album was certified double platinum.\\n\\nLil\\' Flip is known for his unique screwed style of freestyling (a form of slowed down rap technique) and for always releasing double disc CDs whenever he releases an album. He credits all of his success to the late DJ Screw and has tattooed DJ Screw\\'s name on his arms. Lil\\' Flip has been credited for his lyrics by Three 6 Mafia, David Banner, Fam-Lay, Young Buck, UGK, Ludacris, among others. He has announced himself as the \"King of The South\" and the \"Freestyle King\".   <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lil%27+Flip\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Shawntae Harris (born April 14, 1974), better known as Da Brat, is an American rapper and actress. Her debut album, Funkdafied, sold one million copies making her the first female rapper to have a platinum-selling album.Regarding her soon-to-be rap name, Harris told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that she got the name because she is \"a spoiled only child.\" Harris is the half-sister of actress LisaRaye McCoy\\n\\nIn 1992, Harris got a big break when she won the grand prize in a local rap contest sponsored by Yo! MTV Raps. For the prize, she got to meet Kris Kross, and they in turn introduced her to their producer, Jermaine Dupri, who signed her to his So So Def label. Dupri cultivated Da Brat\\'s image as a \"female Snoop Doggy Dogg\", and she became one of the first female \"reality-based\" rappers.\\n\\nDa Brat\\'s debut album Funkdafied was released in 1994 and entered the rap albums chart at Number #1. The album went platinum, which made her the first female solo rapper to sell one million units. The single also entitled \"Funkdafied\" reached #1 on the rap singles chart and #6 on the Billboard Hot 100. She had a follow-up hit from the same album, \"Give It 2 You\", which reached #26 on the Hot 100.\\n\\nIn 1996, Da Brat released her second full-length album, Anuthatantrum, which included the single \"Ghetto Love\" featuring T-Boz of TLC.\\n\\nDuring the rest of the \\'90s, Da Brat came to be known more for her \"featured\" appearances on other rappers\\' and R&B singers\\' albums rather than for her own solo work. She contributed a rhyme to the hip hop remix of Mariah Carey\\'s hit, \"Always Be My Baby\". She also made her feature film debut that year in Kazaam with Shaquille O\\'Neal. During the summer of 1997, Da Brat appeared along with Dupri on a remix of Carey\\'s \"Honey (So So Def mix)\" and recorded the hit remix of \"Ladies\\' Night (Not Tonight)\" with Lil\\' Kim, Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes, Angie Martinez and Missy Elliott. Da Brat was also featured with Kris Kross on their track \"Da Bomb\" on the album Da Bomb, as well as on their third album Young, Rich and Dangerous.\\n\\nIn 1997, she was featured on \"Sock It 2 Me\", a track on Missy Elliott\\'s debut album, Supa Dupa Fly. In 1999, she appeared, alongside Krayzie Bone, on the remix to Mariah Carey\\'s cover of Brenda K. Starr\\'s \"I Still Believe\". She also appeared as a guest artist with Elliott on Carey\\'s remix of \"Heartbreaker\", and on the remix of Brandy\\'s \"U Don\\'t Know Me (Like U Used To)\". That year, she was also featured on a remix of the Destiny\\'s Child single \"Jumpin\\', Jumpin\\'\".\\n\\nIn early 2000, Da Brat released her third full-length album Unrestricted, which produced the moderately successful singles \"That\\'s What I\\'m Looking For\" (U.S. #56) and \"What Chu Like\" (U.S. #26), featuring soul singer, Tyrese. The album was not well received compared to Brat\\'s earlier work. However, the new album and new millennium did inspire an image makeover for Da Brat. Abandoning her \"gangsta\" persona, she decided to follow the trend in popular music and attempted to add to her sex appeal; the video for \"What Chu Like\" featured Da Brat and Tyrese rolling around naked on a beach.\\n\\nIn 2001, Brat continued her trend of being featured on other artist\\'s remixes, reaching #1 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip Hop Singles chart along with rapper Ludacris on the main remix of Mariah Carey\\'s \"Loverboy\" and being featured artist on Destiny\\'s Child\\'s \"Survivor\" remix. Da Brat also appeared as Louise in Carey\\'s 2001 movie Glitter. In 2003, Brat released her fourth album, titled Limelite, Luv & Niteclubz, and appeared on the 4th season of VH1\\'s The Surreal Life.\\n\\nIn 2001, Da Brat pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless conduct after she had beaten a woman with a gun during a dispute over VIP seating in a Buckhead, Georgia, nightclub in 2000. The victim in that incident received six stitches for a head wound. Harris ended up serving a year\\'s probation, performed 80 hours of community service and paid a $1,000 fine.\\n\\nIn 2005, she made a comeback of sorts when she was featured on the remix to the song \"I Think They Like Me,\" by Dem Franchize Boyz, which also featured Bow Wow and Jermaine Dupri. The song peaked at #1 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip Hop Singles chart and #15 on the Billboard Hot 100.\\n\\nIn 2006, she was an onstage guest on Mariah Carey\\'s The Adventures of Mimi Tour in Atlanta, New York City, Long Island, Washington DC, Chicago, and Los Angeles performing her rap verses on the \"Heartbreaker\" and \"Honey\" remixes. She was also featured on Kelly Rowland\\'s \"Gotsta Go\", a bonus track from her 2007 album Ms. Kelly and is also featured on a bonus track from Carey\\'s E=MC² on a track entitled \"4real4real\". She also co-wrote a song with Mariah Carey called \"O.O.C.\" which appears on E=MC² and contributes backing vocals on the track.In 2007, she participated in the fifth season of the VH1 reality series Celebrity Fit Club.\\n\\nOn October 31, 2007, she was involved in the altercation that ended in assault at a Halloween party at Studio 72 nightclub in Tucker, Georgia. Harris sparred verbally with a hostess, and later, when the hostess proceeded to talk to her manager, Harris attacked her from behind, striking her in the face with a rum bottle. Harris entered a guilty plea to aggravated assault charges. She was sentenced to three years in prison, seven years of probation, and 200 hours of community service. In May 2010 she was released from prison after serving 21 months.\\n\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Da+Brat\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Bald-headed Da Hool (real name Frank Tomiczek) was a child of the exploding German club scene of the late \\'80s. Born and raised in the largely working-class town of Bottrop, it was here where he first wowed the crowds with his skills behind the turntables. By 1990, he was already being touted as one of the nation\\'s finest men on the decks and, that same year, moved into production. His early works, released under the moniker DJ Hooligan, included the popular club numbers \"B.O.T.T.R.O.P.\" and \"It\\'s a Dream Song,\" and the dance charts winner \"Rave Nation.\" In 1996, he launched his own label, B-sides, and changed his name to Da Hool. That same year, he released the infectious rave single \"Meet Her at the Love Parade.\" However, it was not until a year later, when the tune was re-released on Germany\\'s legendary Kosmo Records label (responsible for such acts as Novy vs Eniac), that it became a chart topper. It sold more than 6,000,000 copies around the globe. Soon after came Da Hool\\'s next offering, another rave single titled \"Bora Bora\"; named after a beach on the Spanish party island of Ibiza, the track was a popular club tune in many countries and a hit on the German charts. In 1999, he released his first LP, the aptly titled Here Comes Da Hool.\\n\\nBottrop, Germany <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Da+Hool\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " 'Serge Gainsbourg (April 2, 1928 – March 2, 1991) was a French poet-songwriter, singer, actor, novelist, painter and director. Gainsbourg\\'s varied style and individuality made him difficult to categorize. Although famous in France for many years, he did not achieve his first No. 1 album until 1979, when he released Aux Armes et caetera more than twenty years after his music career had begun. But since the 1980s, his legacy has been firmly established.\\n\\nHe was born Lucien Ginzburg in Paris, France, the son of Jewish Russian parents who fled to France after the 1917 Bolshevik uprising. His childhood was profoundly affected by the occupation of France by Nazi Germany, during which he and his family, as Jews, were forced to wear the yellow star and eventually flee from Paris. He had a daughter, Charlotte Gainsbourg, with English singer and actress Jane Birkin; and a son, Lulu, with his last partner, Bambou (Caroline Von Paulus, who is related to Friedrich Paulus). Before he was 30 years old, Lucien Ginsburg was a disillusioned painter but earned his living as a piano player in bars. Daughter Charlotte would later become an actress and singer.\\n\\nHis early songs were influenced by Boris Vian and were largely in the vein of \"old-fashioned\" chanson. Very early, however, Gainsbourg began to move beyond this and experiment with a succession of different musical styles: jazz early on, English pop in the 60\\'s, reggae in the 70\\'s, even hip-hop in the 80\\'s.\\n\\nSuccess began to arrive when, in 1965, his song \"Poupée de cire, poupée de son\" was the Luxembourg entry in the Eurovision Song Contest. Performed by French teen singer France Gall, it won the grand prize. (The song was covered in English as \"A Lonely Singing Doll\" by British teen idol Twinkle.) He arranged other Gall songs and LPs that were characteristic of the late 1960s psychedelic styles, among them Gall\\'s \\'1968\\' album. Another of Serge\\'s songs \"Boum Bada Boum\" was entered in by Monaco in the 1967 contest, sung by Minouche Barelli; It came 5th.\\n\\nIn 1969, he released what would become his most famous song in the English-speaking world, \"Je t\\'aime... moi non plus\", which featured simulated sounds of female orgasm. The song appeared that year on an LP, \"Jane Birkin/Serge Gainsbourg\". Originally recorded with Brigitte Bardot, it was released with future girlfriend Birkin when Bardot backed out. While Gainsbourg declared it the \"ultimate love song,\" it was considered too \"hot\"; the song was censored in various countries, and in France, even the toned-down version was suppressed. Even the Vatican made a public statement citing the song as offensive. Its notoriety led it to reaching no. 1 in the UK singles chart. A long-standing rumor maintains that Gainsbourg and Birkin were actually having sex during the recording session (asked about it in an interview, Gainsbourg answered that if this was true, the song would have lasted longer than 4 minutes).\\n\\nThe seventies\\nHis most influential work came near the start of the seventies with Histoire de Melody Nelson, released in 1971. This concept album, produced and arranged by Jean-Claude Vannier, tells the story of a Lolita-esque affair, with Gainsbourg as the narrator and Jane Birkin as the eponymous English heroine. It features prominent string arrangements and even a massed choir at its tragic climax. At the time, sales were poor, but the album has proven influential with artists such as Air, David Holmes and Beck.\\n\\nIn 1975, he released the album Rock Around the Bunker, a rock album written entirely on the subject of the Nazis. Gainsbourg used black humour, as he and his family suffered during World War II. While a child in Paris, Gainsbourg himself had worn the Yellow badge as the mark of a Jew.\\nThe next year saw the release of another major work, L\\'Homme à la Tête de Chou (Cabbage-Head Man), featuring the new character Marilou and sumptuous orchestral themes.\\nIn Jamaica in 1978 he recorded \"Aux Armes et cetera,\" a reggae version of the French national anthem \"La Marseillaise\", with Robbie Shakespeare, Sly Dunbar and Rita Marley. This song earned him death threats from right-wing veterans of the Algerian War of Independence who were opposed to certain lyrics. Shortly afterwards, Gainsbourg bought the original manuscript of La Marseillaise. He was able to reply to his critics that his version was, in fact, closer to the original as the manuscript clearly shows the words \"Aux armes et cætera...\" for the chorus.\\n\\nThe next year saw him in the new look of Gainsbarre, officially introduced in the song \"Ecce Homo.\"\\n\\nFinal years\\nIn the 1980\\'s, approaching the end of his life, Gainsbourg became a regular figure on French TV. His appearances seemed devoted to his controversial sense of humour and provocation. He would frequently show up drunk and unshaven on stage. Perhaps his most famous incident came when, on Michel Drucker\\'s live Saturday evening show with the American singer Whitney Houston, he exclaimed, \"I want to fuck her.\"\\n\\nDuring this period he released Love On The Beat and his last studio album, You\\'re Under Arrest, (which saw him adapt his style to the hip-hop genre), as well as two live recordings. His third and last Eurovision Song Contest entry came in 1990 with the French entry \"White and Black Blues\", sung by Joëlle Ursull. It came second in a tie with Ireland. His songs became increasingly eccentric in this period, ranging from the anti-drug \"Les Enfants de la Chance\" to the duet with his daughter Charlotte called \"Lemon Incest (Un zeste de citron).\" The title of the latter demonstrates Gainsbourg\\'s love of puns (another example is \"Bowie, Beau oui comme Bowie\").\\n\\nDiscography : \\n\\n1958 : Du Chant À La Une ! \\n1959 : Serge Gainsbourg N°2 \\n1961 : L\\'étonnant Serge Gainsbourg \\n1962 : Serge Gainsbourg N° 4 \\n1963 : Gainsbourg Confidentiel \\n1964 : Gainsbourg Percussions \\n1968 : Initials B.B. \\n1968 : Bonnie And Clyde ( with Brigitte Bardot )\\n1969 : Jane Birkin-Serge Gainsbourg \\n1971 : Histoire de Melody Nelson ( with Jane Birkin )\\n1973 : Vu de l\\'extérieur \\n1975 : Rock around the bunker \\n1976 : L\\'Homme à tête de chou \\n1979 : Aux armes et cætera \\n1981 : Mauvaises Nouvelles Des Étoiles \\n1984 : Love on the Beat \\n1987 : You\\'re Under Arrest \\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Serge+Gainsbourg\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       "      <th>Richard Arnold \"Groove\" Holmes, Born Richard Arnold Jackson(Camden, New Jersey, May 2, 1931 – St. Louis, Missouri, June 29, 1991) was an American jazz organist who performed in the hard bop and soul jazz genre. He is best known for his 1965 recording of \"Misty,\" and is considered a precursor of acid jazz.\\n\\nHolmes burst onto the music scene in the early 1960s (his first album, on Pacific Jazz with guest Ben Webster was recorded in March 1961). An African-American, literally a heavyweight (approximately 300 pounds) and physically rotund in stature, he gained immediate respect with an inimitable style of his own. His sound was immediately recognizable in the upper register, but even more so because of his virtuosity in creating, undoubtedly, the most rapid, punctuating, and pulsating basslines of all the jazz organists. His Prestige recording of \"Live at the Front Room\" recorded in Newark, New Jersey is one of the great jazz performances on the Hammond-B3. He (Holmes) seemed to make fire jump from the Hammond organ the night of that live recording. Though his recording years were relatively brief, as he died at the less than advanced age of 60, he established a recognition that is stellar within the community of notable jazz organ giants,i.e. Jimmy Smith (The Sermon), Brother Jack McDuff (A Real Good 'Un), Jimmy McGriff (I've Got a Woman). His style whether ballad, standard, or uptempo straight ahead, was always soulful, as his nicknamed implied, he was a \"Groove\".\\n\\nHe recorded many albums for Pacific Jazz, Prestige Records, Groove Merchent and Muse Records.\\n\\nHolmes died after a long struggle with prostate cancer, having performed his last concerts on a wheelchair. One of his last gigs was at the 1991 Chicago Blues Festival with his longtime friend, singer Jimmy Witherspoon. &lt;a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Richard+%22Groove%22+Holmes\"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

       "      <th>James Cecil Dickens (born December 19, 1920 - January 2, 2015), better known as Little Jimmy Dickens, is an American country music singer famous for his humorous novelty songs, his small size, 4'11\" (150 cm), and his rhinestone-studded outfits. He started as a member of the Grand Ole Opry in 1948 and became a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1983.\\n\\nBorn in Bolt, West Virginia, Dickens began his musical career in the late 1930s, performing on a local radio station while attending West Virginia University. He soon quit school to pursue a full-time music career, and travelled the country performing on various local radio stations under the name \"Jimmy the Kid.\"\\n\\nIn 1948, Dickens was heard performing on a radio station in Saginaw, Michigan by Roy Acuff, who introduced him to Art Satherly at Columbia Records and officials from the Grand Ole Opry. Dickens signed with Columbia in September and joined the Opry in August. Around this time he began using the nickname, Little Jimmy Dickens, inspired by his short stature.\\n\\nDickens recorded many novelty songs for Columbia, including \"Country Boy,\" \"A-Sleeping at the Foot of the Bed\" and \"I'm Little But I'm Loud.\" His song \"Take an Old Cold Tater (And Wait)\" inspired Hank Williams to nickname him \"Tater\". Later, telling Jimmy he needed a hit, Williams penned \"Hey Good Lookin'\" specifically for Dickens in only 20 minutes while on a Grand Ole Opry tour bus. A week later Williams cut the song himself, jokingly telling him, \"That song's too good for you!\"\\nDickens in 1955.\\n\\nIn 1950 Dickens formed the Country Boys with musicians Jabbo Arrington, Grady Martin, Bob Moore and Thumbs Carllile and. It was during this time that he discovered future Hall of Famer Marty Robbins at a Phoenix, Arizona television station while on tour with Grand Ole Opry road show. In 1957 Dickens left the Grand Ole Opry to tour with the Philip Morris Country Music Show.\\n\\nIn 1962 Dickens scored his first top-10 country hit since 1954 with \"The Violet and the Rose\".\\n\\nIn 1964 Dickens became the first country artist to circle the globe while on tour, and also made numerous TV appearances including The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. In 1965 he released his biggest hit, \"May the Bird of Paradise Fly Up Your Nose,\" reaching No. 1 on the country chart and No. 15 on the pop chart.\\n\\nIn the late 1960s Dickens left Columbia for Decca Records, before moving again to United Artists in 1971. That same year he married his wife, Mona, and in 1975 he returned to the Grand Ole Opry. In 1983 Dickens was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.\\n\\nDickens joined producers Randall Franks and Alan Autry for the In the Heat of the Night cast CD “Christmas Time’s A Comin’” performing \"Jingle Bells\" with the cast on the CD released on Sonlite and MGM/UA for one of the most popular Christmas releases of 1991 and 1992 with Southern retailers.\\n\\nRecently Dickens has made appearances in a number of music videos by fellow country musician and West Virginia native Brad Paisley. He has also been featured on several of Paisley's albums in bonus comedy tracks along with other Opry mainstays such as George Jones and Bill Anderson. They are collectively referred to as the Kung-Pao Buckaroos.\\n\\nWith the passing of Hank Locklin in March 2009, Dickens became the oldest living member of the Grand Ole Opry at the age of 90. He still makes regular appearances as a host at the Opry, often with the self-deprecating joke that he is also known as \"Willie Nelson after taxes.\" At the 2011 CMA Awards, Jimmy was dressed up as Justin Bieber, and made fun of Bieber's recent paternity scandal. &lt;a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Little+Jimmy+Dickens\"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

       "      <th>Alfred Matthew \"Weird Al\" Yankovic (born October 23, 1959 in Downey, California) is an American singer-songwriter, music producer, actor, comedian, satirist, accordion player and kazooist. Yankovic is known in particular for his humorous songs that make light of popular culture and that often parody specific songs by contemporary musical acts. Since his first-aired song parody in 1976, he has sold more than 12 million albums—more than any other comedy act in history—recorded more than 150 parody and original songs, and has performed more than 1,000 live shows.His works have earned him three Grammy Awards among nine nominations, four gold records, and six platinum records in the United States. Yankovic's first top ten Billboard album (Straight Outta Lynwood) and single (\"White &amp; Nerdy\") were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career.\\n\\nIn addition to recording his albums, Yankovic has written and starred in his own film, UHF, and his own television show, The Weird Al Show, and directed music videos for himself and other artists including Ben Folds, Hanson, the Black Crowes and The Presidents of the United States of America. He has also made guest appearances on many television shows, in addition to starring in his own Al TV specials.\\n\\nThough parodies earned him his fame, Yankovic has recorded a greater number of humorous songs with original tunes. Some of these pieces are pastiches (or style parodies), where he chooses a band's entire body of work to emulate rather than any single hit, although Yankovic has many completely original pieces. Most of his albums include a medley which juxtaposes the choruses of various songs in a polka style to accordion music.\\n\\nDue to his popularity, he has been credited with several songs that are not actually his. A full list of every song he has ever actually done, including the live-only songs, can be found at the Al Songs website.  Similarly, a comprehensive list of songs incorrectly credited to him can be found at The Not Al Page.\\n\\nIn 2006, Al recorded the song \"You're Pitiful\". However, while James Blunt gave his blessing for the parody of his song, \"You're Beautiful\", Blunt's label Atlantic Records was opposed to it. Though parodies are protected legally, the issue had become \"more of a political matter than a legal matter\", according to Al, so he decided to not put the song on his next album. Instead, he offered it as a free download from his site.\\n\\nHis latest album, \"Straight Outta Lynwood\", was released September 26th, 2006. Its first released single, \"Don't Download This Song\", was made available as a free download on August 21, 2006. The animated video for the track and a link to downloadable MP3 is available at dontdownloadthissong.com. Among other tracks, the album includes parodies of Green Day, Usher, R. Kelly, and Chamillionaire. Chamillionaire's \"Ridin' Dirty\" is parodied as \"White and Nerdy\", the second released single from the new album.  This single has thus far climbed as far as #9 on the Billboard Singles chart, eclipsing \"Eat It\" as Al's highest charting single (which went as high as #12).\\n\\nOfficial Website: http://www.weirdal.com\\n\\n\\n\\nFactBox Info\\n\\nMembers\\n\\nAl Yankovic\\nJon ''Bermuda'' Schwartz\\nSteve Jay\\nJim West\\nRubén Valtierra\\n\\nFormer Members\\n\\nRick Derringer\\nRoss Noble\\nJoe Earley &lt;a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/%22Weird+Al%22+Yankovic\"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

       "      <th>Gloria Estefan (born Gloria María Fajardo, September 1, 1957, in Havana, Cuba) is a seven-time Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter, actress and social activist. Known as the \"Queen of Latin Pop\", she in the top 100 best-selling music artists with over 100 million albums sold worldwide, 31.5 million of those in the United States. Estefan is the most successful crossover performer in Latin music to date.\\n\\nBeginning her career in 1975 as lead vocalist for the then exclusively Spanish-language band, Miami Sound Machine, before crossing over to mainstream pop success with the international hit singles \"Dr. Beat\" (1984) and \"Conga\" (1986), Estefan emerged as one of the biggest new stars in the mid-'80s, predating the still nascent Latin pop explosion by a decade, and scoring a series of propulsive dance hits rooted in the rhythms of her native Cuba, before shifting her focus to softer, more ballad-oriented fare. \\n\\nBorn in Havana, Cuba, the young Gloria Fajardo was raised primarily in Miami, FL, after her father, a bodyguard of Cuban president Fulgencio Batista, was forced to flee the island following the 1959 coup helmed by Fidel Castro. In the fall of 1975, Fajardo and her cousin Merci Murciano auditioned for the Miami Latin Boys, a local wedding band headed by keyboardist Emilio Estefan. With their addition, the group was rechristened Miami Sound Machine and four years later, Fajardo and Estefan were wed. As Miami Sound Machine began composing their own original material, their fusion of pop, disco, and salsa earned a devoted local following, and in 1979 the group issued their first Spanish-language LP on CBS International. Despite a growing Hispanic fan base, they did not cross over to non-Latin audiences until \"Dr. Beat\" topped European dance charts in 1984. \\n\\nWith 1985's Primitive Love, Miami Sound Machine recorded their first English-language effort, scoring three Top Ten pop hits in the U.S. alone with the infectious \"Conga\", \"Bad Boy\", and \"Words Get in the Way\". Following 1987's triple-platinum Let It Loose, Estefan took top billing and the group changed its name to Gloria Estefan &amp; The Miami Sound Machine in 1988, reeling off four Top Ten hits - \"Rhythm Is Gonna Get You\", \"Can't Stay Away from You\", the chart-topping \"Anything for You\", and \"1-2-3\". 1989's Cuts Both Ways was credited to Estefan alone and generated her second #1 hit, \"Don't Wanna Lose You\". However, on March 20, 1990, while touring in support of the album, her bus was struck by a tractor trailer. Estefan suffered a broken vertebra that required extensive surgery and kept her off the road for over a year. Her husband Emilio and the couple's son were injured in the crash as well, but all three recovered. Estefan resurfaced in 1991 with Into the Light, again topping the charts with \"Coming Out of the Dark\", a single inspired by her near-fatal accident. Two more cuts from the album, \"Can't Forget You\" and \"Live for Loving You\", secured her foothold on the adult contemporary charts. \\n\\nWith 1993's Mi Tierra, Estefan returned to her roots, recording her first Spanish-language record in nearly a decade and earning a Grammy Award for Best Tropical Latin Album; on the follow-up 1994 covers collection, Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, she also recalled her dance-pop origins with a rendition of the Vicki Sue Robinson disco classic, \"Turn the Beat Around\". Another all-Spanish effort, Abriendo Puertas (1995), earned her a Grammy as well, while Destiny featured \"Reach\", named the official theme of the 1996 Summer Olympics. As Latin pop made new commercial headway, thanks to the efforts of acts like Ricky Martin and Enrique Iglesias, Estefan reigned as the most successful crossover artist in Latin music history, with international record sales close to the 50 million mark. In 1999, she also made her feature film debut alongside Meryl Streep in Music of the Heart, recording the film's title song as a duet with *NSYNC, and scoring both a massive pop hit and an Oscar nomination in the process. A new Spanish-language album, Alma Caribeña, followed in the spring of 2000. Several months later, Estefan was awarded a Grammy for Best Music Video for \"No Me Dehes de Querer\" at the inaugural annual Latin Grammy Awards. Her husband, Emilio, won for Producer of the Year. - Jason Ankeny, All Music Guide\\n\\nAppearances and tours\\nIn April 2004, Estefan appeared on the Fox Broadcasting Company’s program, American Idol, but declined an offer to be an official judge, saying she did not like to “judge” others. \\n\\nOn July 28, 2004, in a press conference hosted by Donald Trump at the Trump Tower, Estefan announced that her then-upcoming tour would be her final one. The Live and Re-Wrapped Summer/Fall 2004 Tour, her first tour in eight years was produced by Clear Channel Entertainment. The tour featured Estefan’s greatest hits, along with new material from Unwrapped. \\n\\nIn December 2006, Estefan appeared as a special guest singer on the UK talent show The X Factor. \\n\\nGloria's 11th studio album,Miss Little Havana. The Miss Little Havana Songfacts says that the first nine tracks tells the tale of a young girl who hooks up with the wrong guy in Miami after moving there from Cuba. All of these tracks were written or co-written by Pharrell Williams of The Neptunes. It is described by Estefan as a project in the vein of her 1998 hit album gloria!. \\n\\nSongfacts reports that \"Hotel Nacional\" debuted at #1 on Billboard's Latin countdown - the first time a female artist had achieved that feat since the chart was introduced in 1986. Both \"Wepa\" and \"Hotel Nacional\" achieved number one on Billboard Latin Songs and on Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs. \\n\\nEstefan started a reality show called The Next: Fame Is at Your Doorstep opposite Joe Jonas, Nelly and John Rich on the CW Network, where she, and the other three mentors are searched for the next big star, to record an album with Atlantic Records. Unlike other music reality shows, in this program, the mentors selected the \"candidates\" for the show, and trained them for a live performance, where they'd be voted for the best act of the day. The first season ended in October 2012, with musician Michael Ray, as the big finalist.\\n\\nThis same year, Estefan appeared as a musical guest in Tony Bennett's compilation of duets with Latin-American musicians, Viva Duets with a rendition of the song, \"Who Can I Turn To (When Nobody Needs Me)\". Weeks later, she helped the American version of Teleton, releasing the charity single \"Por Un Mundo Mejor\" along with Mexican singer Lucero, Dominican rapper El Cata and Mexican pop band, Reik. A video for the song was shot, with them recording the song, which was marked as the official hymn for the foundation.\\n\\nIn May 2013, she appears doing another duet with the song \"Think I'm In Love Again\" as part of the albums Duets released by Paul Anka.\\n\\nEstefan has announced she was working on a new album of covers, The Standards, released in September 2013. The album will feature some collaborations with artists like Laura Pausini, Dave Koz and Joshua Bell, and the selection of songs are mostly songs from the Great American songbook. Estefan released the first single, \"How Long Has This Been Going On?\", digitally on Amazon and iTunes on July 9, 2013\\n\\n\\nOfficial website: http://www.gloriaestefan.com\\n &lt;a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Gloria+Estefan\"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

The track features a guitar riff which became hugely popular. This guitar sound, which he accidentally found while experimenting with a new producing deck, became the trademark of his early hits. ATB continues to evolve and change with every album. His current style involves more vocals and varied sounds, with frequent pianos.\\n\\nDespite only releasing a few more singles in the UK, namely “Don’t stop!” (No.3, 300,000 copies sold) and “Killer” (No.4, 200,000 copies sold), he still regularly releases music in his native Germany and in other parts of Europe, where he has scored big hits such as “I Don’t Wanna Stop” and his cover of Olive’s 1996 hit “You’re Not Alone”.\\n\\n“Two Worlds” (2000) is a two-disc album based upon the concept of different types of music for different moods, with titles such as “The World Of Movement” and “The Relaxing World”.\\n\\nATB’s latest hits include uplifting “Ecstasy” and chilling “Marrakech”, both from the album “No Silence” (2004) and also released as singles.\\n\\nIn 2005, ATB released “Seven Years”, a compilation of 20 songs, including many greatest hits such as “The Summer”, “Let U Go”, “Hold U”, “Long Way Home”, and “I Don’t Wanna Stop”. Additionally, “Seven Years includes six new tracks: “Humanity”; “Let U Go (2005 Reworked)”; “Believe in Me”; “Trilogie, Pt. 2”; “Take Me Over”; and “Far Beyond”. Many of ATB’s recent albums have featured vocals from Roberta Carter Harrison, singer for the Canadian duo Wild Strawberries.\\n\\nHis next album was co-written by vocalist Tiff Lacey. “Trilogy” was released in 2007. The release of his second single “Justify” was moved from November 2006 to 2007. The single “Renegade” was released on 2007-04-12 and features Heather Nova.\\n\\nOn 2009-05-01 ATB released his latest album “Future Memories” featuring Josh Gallahan (a.k.a. jades) and others. The first single release of Future Memories which was also released on May 1st 2009 features What About Us and L.A. Nights.\\n\\nHis highly anticipated \"Distant Earth\" album was released 29th April 2011 and was comprised of 2CDs including combined work with Armin Van Buuren, Dash Berlin, Melissa Loretta and Josh Gallahan. A 3rd CD was also produced with all the club versions of the first CD hits. Singles released from the album include Twisted Love ft. Cristina Soto and Gold ft.

       "      <th>Joel Thomas Zimmerman (born January 5, 1981), better known as Deadmau5, is a Canadian progressive house, electro house and techno producer from Niagara Falls, Ontario. He is regarded as one of the world's most respected electronic music producers of modern times. In pop culture, he is known for wearing a large \"mau5head\" while performing at live events.\\n\\nThe Deadmau5 discography is currently comprised of eight studio albums, eight compilation albums, six mix albums, one soundtrack album, two remix albums, two video albums, seven extended plays, 55 singles, and 22 music videos.\\n\\nZimmerman's career in music began in 1999, releasing the vinyl pressed single \"I Don't Want No Other\" under Dred And Karma. Six years later, Deadmau5 released his debut studio album album, Get Scraped  on July 26, 2005, which featured more experimental genres different from his future sound. Within the following year, Zimmerman finished three compilation albums, Project 56, Deadmau5 Circa 1998–2002, and A Little Oblique, which were released on his (now retired) SectionZ page. \\n\\nOn November 6, 2006, he released his second studio album Vexillology, which marked the beginning of the signature Deadmau5 sound. In 2007, Zimmerman founded his own record label, Mau5trap, which released his third studio album Random Album Title on September 2, 2008. This was his first album to garner mainstream success, coining his unique style of progressive house and featuring the singles \"Faxing Berlin\", \"Not Exactly\" and \"I Remember\" (with Kaskade). \\n\\nDuring 2008, Zimmerman left Play Records. However, due to his contract agreement, Play Records was able to claim ownership of tracks he made during the time he was signed to the label. This led to the creation of the At Play series, which consisted of six mix albums released periodically from 2008 to 2015. \\n\\nOn September 22, 2009, Deadmau5 released his fourth studio album For Lack of a Better Name . In contrast of his previous album, For Lack of a Better Name  is based around tech house. Despite this switch in style, the album contains two of Zimmerman's greatest hits to date: \"Ghosts 'n' Stuff\" and \"Strobe\".  He expanded his EDM sound further with his fifth studio album, 4x4=12 which was released on December 6, 2010, and consisted of techno, electro house and the progressive house/dubstep mashup \"Raise Your Weapon\". In 2011, Deadmau5 released two non-album singles:  \"Aural Psynapse\" and \"HR 8938 Cephei\", with the former being a modern remake of an old song Zimmerman made under the alias Halcyon441.\\n\\nZimmerman revisited his roots with his sixth studio album, &gt; Album Title Goes Here &lt;, released on September 21, 2012. The album consists of house music along with songs in the ambient, glitch, and trip-hop genres. In November 2013, Zimmerman deleted three years worth of music from his SoundCloud account, replacing them with 7, an EP of seven melancholy piano sonatas named after the seven deadly sins. The same month, Zimmerman left Ultra Records and signed with record label Astralwerks.\\n\\nOn January 7, 2014, Deadmau5 announced on Twitter that his next project was complete. However, it was preceded by the weekly release of four singles, \"Avaritia\", \"Seeya\", \"Infra Turbo Pigcart Racer\" and \"Phantoms Can't Hang\" until his seventh studio album While(1&lt;2) was finally released on June 17. After this, Zimmerman would leave Astralwerks and not release any new music until May 27, 2016, with the digital single \"Snowcone\". This song was later included on his eighth studio album W:/2016ALBUM/, which was released on  December 2, 2016.\\n\\nIn 2017, Deadmau5 would go on to release a compilation album of his older works, Stuff I Used to Do on January 7, and the single \"Legendary\" on August 25. On March 30, 2018, Zimmerman released Where's the Drop?, a compilation album containing orchestral covers of previously released music, with the exception of \"Caritas\", an entirely original song. From July 13, 2018 to February 1, 2019, Deadmau5 released the Mau5ville series, three EPs which featured original work along with remixes and songs by other Mau5trap artists. On January 25, 2019, the movie Polar premiered on Netflix, with Zimmerman releasing the soundtrack album, Polar (Music from the Netflix Film)  the same day. In November, Zimmerman released three new singles, entitled \"Satrn\", \"Coasted\" and \"Fall\", released on the 16th, 22nd and 29th, respectively.\\n\\nThe following year, Deadmau5 would continue to release singles, with \"Pomegranate\" on May 20 and \"Bridged By a Lightwave\" on November 10. Both are expected to appear on Zimmerman's next studio album. On March 29, 2021, Zimmerman debuted a new, house-focused record label called Hau5trap, and simultaneously released the single \"Nextra\". He would go on to release \"Hypnocurrency\" on April 22 and \"When the Summer Dies\" on July 15.\\n\\nThroughout his career, Deadmau5 has won 15 competitive awards and received 42 nominations. Amongst his major achievements, Zimmerman has won five Beatport Music Awards, four DJ Awards, three International Dance Music Awards, three Juno Awards, and has also received six Grammy Award nominations and one World Music Award nomination.\\n\\nZimmerman has also worked with a number of artists both underground and mainstream, including Melleefresh, Steve Duda, Kaskade, MC Flipside, Rob Swire of Pendulum,  Chris Lake, Glenn Morrison, Wolfgang Gartner, Sofi, Chris James, Cypress Hill, Imogen Heap, Gerard Way, Colleen D'Agostino, Grabbitz, Attlas, Shotty Horroh, Lights, Mr. Bill, The Neptunes, Kiesza, and Rezz.\\n\\nThe name Deadmau5 originates from an incident where a mouse crawled into his computer and died. He posted this story on an internet forum, and members began calling him TheDeadMouseGuy. \"Dead Mouse\" was too long for an IRC login name, so he abbreviated it to \"deadmau5\". &lt;a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/deadmau5\"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

       "      <th>Kathryn Dawn Lang, OC (born November 2, 1961), better known under her stage name, k.d. lang, is a Grammy Award-winning Canadian singer and songwriter. She is regarded as one of Canada's foremost female vocalists, as well as a champion of legal equality for LGBT people.\\n\\nHer singing talent has lent itself to a wide range of genres, although earlier works, such as 'Angel With a Lariat' and 'Absolute Torch and Twang' (the last of which won her a  Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance) were predominantly country, with hints of jazz and salsa. Later works, including Ingénue and All You Can Eat, were more pop-ish in execution. No matter the genre, all left her talent undeniable. She has since garnered four grammys and many other awards, and was even made an officer of the Order of Canada in 1996, Canada's highest civilian honour.  &lt;a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/k.d.+lang\"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

       "      <th>Émilie Simon is a French singer and composer born on July 17, 1978 in Montpellier. She began her musical education at a French conservatory at 7 years old. By age 18, she was studying Musicology at the University in Montpellier, France, and then obtained her Master in Musicology at the Sorbonne in Paris. Émilie was intrigued by the idea of combining her traditional musical education with new music technologies and studio experimentations. She developed these interests into unique skills at the cutting edge new technology music school, the IRCAM in Paris, which to this day remains the only center in the world dedicated to contemporary musical research and production, bringing science and art together in order to widen instrumentation and rejuvenate musical language.\\n\\nHere she met Cyrille Brissot who she still works with today to develop and build specific instruments adapted to Émilie’s needs, both in the studio and on stage, including the “Brissot” - a breathtaking arm controller that allows her to remotely control, modulate and transform her live voice through a series of controlled effects.  Émilie uses a variety of other new technology devices including Yamaha’s “Tenori-on” and a variety of other new hardware and software. Émilie uses this technology to give herself a wide range of versatility on stage, including being able to control everything – from beats to multiple instruments to vocal harmonies and modulation simultaneously while alone on stage.\\n\\nShortly after Ircam, Émilie Simon signed a record deal with Barclay/Universal France. Her debut single, entitled “Désert” was released in October 2002. Since then, she has written, arranged, performed and produced her two records and the original music for the French (original) version of March of the Penguins. There, Émilie used many diverse and inventive techniques including rubbing pieces of ice together to produce beats and sounds, and blended them with her electronic machinery and inviting lyrics. \\n\\nDespite garnering best album honors in the electronic category at France’s\\n“Victoires de la Musique” Awards for her debut, and being touted as one of the most promising female artists, the Montpellier-bred chanteuse is quick to champion her independence as an artist over such acclaim. “[Awards] are nice, but it’s like a cherry on top, really,” the singer/songwriter insists. “It’s great when you have the feeling you are doing something important or that you’re understood. But it doesn’t alter the way I work in any way. I’m always thinking back on what I have done, because I don’t want to be redundant. I want to make music without rules, without anybody telling me what I have to do.”\\n\\nÉmilie Simon first made her mark on the U.S. in the fall of 2006 with her debut U.S. release, The Flower Book on Nov. 7, 2006. Her plush, artful soundscapes had already yielded her significant praise and awards in her French homeland, as well as acclaim across the rest of Europe and Japan. Singing in both French and English, Émilie allows her music to flow naturally, rewarding her with devoted fans worldwide. A year and a half after The Flower Book’s release, Émilie is currently residing in New York City and writing her next record. She will be performing shows in NYC this Fall to preview her new material. Having always begun the creative process in the recording studio, and then following with live performances, Émilie is trying a new approach. For the new record, she will let the songs breathe and evolve in a live environment before heading into the studio. &lt;a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Emilie+Simon\"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

       "      <th>Born 1986 in the suburban Icelandic town of Mosfellsbær, a few kilometers outside of Reykjavík, composer/performer Ólafur Arnalds has always enjoyed pushing boundaries with both his studio work and live-shows. Since the release of his debut album \"Eulogy for Evolution\" in 2007 he has built up a dedicated international following and is well established for his genre-crossing compositions blending classical, pop and ambient/electronica influences to a unique musical language.\\n\\nStarting out as drummer for several hardcore/metal bands, Ólafur was asked to write instrumental intros and outros for the album \"Antigone\" of German metal band Heaven Shall Burn. This led to more work in the field of neo-classical strings and piano based music, and ultimately to the release of Eulogy for Evolution and the beginning of Ólafur's partnership with Berlin based label Erased Tapes. In 2008 he embarked on a tour with fellow Icelanders Sigur Rós.\\n\\nIn 2009 he started a week-long project of composing one track by day, making it immediately available online to his fans. The collection was later officially released under the title Found Songs. He repeated the same experiment in 2011 under the title Living Room Songs. Also in 2009 the ballet Dyad 1909 premiered with a score composed by Ólafur. Choreographed by Wayne McGregor and performed by Wayne McGregor Random Dance, the ballet was inspired by Ernest Shackleton’s Nimrod Expedition to the South Pole in 1909. That year he also started Kiasmos, together with Janus Rasmussen. Kiasmos is a minimal techno based project. Their self titled debut album was released in 2014, preceded by the Thrown EP.\\n\\nIn April 2010 Ólafur released his second full-length album entitled ...And They Have Escaped The Weight Of Darkness, which was backed up with an extensive tour, including his first trip to China.\\n\\nHis third album, and the first to be released under his new partnership with Universal Music's Mercury Classics imprint, is titled For Now I Am Winter and planned for international release in February 2013. Expanding on his previous work the new album features a full orchestra and – for the first time – introduces vocals to his soundworld. Icelandic singer Arnór Dan is to be heard on four tracks of the album.\\n\\nMore recently Ólafur has been venturing into the world of films, writing his first Hollywood film score to Another Happy Day. He also had music in the hit film The Hunger Games and has been featured several times on popular American television show So You Think You Can Dance. For 2013 his scores include the music to the ITV thriller series Broadchurch, starring David Tennant and Olivia Colman, as well as to the film Gimme Shelter, directed by Ron Krauss and starring Vanessa Hudgens and Brendan Fraser.\\n\\nIn 2014 Arnalds won the prestigious BAFTA Television Craft Award for his score to the BBC's hit detective series 'Broadchurch'. &lt;a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/%C3%93lafur+Arnalds\"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.
