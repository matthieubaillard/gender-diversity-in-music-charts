## Data sources and data collection:

### 1) Billboard Hot 100 - USA, 1958-2022

### 2) Franceâ€™s Top 50 (1984-1998) & Top 100 (1998-2020)

Official publisher of the official charts for singles sales in France, compiled by GFK Music for the SNEP (Syndicat National de l'Edition Phonographique)
cf. Jupyter Notebook projet.ipynb for the scraping code
top50.csv

### 3) MusicBrainz API
Artist metadata fetched from their API for artists in either of above charts (not all artists are perfect matches, and we couldn't manually picerrors in the project's limited time; e.g. Japanese post-rock band Boris obviously isn't the French one-hit novelty that charted in the 90'sthough I wish Boris from Japan had hits on the radio :-))
cf. Jupyter Notebook projet.ipynb for the fetching code

### 4) Last.fm API
Artist bios fetched through their API. Bios which we use for the machine learning.
