Boris are a Japanese experimental    metal band formed in Tokyo in 1992.  The band\\'s original lineup consisted of lead vocalist Atsuo, bassist/rhythm guitarist Takeshi, lead guitarist Wata, and drummer Nagata.  After Nagata\\'s departure in 1996, Atsuo took over drums and the lineup has remained consistent to this day.  Boris draw influence from a huge variety of styles including, but not limited to, psychedelic rock, punk rock, sludge metal, doom metal, drone metal, pop, noise, shoegaze, and ambient.  The band\\'s name is taken from a song on Melvins\\' album, Bullhead. They released their debut full-length album, Absolutego, on their own label, Fangs Anal Satan, in 1996. They\\'ve since gone on to release over 20 studio albums, as well as a number of EPs, singles, and collaborations on various labels around the world. They have an especially close collaborative relationship with Merzbow, having released three studio albums, a 12\\\\\" EP, and two live albums with the noise artist as of 2016.\\\\n\\\\nBoris saw a huge increase in popularity between 2003 and 2006 when Southern Lord reissued some of their works in North America, garnering them critical acclaim and recognition in Western music press.  Pink, originally released in 2005 in Japan via Diwphalanx, was reissued in 2006 by Southern Lord and met with a very positive reception in the US.  Blender magazine and SPIN magazine both named it one of the year\\'s best albums.  The album also made the top of the metal section in Canadian magazine Exclaim\\'s reader\\'s poll of that year, and was in the top 10 of Pitchfork Media\\'s top 50 records of the year.\\\\n\\\\nhttps://borisheavyrocks.com/\\\\n\\\\n2. Boris (full name: Boris Titulaer, born in Venlo, The Netherlands, 3 October 1980)  is a Dutch male soul/pop singer. He was the winner of the second season of the \\'Idols\\' talents contest  (2004) on Dutch TV. His first single, \\'When You Think of Me\\', was a #1  hit in The Netherlands, selling over 80,000 copies and receiving platinum status. Boris\\' début album, Rely on Me (2004), was certified gold in The Netherlands (40,000+ copies) within one week. \\\\n\\\\nTwo more albums as Boris followed: Holy Pleasure (2006) and Live My Life (2009), but Boris\\' glory days seemed over. He resurfaced in later years using monikers such as Bo-Rush, I Am Boris and - most notably - Bo Saris. His only album under the latter name, entitled Gold (2014), seemed to re-ignite his career, but not much has been heard of him since. <a href=\\\\\"https://www.last.fm/music/Boris\\\\\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band\\'s musical style has varied greatly from album to album; encompassing their early indie-leanings passing through \\'60s-inspired pop and more band-based rock. Their current lineup is Nina Persson on vocals, Peter Svensson on lead guitar, Magnus Sveningsson on bass guitar,  Bengt Lagerberg on drums and Lars-Olof Johansson on keyboards and guitar. \\\\n\\\\nThe five-piece met as teenagers in Jönköping, Sweden, a town whose only distinguishing feature is its 52 churches. In October 1992, bonded by their mutual love of hard rock and folk music (they listed Nick Drake and Iron Maiden as their two biggest influences by 1994), guitarist Peter Svensson and bassist Magnus Sveningsson conceived The Cardigans. As their hometown was hardly a Mecca of musical enterprise, the group packed up and moved to the somewhat more central fishing port of Malmö, Sweden\\'s third largest city, to seek their fortune. With Peter writing most of the music and the band as a whole composing the lyrics, the quintet set out to find a deal.\\\\n\\\\nAfter an early recording of \\\\\"Rise & Shine\\\\\" appeared on a local independent label in 1994, The Cardigans were swiftly signed to Stockholm Records. The same year the band made their debut for the label with Emmerdale and later won the accolade of \\\\\"Best Album of 1994\\\\\" from Slitz, at the time Sweden\\'s leading music magazine. The rise of The Cardigans has since been gradual, allowing them the time to develop naturally as their sales and positive exposure grew with each release. Their second long-player, Life, which followed in 1995, featured the hit singles \\\\\"Carnival\\\\\" and the re-recorded \\\\\"Rise & Shine\\\\\", and witnessed the band\\'s first international chart success. Prior to the First Band on the Moon album in September 1996, The Cardigans released \\\\\"Lovefool\\\\\". Although the first response to the single was very positive and landed them in the Top 40, it achieved nowhere near the impact that awaited it the following Spring.\\\\n\\\\nIt was in 1997 that The Cardigans were first catapulted towards international superstardom. \\\\\"Lovefool\\\\\"\\'s inclusion on the blockbuster Romeo and Juliet film soundtrack that Spring pushed them past the boiling point. The single not only reached No. 1 on both the United Kingdom and United States airplay charts but also debuted at No. 2 on the United Kingdom national chart, where it remained top five for five weeks. All in all, the album reached more than 2.5 million sales worldwide, achieving Platinum status in the United States and Japan, but only achieving Gold in the United Kingdom. The promotional activities supporting the worldwide success of \\\\\"Lovefool\\\\\" and First Band On The Moon were never ending. The band not only performed a year long world tour complete with endless radio sessions and press and television interviews, but even ended up making guest appearances on Beverly Hills 90210 and the David Letterman Show.\\\\n\\\\nIt was because of the sheer exhaustion resulting from such a schedule, that The Cardigans since took some well deserved time off at home in Malmö to recuperate their artistic juices and write new material. During their time off, however, the band was by no means dormant. In the beginning of 1999 they contributed a new track, \\\\\"War\\\\\", to the A Life Less Ordinary soundtrack, a live recording of \\\\\"Been It\\\\\" to the Lilith Fair compilation and \\\\\"Deuce\\\\\", featured on The X-Files: The Album, an X-Files soundtrack album. Their break also included experimentation with various solo projects.\\\\n\\\\nIn June 1998, the group, who are very loyal to their roots, once again joined long-time producer Tore Johansson at his studio, Country Hell, located beside the picturesque Svaneholm Castle in Malmö and recorded the album, Gran Turismo.\\\\n\\\\nThe first single \\\\\"My Favourite Game\\\\\", was a major hit in many territories. The video for \\\\\"My Favourite Game\\\\\" was directed by Jonas Åkerlund. The song was also included in the soundtrack of the hit Playstation racing game, Gran Turismo 2, were it was the intro theme. The second single \\\\\"Erase/Rewind\\\\\" was released in January 1999, and this single also turned out to be a major hit around the world. \\\\n\\\\nGran Turismo reached more than 2.5 million sales worldwide.\\\\n\\\\nThe album Long Gone Before Daylight was released in February 2003 and from the album the singles \\\\\"For What It\\'s Worth\\\\\" and \\\\\"You\\'re The Storm\\\\\" were taken. The album received great reviews and the band spent most of 2003 touring Europe and North America.\\\\n\\\\nIn Fall 2005, the band released, Super Extra Gravity.\\\\n\\\\nOfficial site: http://www.cardigans.com <a href=\\\\\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Cardigans\\\\\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
